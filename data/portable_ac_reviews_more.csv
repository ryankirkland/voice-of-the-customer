I did a lot of research and found this amazing air conditioner.  Honestly it's more quiet then most I have heard it easy to assemble.. I am a female in my 30's and did it myself.. the portion that goes in The window which mine is about 58"" in height at my apartment.. fits perfect!! I read a lot of reviews about people having to cut but that was not the case. I waited the 24 hours as suggested in the manual to turn it on after delivery to let everything settle I guess and ran it all day today. It is More quiet than expected and my apartment is definitely cool. It doesn't really reach the bedroom but it is the design of the apartment..

It arrived two days after ordering and reading cautionary review here, I let it sit for 24 hours - which is also now recommended on the both the box and supplementary instruction sheet inside the shipping box - to let the refrigerant resettle. Installation was easy, although as the manual for the unit advises some improvising was in order. Instead of using the foam strips that came with the unit, I bought a couple rolls of self-adhesive Sponge Window Seal tape from HomeDepot; 3/4"" and 1-1/4"" wide rolls. My widow is a slider and has a vertical opening 56"" which is more than the self-adhesive foam supplied with the unit. The sponge seal tape was also much thicker (3/8"") than the unit foam. I followed the instructions using my seal tapes and made nice seals. The three piece Winder Slider was at max extension, so in addition the the screws I used some white duct tape to reenforce the it. I also ran the white duct tape over the form so that it closed the seams and hide the black sponge form seal strips. I they bought some white thin foam poster from the local craft store to cover over the window opening opposite the ac exhaust port/slider and block outside light. Lastly I did use the non-adhesive foam strip to seal the vertical gap between the window frame and outer window - just sort of pushed it into the gap. Like any ac unit it is going to make noise and you will know its on. I took some sound level readings. At 2 feet; with the unit off the ambient room level was 33 dB and with it running set to 72 degrees it was 58 dB.Until I read the user guide I really didn't know that this was a semi-permanent installation in the window, which it is. It can be moved at the end of the summer heat season, but you'll have to go though the whole foam seal and tape routine to reinstall it. if you want to leave the window slider kit and seals in place you'll have to deal with the hose attachment hole as it doesn't come with a cap or plug for the opening of the window slider kit. If I decide to disconnect the unit and put in storage closet, I will probably make a cover/cap out of the foam board and tape over the hole - but it would be nice it it just came with a cap for the hole.

167,167,B01DLPUWGW,,"August 10, 2020",Verified Purchase,It will do,"  I bought this because the 20 year old in wall air conditioner in my bedroom has started acting up periodically and I don’t want anyone in my apartment right now. Also, the one in the living room is just as old, so if they both end up no longer usable this is a great portable solution. As others may have written, don’t expect this to be quiet or as chilling as your window or in wall unit. But it’s enough to cool down a room to a comfortable temperature to fall asleep, and when it reaches the set temperature the fan is fairly quiet. The majority of the noise comes from the rush of air, and as far as I can tell there is no discernible difference between fan speeds. The remote works well.

Also, the one in the living room is just as old, so if they both end up no longer usable this is a great portable solution. As others may have written, don’t expect this to be quiet or as chilling as your window or in wall unit. But it’s enough to cool down a room to a comfortable temperature to fall asleep, and when it reaches the set temperature the fan is fairly quiet. The majority of the noise comes from the rush of air, and as far as I can tell there is no discernible difference between fan speeds. The remote works well.

So I ended up finding a 10,000 BTU TOSHIBA Portable at Home Depot figuring Toshiba had to be at least as good as Black and Decker, if not better. Wrong, the Black and Decker blows it away in performance and it's not just the extra 2,000 BTU's because I have the Toshiba in a room 1/3 of the size, only a 10' x 10' room so 10,000 BTU's should be vast overkill, but it's not, at all.

Likewise I gave it only 4 stars for energy efficiency because I don't know yet, I haven't gotten the electric bill yet. The 4 stars for warmth are because if you run the exhaust hose out too far it will throw quite a bit of heat, which is a testament to it's efficiency: an A/C unit is essentially a heat pump; it doesn't put cold air in, it takes hot air out...as exhaust. It doesn't matter to me because I just pushed the unit up against the wall where I wanted to use it, marked the outlet there, and cut a 6"" hole right through the wall ducting it to the outside directly using only 6"" of fully collapsed exhaust hose so there is no detectable heat transfer at all.

If I had left my vegetables outside on kitchen countertops, they turned yellow or brown quickly because the indoor temperatures are so high lately. I do have an AC in the apartment, but I'm reluctant to use unless it's necessary, when pets or elderly are at home. Once I turn that baby up, there's no way I'm turning it down, and my electric bills skyrockets.Most of the time, I live alone, so in order to cut down on electricity bills and still stay cool, that's when this Mikikin Portable Air Conditioner Fan address two of my concerns amazingly, and here's why:PROS==== * Effective: this tiny box actually provides really cool air to your own personal space, I slept well last night without having to keep energy hogging AC on all night * 💘💝❄️❄️The Technology ❄️❄️:💓💕 while being so tiny yet able to provide cool air is this unit contains a ""Negative Ion Generator"" which generates negative ions to break up the water molecules, allowing to dry your hair faster in Negative Ion Hair Dryer.

I bought this for my teenage son’s desk so that we don’t have to use the house AC often.  It did helped a lot to make the air more cool.The package was smaller than I expected.  The box is thin with minimal branding.  Inside the box is the portable AC, a plastic squeeze bottle, and a mini USB cable.  I like the matte finish as it is not a fingerprint magnet.  The build quality is ok, sturdy enough to withstand a few bumps. It’s very small and cute, I was skeptical at first if it has enough power to really cool a small space.  It has no power adapter, but you can connect this to any USB port to power it up and charge the batteries.  The batteries are good to have for total portability, but we’re using this mostly plugged on top of a desk.  There are only 2 buttons for operations, it was a little confusing at first, but after reading the user manual, it is simple to operate.  I was surprised how powerful this small fan is, it blows a lot of air for its size.  The product has a small access door on the side to fill in the water compartment, but you can also slide out the entire back cover to separate the water compartment for refills.  I prefer to do the later for easier and faster refills.  It does blow a cool breeze when filled with water.  On a hot day, it is very helpful to cool a small space like a workstation or desk space.  My son also uses this while he sleeps beside his nightstand.  Not the coolest, but you can definitely feel a big difference in comfort.Overall, it’s a great little product.

306,306,B087CQVC9G,Size: for Rooms up to 275 sq ft (Alexa enabled),"August 25, 2020",Not Verified,"Great cooling, draining could be more convenient","  The Midea Smart 3-in-1 Portable Air Conditioner does an awesome job cooling. I ran this in a room that is approximately 13 x 16 with 12-foot ceilings (208 square feet or 2496 cubic feet). The higher ceilings mean this room has a lot more air to cool that you’d think by the 208 square foot floor area, but the Midea AC dropped it 4 degrees in 30 minutes on a very hot day.This A/C has some really thoughtful design touches, it’s easy to roll, a dream to set up, the plastic accessories are VERY heavy duty, and it works really, really well. Did I mention it was easy to set up and cooled an incredible amount? At 42 degrees, the air coming out of this baby is 2-4 degrees colder than my 5-ton Goodman A/C unit is putting out.What’s not to love? Well, the instruction booklet could use a re-write. Some parts of it – especially those regarding draining – are very confusing and pictures are misleading. So it took some extra work to puzzle things out. It also talks about the heater and heat pump, even though there is no heater in this unit. Confusing. The instruction book and the drainage system both need work.Note: You cannot run a drain tube up and out the window as is shown in the pictures from this A/C; it just won’t work. By the way, this A/C has two drain tubes: one at the bottom of the back and one mid-center of the back. Frankly, this A/C unit needs a good removable drain tray as part of its design. You definitely want a tray or low tub for this to drain into. We live in a semi-arid region and this still pulled water out of the air.  In addition, to drain this when you’re getting ready to put it away, you really need to lay it flat on its back, which you need to do very gently, so you don’t break said drain off. I laid it – very gently – on a layer of towels to do this. Plus, you’re supposed to run this fan-only for 12 hours to completely dry it out before storing to prevent mildew and mold. I’m running it 24 hours, even at our low humidity, because I do NOT want this to mold.The unit can use the remote for sensing temperature and using that to base its operation off of, rather than taking the temp at the unit itself. Very nice touch! I did not use the smart app because we’re using this as a temporary A/C. If we were using it permanently in one room, we would use the app. But with the remote and using it temporarily in one room, the app didn’t add enough that we felt it was useful.Overall, I’m incredibly pleased with how well this unit works, although I really wish the drainage system was designed with a built-in removable tray. Two drains to work with totally outside the unit is a bit inconvenient. However, even with that inconvenience, I really like this thing.As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart. Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

Did I mention it was easy to set up and cooled an incredible amount? At 42 degrees, the air coming out of this baby is 2-4 degrees colder than my 5-ton Goodman A/C unit is putting out.What’s not to love? Well, the instruction booklet could use a re-write. Some parts of it – especially those regarding draining – are very confusing and pictures are misleading. So it took some extra work to puzzle things out. It also talks about the heater and heat pump, even though there is no heater in this unit. Confusing. The instruction book and the drainage system both need work.Note: You cannot run a drain tube up and out the window as is shown in the pictures from this A/C; it just won’t work. By the way, this A/C has two drain tubes: one at the bottom of the back and one mid-center of the back. Frankly, this A/C unit needs a good removable drain tray as part of its design. You definitely want a tray or low tub for this to drain into. We live in a semi-arid region and this still pulled water out of the air.  In addition, to drain this when you’re getting ready to put it away, you really need to lay it flat on its back, which you need to do very gently, so you don’t break said drain off. I laid it – very gently – on a layer of towels to do this. Plus, you’re supposed to run this fan-only for 12 hours to completely dry it out before storing to prevent mildew and mold. I’m running it 24 hours, even at our low humidity, because I do NOT want this to mold.The unit can use the remote for sensing temperature and using that to base its operation off of, rather than taking the temp at the unit itself. Very nice touch! I did not use the smart app because we’re using this as a temporary A/C. If we were using it permanently in one room, we would use the app. But with the remote and using it temporarily in one room, the app didn’t add enough that we felt it was useful.Overall, I’m incredibly pleased with how well this unit works, although I really wish the drainage system was designed with a built-in removable tray. Two drains to work with totally outside the unit is a bit inconvenient. However, even with that inconvenience, I really like this thing.As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart. Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

I am comparing it to the LG brand LP1419IVSM which I already had.

Not quiet.","  Summary: This powerful air conditioner is keeping my 400 sf non-insulated garage cool during a heat wave! The remote and app make it easy to use. It is sturdily made, the wheels are convenient, and it looks nice. However, the exhaust system can only fit a sliding window, using a non-insulated window-panel with no outside extension. The filter is just a screen. It is inconvenient to drain. And it is as loud as a window air conditioner.My experience: Once I wrestled this 70 pound air conditioning unit into my garage, it was easy to maneuver on strong small wheels with a low center of gravity so it does not tip over too easily. I plugged it into a normal household outlet, and it ran fine. The unit has a nice modern look, and it feels sturdy and non-breakable. The app was as easy to install, but my wifi is weak in my garage, so I am using the physical remote, which works fine. It is doing a great job, and even though I have the 12000 BTU model, it is doing fine keeping my non-insulated 400 square foot garage at a comfortable temperature during outside temperatures over 90 F this week.Why only 4 stars? I would give it 5 stars for it’s power alone, and it has features that I appreciate. But I find two issues that bother me. The hot air exhaust is a typical round hose with a rectangular non-insulated window-frame panel and no external extension of the hose. So it only fits one type of window. On a hot day, a lot of heat is coming through that panel, especially because the hot exhaust air cannot be diverted farther from the window. Also, the filter is really just a screen, which does very little for air quality. It will take large particles and fibers out of the air, but it does nothing about allergens or odors, and it misses a lot of dust.Other suggestions for improvements: Larger wheels would make it easier to move this 70 lb unit on uneven surfaces. Drainage could be made more convenient. Provide a bluetooth option, or improve the sensitivity of the wifi receiver so the app can be used with weak wifi. Finally, i have had quiet window units, and i dont know how they do it, but this would be much nicer if it were quieter.Dont get me wrong. I like this air conditioner, and i am happy at the improvement to my garage workspace.

My house is over 150 years old and needs an update. We have no central heating/ac so in summer time we use window units. They make it comfortable but in all the years I've lived here and all the many AC's we've bought I've NEVER had one cool a room as quickly and efficiently as this Midea brand. My Midea window unit is whisper quiet and I wondered if this portable AC would be as well.....it is! If you tune in you're going to hear it but it's a white noise that I don't ever pick out of the crowd of noises in my home. I'm not savvy with set-ups of any kind but I was able to set this one up myself. I had to have my son carry it - the box says it weighs 69 lbs. This is in his room - an attic converted into a bedroom that needs new insulation. It's always hot up there. Always. But not anymore. Within 15 minutes we felt cool, and within a half hour the room was cooler than we've ever been able to get it with our other portable AC units. If you're shopping for an AC unit you want THIS brand.

It works hard to keep my family cool and I'm beyond happy with it.",AleashaMatthews,5.0,"Midea AC's are the way to go!!  I will never use any other brand for AC's after having used Midea. My house is over 150 years old and needs an update. We have no central heating/ac so in summer time we use window units. They make it comfortable but in all the years I've lived here and all the many AC's we've bought I've NEVER had one cool a room as quickly and efficiently as this Midea brand. My Midea window unit is whisper quiet and I wondered if this portable AC would be as well.....it is! If you tune in you're going to hear it but it's a white noise that I don't ever pick out of the crowd of noises in my home. I'm not savvy with set-ups of any kind but I was able to set this one up myself. I had to have my son carry it - the box says it weighs 69 lbs. This is in his room - an attic converted into a bedroom that needs new insulation. It's always hot up there. Always. But not anymore. Within 15 minutes we felt cool, and within a half hour the room was cooler than we've ever been able to get it with our other portable AC units. If you're shopping for an AC unit you want THIS brand. Some states are even offering rebates for Midea's AC's. This is a smart ac however, that's the one feature we don't use. We control ours manually and it works just fine.

On the high side, it effectively cools up to a 350 square foot room and is easy to operate.  On the downside, it is a very heavy unit, is loud, and Wi-Fi was difficult to set up.WHAT'S IN THE BOXThe unit comes with a hose adapter, window slider adapter, exhaust hose, window slider, various foam seals, short drain hose and drain hose adapter, a remote control, and a user's manual.THE AIR CONDITIONERThis is a very nice looking air conditioner.  It is 29 inches high, 17 inches wide, and 13"" in depth at its thickest point.  I did not weigh the air conditioner, but it is quite heavy.  It is rated at nearly 68 pounds by Amazon, but I think some of the shipping weight was due to the packaging and accessories.  Still, it probably weighs in in the 60-65 pound range so it is a bit of a bear to carry around.  It does have two handles on the sides, but given the bulk it is still difficult to carry.  That said, it is lighter than my older Penguino unit and, unlike the Penguino, it rolls freely on it's integrated wheels.  So once you get it on the right level of your house, it's easy to move from room to room, eon hard wood or on low pile carpet.Atop, there is a control panel that utilizes green LEDs, buttons for each display.  There is an LED number display for the temperature setting.  The controls are well layed out, easy to use, and make a lot of sense.The back of the unit has the exhaust hose port and the port for water drainage (which is covered).  The front has the vents (louvers) to direct the cool air.  These can be positioned as just open or can swing up and down.  (There is no way to direct air side to side.)The remote control (batteries included!), is an old-style remote with an LCD temperature display, and also is well layed out and easy to use.SET UPBasically, you attach the connectors to the hose.  Fit the slider in the window of your choice.  Attache the hose to the exhaust port and the other end into the window slider port.  Both hose ports ports have secure connections.  On my much older Penguino brand, the hose connections were a major problem. The either the connector would disengage from the window or the unit or the hose would flip out out the connector.  The Midea system is much, much better in this respect.PLEASE NOTE: given that the hose exits from the back and needs to curl around to attach to the window, the unit cannot fit flush with the wall.  The unit ends up sitting ~ 1 foot from the wall due to hose related issues and the unit is already 13"" deep.  If you orient it face forward, it will stick out about 25"" from the wall, so you need to account for this.  If you decide to have it face sideways (may make it a little more difficult to access the controls), it would still stick out at least 17"", as it is 17"" wide.  At some point, it would be great if manufacturers of these units would have the exhaust ports on the side, so the unit could sit flush with the wall.  (To avoid the need for left handed or right handed unit, they could make an exhaust port on the side with a lever to direct the air on one side or the other.)Unlike a standard window unit, setting this up in a window is a breeze.  You do not have  to position a very heavy air conditioning unit or secure the window.  The slider simply sits on the sill and you expand it.  You can still move the window up and down.  If you are connecting the air conditioner on a ground floor, you may need to secure the window so that no one will break in, but there is no need to secure the window so that your air conditioner will not fall to the ground. By the same token, it's easy to roll the air conditioner to another location and set it up in a different window.If you decide to use this as a dehumidifier only, you will need to buy a longer drain hose.  The hose that is supplied is only two feet long. This is way too short for any set up I could think of.COOLING/USEI was really impressed at how well it cools.  The device is rated at 14,000 BTU (ASHRE) or 8200 BTU (SACC standard). I would say, as a rule of thumb, that these free standing devices never quite cool as well per BTU as their in-the-window relatives.  My older free standing device is rated at 12,000 BTU, however, and this unit knocks the pants off of it.  It seems to cool our room with the same efficacy as a window unit rated at ~8000 BTU if this helps.Settings include:1) Mode: Auto, cool, dry (dehumidify only), fan2) Fan: Auto, high, mid, low (the fan will usually just kick in when needed; you can opt to keep it on constantly by pressing the fan button for three seconds)3) Temperature Setting: you can set the goal temperature for coling modes4) Swing: control the vent louvers to either stay stationary and push air forward or to swing up and down (there is no right to left swing option)Wireless: this activates the Wi-Fi and is needed for set up only5) Sleep Mode: this will lower the air conditioning overnight for a period; the curve is preset.  You can adjust it but only using the app.6) Timer: you can set the timer by pressing the timer button and selecting the time to shut off using the temperature control LEDs7) Additionally, you can set the LED lights as always on or off using either the handheld remote or the app (there is no LED control on the unit's control panel)8) You can set schedules using the app, but not on the unit itselfAll features work as you would expect them to.  There is no 'Eco' setting per se, but the Auto setting works well to keep the room cool and turn off the air conditioner when it is not needed.  As above, at default the fan will shut off when not needed; if you prefer to have it on constantly you can press the fan button for three seconds.  There is an indicator light to show that the fan is on constant mode.The controls on the control panel are set up logically and--at least for a modern, Wi-Fi capable device seem a little retro/90s, but they absolutely work and it is very easy to see the settings and what you are doing.Cooling is excellent and the auto mode functions as is expected. I have set the device up for use as an air conditioner (not as a dehumidifier) so I have not connected the drain hose.  The unit still works well in dry (dehumidify) mode and I have had no problems or errors.  I'm assuming that the moisture is vented through the exhaust port but if you are only using it as a dehumidifier, your exhaust port would not be connected to a window and you'd need a drain connected.  Well, at any rate, no errors or problems in any mode...NOISE:When the compressor kicks in fully, the air conditioner puts out 65-70 dB of noise.  Realize that 70 dB is actually twice the loudness of 60 dB.  So you go from the equivalent of 'conversation in a restaurant' to 'vacuum cleaner' when the compressor really kicks in.  At baseline, the thing is down around 50 dB which is tolerable.The problem, of course, is when you are sleeping at night.  The thing is humming, pleasantly, around 50 dB and you are sleeping.  At some point, the compressor kicks in at 65-70 dB and the change is loud enough to wake you up.  Remember, as well, that dB levels do not account for the quality of the sound.  The compressor kick in is a two parter, with a higher pitch whine followed by a mechanical thud and low pitch hum when it goes into full gear.I can sleep through anything, but not so much my wife.  We've decided that in a very hot summer, it is still easier to sleep with the noise than the humidity and the heat, but before buying this unit, you should take this into consideration.WONKY WI-FI SET UP/2.4 GHZ vs. 5 GHZ WI-FI ISSUESWi-Fi set up was a challenge for me.  It took me quite some time to figure out the problem, but the major issue is that you can ONLY set up the Wi-Fi app on a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signal.  The more modern 5 GHz Wi-Fi will NOT work for set up. (Although, once everything was set up, the app worked on all devices.)The quick solution--set it up on an Android phone after you go into settings and restrict the signal to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi only.In all fairness, the app warns you, but: 1) it really didn't register for me that this would be a problem, as both my iPhone and router work on both frequencies (you'd think the app would self adjust); 2) the app goes through all the steps (and man, does that take time) and then only tanks at the end when you reach 99% set up; 3) the app does not self adjust the frequency on your phone AND does not tell you how or point you in the direction of how to solve the problem.I really had a hard time with this.  For one, I have a modern router that works on both 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, but--wouldn't cha know--I could not figure out how to get either my iPhone or router to only play in the 2.4 GHz frequency range while I was setting up. And, yes.  I tried.Although my computer detects two networks from my router, one for each band, my iPhone only shows one network.  In an effort to 'keep things simple,' there is apparently no setting to restrict to 2.4 GHz only.  Ditto for my Netgear MR60 router--there are a gazillion settings for just about everything but none to cut off the 5 GHz signal and work on 2.4 GHz alone.  Why?  I don't know.  Why would the app not adjust the Wi-Fi to work with the proper signal?  I don't know.  Why would the app connect to a 5 GHz signal and not error before it 'tried' to connect.  I don't know.  Given that 5 GHz is the modern standard, they should upgrade their hardware or at least get the software to settle conflicts automatically.Before giving up, I used my wife's Android phone to try to set up.  At first, it also didn't work.  Then I went into settings and, lo and behold, the folks at Android give you the option to only work at 2.4 GHz.  The app still took a long time to set up the Wi-Fi, but it worked.It would have been even better if the company provided a web portal to set up the Wi-Fi.  This would make it a lot easier to get set up.  For whatever reason, tech companies seem to think that phone apps are more 'hip' and 'now.'  That said, there are still some things that might be easier on a computer...APP OPTIONS:The app is a nice touch, but it's function is limited.  You can turn the device on and off remotely, so if you are coming home you can restart your AC from your car so that when you arrive the house is cool.  You can set mode (Auto, Cool, Dry, etc.), fan speed, the flap movement, and turn on and off the LED lights.You can set an on-off schedule that is different for each day. The system is a little convoluted but once you get the hang of it it is doable.  You can also set the 'sleep curve' to adjust the temperature overnight, after you fall asleep.  This is a little more intuitive, but will not vary from day to day.Again, a web-based interface on a laptop would likely be easier to use than a phone app.Interestingly, Midea appears to make the Toshiba line of Wi-Fi air conditioners.  So if you own both Midea and Toshiba Wi-Fi air conditioners, you can use either the Midea or Toshiba app to connect all of your air conditioners within the same app.ALEXA:Once I set up the Wi-Fi, setting up Alexa was really not a big deal.  The problem with Alexa, for me, was getting Alexa to respond correctly.  First, you have a limited series of commands.  You can turn the unit on, turn it off, and change the temperature.  That's pretty much it.As with many things Alexa, you have to phrase it correctly (e.g. 'Alexa ask my dear air to turn on air conditioner').  Alexa seems to have problems with 'Midea air' (e.g. 'my dear air').  As above, Midea also makes Toshiba's line of air conditioners.  I switched to the Toshiba app because Alexa seems to have fewer problems with the word Toshiba, s o you get a more consistent response to the 'Alexa, ask Toshiba to turn on air conditioner' command. Moreover, with the Toshiba app, you can just say, 'Alexa, turn on Master Bedroom,' and Alexa knows what that means.CONCLUSION:This unit has its ups and downs but actually functions really well as an air conditioner.  Highs include the cooling capacity and the variety of functions.  Lows include noise levels and an app that could use an upgrade (and could be easier to install).  The device is heavy as well, but this is par for the course with this kind of air conditioner.  If I could change one thing about this unit, I would want them to find a way to cut back on the noise.All-in-all, I am satisfied with this device. It performs as well or better than similar, free standing, portable air conditioners and has advanced features.",Jojoleb,4.0,"Excellent cooling capacity, but loud, heavy, and app was difficult to set up  PROS:Effective coolingEasy physical set upSimple to useEasy to use control panelServiceable remoteHose connects firmly and does not disconnectWi-Fi AppAlexa compatibility (with some limitations)CONS:Loud when compressor is activeHeavyVery short drainage hose supplied for dehumidify modeWonky Wi-Fi set up--app set up can only be done with 2.4 GHz Wi-FiLimited control/immature appNo laptop or online interface--app control onlyNeeds to be about a foot away from the wallLouvers swing up and down; no way to direct cool air side to sideOVERVIEWThe Midea portable air conditioner is an effective portable air conditioner.

And perhaps the fact that having multiple sizes of products with different sizes also touting different features may have also confused a lot of the buyers.  It also appears that these problems dog other manufacturers of portable AC units from looking at some other product reviews.  Note that this review is for the largest model in the lineup, which as far as I can tell sports all the available features.First, just know this:  for cooling mode, you can set the fan to low, med, or high, and you can also keep it on constantly so that it doesn't go off and on with the compressor.  And mine was surprisingly quiet even on high - much, much better than AC units at low to mid range hotels.  And it is a very steady noise, no rattling or anything like that, so it probably measures much lower in sones than it does in decibels.  And being able to put it on constant is very important (that feature is not available for all modes, but it is for cooling).Also, on AC mode, you do NOT need a condensate line.  These things somehow use an evaporative technique presumably similar to refrigerators.  And it seems to still remove some humidity from the space, probably just by blowing it out with the hot air.  I know a bit about refrigeration, but I can't say for sure how exactly that is supposed to work.  They do tell you that extra condensate will temporarily accumulate in the bottom of the unit, and in rare, severe cases, you may have to drain it (I don't see that happening often, but I will admit it would be a major pain for most people given the weight of this thing...and since many people would use it in the bedroom, where would you drain it).If you use it in ""dry""/dehumidification mode, you'll have to hook up a continuous drain, and you'd likely want it in your basement.  If you want that, but a dehumidifier for $100 instead.  It's nice that this is multi-purpose, but normally you'd want both at the same time...not like you need dehumidification in the winter most places.Heat pump mode also needs a drain line, so that could get more complicated.You must vent outside for AC, but NOT for dehumidify.  Tube is too large to go out a 4"" dryer vent, but I understand on some smaller models, you could do that.Overall, I am very pleased with this unit.  I put in a whole-house unit a while back, but I need an AC in my attic when I want to do work in there in the summer months (and I recently changed out a window, which has too small of an opening for the old window unit I kept around).  This thing functions for me exactly how I expected, and I also like having it around as a backup or even as extra cooling for sleeping should I ever decide I need it (because my upstairs is still warmer than downstairs since I designed the HVAC for a heating-dominant geographic location).I was particularly pleased with the installation package.  The window plates are thick and rest inside the frame perfectly.  The foam pieces are great if you are going to keep it in one place all summer long.  The duct shrinks down to about 1 foot long.  They also give you a small bracket to ""lock"" the window, although I've noticed this won't work on my ""double-hung"" attic windows (so you may need a contingency plan if your frames already have something on the sides of the top frame...read the manual and figure it out before you buy if you're concerned about this...it's only two screws anyway, but most windows have pretty cheap locks anyway, so not much difference if you can use the locking kit).I've always hated window units more than anything, since they're so wasteful, ugly, and let so much sound from outside into the interior.  I believe this would do just as good of a job as the giant window unit I used to use downstairs, but it would be so much better in so many ways.  And I could even face it inside better than I could before (used a side window because it's just too ugly to put it out the front).  But of course now it takes up some room inside, which is the only drawback.  And it costs more than window units, I think.  But you can move it around as necessary (although I'll tell you dragging it upstairs to downstairs all the time would get quite old).I personally don't use ""smart"" stuff, but it does appear that the app offers a lot of features, and I think only by getting your unit from a big company specializing in AC like Midea can you get such a robust app for an appliance like this.Overall, I'm very impressed.  I think if you can find a good place to put this, and take the time to install it well, you can have a much nicer experience with this than you would with a window unit.

I personally think everyone should have one of these in their homes, however, even if they have central AC - just as a backup, in case your central AC konks out for any reason in the dead of summer - which is exactly what happened to me.Like most other portable ACs, this claims to cool up to 330 sq ft. Note the ""up to"" part. That is a best case scenario, and the reality is that it will most likely not cover anywhere near that amount - at least, not consistently. The closer you are to the unit, the cooler - and there's a small radius around it that stays that way. Unlike a window unit, which has more blowing power and can pull out the humidity/heat faster (and drain out the moisture far more quickly outside), these are weaker, slower, and cannot handle open spaces very well - especially if you have higher ceilings and your floorplan flows into more square footage. They work well, however, in smaller and fully enclosed rooms - or for people who might have a slightly warmer room in one area of their house and they want some extra cooling on top of what they already have in their central AC. These are nice for bedrooms, small studies, and other rooms where you can close the door, etc. - and they're obviously easier to move around and way more subtle than bulky window units sticking out your window outside. They CAN get a space cool, but it needs to be enclosed in a restricted space in order for them to be effective. They're perfect for temporary situations or as a backup to an already working AC. Outside of that, you're going to be really disappointed with any and all portable ones like this one. I don't feel that it's fair to knock off a bunch of stars for it not doing what it wasn't really designed to do in the first place - but just note that these are limited in what they can do. You're paying for the ease and luxury of portability with these if you are trying to figure out whether to get a window unit or a portable one.This one is no exception to that, but it's certainly better than nothing when you're in a pinch and need AC in a limited space, especially if you're not allowed to have a window unit (or don't want to mess with the hassle of one). If you place this in a smaller room with the door closed and blowing reasonably near your bed, for instance, it will get quite cold. I stuck this in a kids' bedroom so they could be comfortable at night while we were waiting to replace a broken compressor on our central AC unit. It works as well as another name brand we purchased from a brick and mortar store that we placed in another room - but this one was significantly more expensive for doing the same thing the other does, which is why I knocked off a star.Installation is fairly straightforward (just read the instructions and make sure your window can accommodate it), and the wheels roll nicely when you are needing to move it to another location (or for storage). You will need to make sure your window is sealed pretty tightly for best results. The noise level (all portable ones I've tried are very noisy) is the same as other brands we've used - such as Hisense, LG, etc. Yep, it's noisy.The remote is simple to use, and it is pretty comparable in every other way to other brands. I prefer the location of the fins on this one over some other ones, but that's just me - and it seems to dehumidify pretty well on the whole for small spaces.

If you place this in a smaller room with the door closed and blowing reasonably near your bed, for instance, it will get quite cold. I stuck this in a kids' bedroom so they could be comfortable at night while we were waiting to replace a broken compressor on our central AC unit. It works as well as another name brand we purchased from a brick and mortar store that we placed in another room - but this one was significantly more expensive for doing the same thing the other does, which is why I knocked off a star.Installation is fairly straightforward (just read the instructions and make sure your window can accommodate it), and the wheels roll nicely when you are needing to move it to another location (or for storage). You will need to make sure your window is sealed pretty tightly for best results. The noise level (all portable ones I've tried are very noisy) is the same as other brands we've used - such as Hisense, LG, etc. Yep, it's noisy.The remote is simple to use, and it is pretty comparable in every other way to other brands. I prefer the location of the fins on this one over some other ones, but that's just me - and it seems to dehumidify pretty well on the whole for small spaces. It honestly works about as well as to be expected, and it keeps my kiddo comfy at night, so I'm decently satisfied with it.As with anything, YMMV depending on what your needs are and what you're looking for."

I tried it but stopped using it because of its sped.-  I did my own little temp check using a meat thermometer, holding it about 4-5in from fan, and here's the results:  -  My old fan, room @ 87 degrees, fan lowered temp to 81/82  -  This fan, room @ 87 degrees, fan with only water in it, lowered temp to 77/78  -  This fan, room @ 87 degrees, fan with water & ice in it, lowered temp to 71/72So it does work, but you need to be close to it to get the feeling it's working for you.

180,180,B0891XSRF2,,25-Jul-20,Verified Purchase,Best Portable AC Fan I've ever had,  I have a work office in the garage and it gets very hot during summer. I have tried many different kinds of portable AC and none of them came close. This fan can be moved anywhere on my desk due to its own battery(which can last a long time) and doesn't need to be plugged in all the time like the other ones i've had. The cooling part is very very consistent as in that blue filter doesn't dry out and the spray from the water tank is really good to keep it moist. I love how i can charge the battery with USB C (faster charge and easier to connect). The lighting part is a big plus as it seems to give me good mood or add color around my boring color office (the others have no lighting at all). I would pick this over all the other portable AC.,Merrill A,5.0,Best Portable AC Fan I've ever had  I have a work office in the garage and it gets very hot during summer.

191,191,B0891XSRF2,,17-Jul-20,Verified Purchase,This portable AC has made my 8 hour shifts working in the factory during this heat wave pleasant.,"  I live in Ohio where the heat has been unbearably in the 90's for going on two weeks now. I work in a factory where if it's hot outside, it's even hotter inside and because of the products we make, we do not have good air conditioner but rely heavily on fans blowing on us. And if anyone knows about running fans in the heat, it's pretty useless because it just blows more heat.  My manager informed us that we can bring in our own fans and so I decided to look into portable air conditioners and most were too large that I would need a window to use it which of course would be impossible.  Then, I saw this small air conditioner that reminded me of something similar I've seen on a TV commercial and the price was much less than what was advertised on TV but because I was curious and comfortable with the price and because I was in dire need of something quickly for work, I decided to give it a try.  I've only had it for about about a week but I was too excited to share my thoughts on this.  I can't express enough my satisfaction of this portable AC and it's power. I was a little skeptic at first because I kept thinking where I stand and work, the way I would have to set it on, would I be able to feel anything. Well, I've had this sitting on a stool about 6 ft away from me and it really does work well. It feels as if I am sitting in front of my own living room AC.  What I do like is that you do not need an plug outlet to use this for you can charge using a usb chord. So you can charge it and it works for about 2 hours depending on the power you use it on. I have it on the 3rd power which is the highest and it does feel good.  But because it does last about 2 hours on a charge on high, I like to have it attached to my extension chord connected to the outlet to a port I have that takes usb.  But if you need to use this on charge without going more than two hours such as being outside, in the car or even in your office with no window. You can use this and it will feel like spring or fall time winds coming at you. Feels good and it gives me a sense of comfort as I am working in the hot factory.  Now, be sure to have water available because you will need to fill the top with water which is what provides that cool air and what I do is, I put ice cubes in it for that extra burst of cool air but any temp water will do since it's the fans blowing out the air.  Comes with different options of power from a low cool to a high cool and like I said before, because it's portable, you can use this anywhere. I also use this at home when I am asleep which this offers a cool feature that the top lights up with several colors using a built in led light which makes it nice to sleep with , especially with my infant baby sleeping in bed with me. You can adjust the fan shutter from blowing the air directly on you to moving it up to maybe push the heat up away from you.  It's super quiet and it really doesn't take long to cool off, I say it is almost immediately how fast it cools me off at work.  It comes with a strap where you can easily carry it anywhere and you can sit it on anything from the grassy yards when enjoying the night starts, to my coffee table while watching tv.  I can attest that is a great product and I am very pleased with this purchase.

I think it's important for people to understanding what they are getting and not expect this to be comparable to an ACTUAL AC unit.

It puts out a lot more air flow then I was expecting, and is super quiet. The only things that keep it from being WOW out of this world 5 star is the ability to tilt it up or down and if the water reservoir was a bit more insulated.

This is very portable easy to use AC and I simply have to refill it with water every day after using it extended periods during the mornings and afternoons. The controls on its front are very well designed and its overall base which is used as its grip to hold is also firm enough to hold it easily without any issues and same way its wider round base is also more than enough to place it firmly on a solid surface like my Patio table and living room table. I use this mist fan at medium speed most of the times and there is little to no noise at all during its extended usage. The front cover of the fan is safe and there is no risk of my fingers accidentally touching the blades inside the fan so safety aspect is good. There is also a timer mode of 4 hours and 2 hours and I have kept the 2 hour mode On by default unless I manually turn it off before that so that feature is also handy.2 Bonus features which i did not anticipate earlier but after using this product I loved were:A) The fan when using at night time displays the wonderful 7 different colors of my choosing and if I am using it outside while chilling at my patio, it feels so refreshing at night when viewing those colors on the circular disk of the front of the fan and at the same time receiving cool mist from it in hot and humid climate.B) 3 sepearate buttons for Wind/Cool/Light so I do not have to do multiple presses on single button to change the settings or any effort in that direction. Plain simple whatever setting I need, I simply press that button on the fan and it provides me and that is all I want in hot temperatures around this time of the year.EXPERIMENT:I experimented twice by adding the cologne I have with water and ice inside the fan's tank and the mist indeed brought out so tempting fragrance outside and filled the entire surrounding area near it with this fragrance. I have since then mixed 2 different colognes I have with water and ice and used them in late evening time when simply relaxing on my patio and it felt good.For its cost, it is a good deal and savior of both my electricity bill as well as myself from the currently hot temperatures nearing almost 95 Degrees daily.",Pragnesh Desai,5.0,"Parallel way to save electricity when I alone need cool air  Ordered this portable AC to use it when I alone need air conditioned cold air when located in certain area of my home as my home has central AC and for me alone, if I turned on my AC, it consumed lot of electricity.

Liking the different modes of ventilation direction, speeds, and fan power. I haven't been this comfortable in months, (due to the fact that my apt building doesnt allow window mounted AC units) and this is an effective alternative! Added ice into the tank, now running at 69F 🙌🏼 Delivery was WAY faster than quoted! Product was packed securely too! Thanks so much!!!",Amazon Customer,5.0,"Very effective! Recommend!

574,574,B089KQWY4V,,31-Jul-20,Verified Purchase,Absolutely unacceptable!!!!!!!!,"  Unit arrived in a perfect box, no damage. Unit inside was dead on arrival and sounded like the entire fan fell apart when I turned it on, plastic bits spewing behind the fan cover and rattling around. I contacted for a return, I was sent a shipping label for which I needed to pay to return the unit. I was told by Amazon to return the product and contact them back to be reimbursed. It cost me $115.30 in shipping to return a DOA product that cost me $180 for the initial purchase.

I needed an alternative to using the central AC all day while I've been working from home during COVID and this works perfectly.  I intended to only use it in my home office during the day but I liked it so much I use it in my bedroom at night.  It's portable and light enough for me to move by myself plus it's quiet enough and the sound helps me to sleep.  It's easy to use, I just fill it with ice and water and set it to cool and choose the swing back and forth function and I stay cool.  The remote is a definite plus.",Monica,5.0,"Keeps me Cool  I am very happy with my purchase.

579,579,B089KQWY4V,,29-Jul-20,Verified Purchase,"Cool, cool, cool Cooler","  I live in coastal South Carolina and bought this evaporative cooler for a room that faces south. Despite the room being connected to our home's central AC system, the room has been practically unusable  due to its having windows on 3 sides that gets sun all day. Winter or summer, if the sun is out, the room is uncomfortably hot. If you are familiar with personal size swamp coolers, this works much the same way, but on a grander scale. Unlike a regular fan that circulates whatever air is already in a room, thiswell-designed unit will blow out really cool to cold air within a sizeable area. My room is 168 sq ft (the specs say it is good for cooling a room up to 200 sq ft), but the cooler does not cool the WHOLE room...but rather makes the AREA of the room where I place the cooler....cool and comfortable. If you have reasonable expectations of the device's capabilities, you will LOVE this product. I love this product. I keep it at a lower setting, as it can be a bit loud... a fair trade off, I think, for the benefits it provides. The machine is attractive, easy to use, with many options for operating. The remote control is an added bonus. It arrived sooner than expected and was VERY well packaged. I hope to have use of it for years!

591,591,B089KQWY4V,,14-Jul-20,Verified Purchase,True Evaporative Cooler - Good for Small Rooms,"  I've been using this cooler daily now that Texas heat has reached 105 and over some days. My house has basic evaporative cooling so our rooms heat up a lot at night making it uncomfortable to sleep with just a fan. I decided to buy this unit because the price point is affordable and it has a somewhat larger tank so filling it up and using it throughout the night isn't a problem. The capacity for the water tank is fairly large so I was able to fill it to almost the fill line then add ice. I recommend you add ice for best results as the a/c has a fan function as well as a cooling function and the best option is definitely the cooling function.The a/c unit does have a couple of cool features - notably you can pick what ""wind"" style you want which is you can have the fan wax and wane while controlling the motion of the blades like a typical old school fan. I like to leave mine on a fixed setting because it feels best to cool down a room. The a/c is also very easily portable, it's not too heavy and has wheels on it to make taking it to other areas very fast and easy.The biggest plus is the remote - I don't have to get up from my bed to control the unit and I can easily switch between modes effortlessly with the tap of the button - which includes turning off the cooling function, controlling the swing and speed of the fan blades and simply turning my a/c off and on.My two biggest cons and what makes me give this item 4 stars is that 1: the unit isn't quiet - you do get used to it but there is definitely a loudness to it and 2. the size - like most portable a/c units, this one is on the larger size so if you are in a small space, this can definitely take up a lot of room. Right now it does just that so it feels a little bulky.Overall, still happy with item and appreciate that it's helping me beat this summer heatwave.",K.,4.0,"True Evaporative Cooler - Good for Small Rooms  I've been using this cooler daily now that Texas heat has reached 105 and over some days.
