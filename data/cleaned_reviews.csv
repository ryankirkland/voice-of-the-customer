0,B08267BBJT,AAA,2020-08-11,Verified Purchase,"Didn't work, then worked, now don't work again"," All I got in terms of use out of these batteries were about three days of use out of two of them and have had no additional success. I bought them because I was bleeding through AAA batteries and was hoping the compact design would be better than something more bulky.Right out of the box, I charged them until the light was green indicating they were fully charged, tried to use them in a couple of devices and didn't have any luck. I was going to return them, but my friend suggested I switch from charging in an extension cord to directly in a wall socket. I thought that it did the trick, even though I thought that was silly, when I tried the batteries in a device after letting them charge overnight plugged directly into the wall socket, they did work, and worked well.About three days later, the device stopped working in the middle of high powered usage (hair trimmers). I swapped the batteries I had in there for the other two that had been charging the entire time, and they didn't work. I went out and bought regular AAA batteries and the device went back to working just fine. I tried the batteries in a few other devices and they aren't working. It seems they work just enough to convince you they work, then stop working.I don't often leave feedback on products, but I felt it was important to say here that I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries.

50,B079JFK22D,AA,2020-06-27,Verified Purchase,"Works well, but understand what you're getting."," These are novel and strange batteries. It's super convenient to recharge via USB chargers (which are ubiquitous these days). It'd be nice if they came with a 4-way cable to permit charging all cells off one suitable USB charger. These are excellent when you have a device that's really meant for cells like alkaline or lithium primary cells that put out a full 1.5V. Sometimes such a device won't work as well from 1.2V rechargables like NiMH or NiCad. These cells will work better, but you'll need to be aware of key downsides:1) Because they output a full 1.5V steadily until fully discharged, there's no voltage dip for electronic gadgets to use to gauge battery charge remaining. So your device will appear fully-charged on these batteries 100% till cutout, which will be sudden and unexpected. Have a backup set ready!2) Because of (1), these cells are a little risky when used to power devices like digital recorders and cameras. They'll work, but because of the sudden cut-out when discharged, if you fail to stop your recording in the normal way beforehand, you may lose the /entire/ recording due to failure to write-out and close the recording file to the flash memory normally. For a still camera, this'll be just the last picture at cut-out, but for an audio or video recording, you might lose the whole recording. The risk can be minimized by timing the runtime in the device you get from the cells in a test-run first, then being careful to stop using the device in the field in sufficient time to save and close your recording before that time (being sure to adjust for extreme temperatures, which reduce capacity).3) These batteries work by using a micro-mini voltage convertor to step the cell's native 3.6V (4.2V - 3.0V) down to a fixed 1.5V output. A side effect of the convertor's operation is stray radio-frequency emission, some of which is conducted thru into the device being powered. If that device is a radio receiver, like a handheld scanner or FRS/GMRS handy-talkie, or similar, you can expect reduced receive performance.In testing with a handheld scanner I use to monitor operations at my local airport, I experienced a 50% reduction of sensitivity, and some low frequencies (e.g. the AM broadcast band) were lost in the RF noise from these cells entirely. This isn't a defect, it's just a side-effect of how the cells work. A battery-powered GPS device may also be affected, I tried them in a Garmin GPSmap 60CS 2-AA handheld GPS unit. They worked flawlessly for me here, with no reduction in satellite signal strength, but your device may vary and you could try it out first before going into the field. And again, there will be no warning prior to end-of-discharge cut-off, the GPS will appear ""fully charged"" the entire time.So what do I use them for? I have an LED flashlight that's super bright, but was designed for alkaline cells and would not get to full brightness on normal NiMH rechargeables. These cells work _perfectly_ there. The only remaining downside is limited cell capacity. From 2400 mAh NiMH cells, I'd get two hours continuous runtime, but these cells can only provide one hour (1200 mAh capacity). Again, that's simply a side effect of the design and isn't a defect.I also have a couple of fancy electronic flash units for my SLR camera, and these cells work extremely well in that device too!So, know your device and your application to decide if these cells are right for you. Most modern electronic gadgets like radio equipment or digital recording devices will be designed to operate just fine from 1.2V NiMH cells, and these won't harm the receive performance of a radio like these USB cells. Plus, you'll get proper charge-state indications from NiMH cells. Just remember to select and pack a quality NiMH charger in that case.",Andrew Skretvedt,4.0,6,2020,2020-06,"Works well, but understand what you're getting. These are novel and strange batteries.

98,B079JFK22D,AA,2020-03-10,Verified Purchase,Convenient and long lasting," I had purchased a large pack of regular lithium batteries for my Blink cameras and Kwikset Smart Locks, so I would have extras on hand. The batteries last so much longer than standard batteries, so I decided to look into rechargeable lithium batteries.I bought this 4-pack a a test. I like that you just pop the cap off and stick them in a USB to charge. It takes about 90 minutes to fully charge the batteries. The red light is on during charge and off when done. No looking around for the charging equipment either, which is incredibly convenient.I put these batteries into a new Kwikset Smart Lock I had just installed.

141,B079JFK22D,AA,2020-01-02,Verified Purchase,As fragile as an egg shell," I purchased a couple sets of these as an alternative to purpose-built rechargeable battery packs for Xbox One controllers. While I was initially pleased with the purchase, that pleasure unraveled in short order.The Good:The little rechargeable batteries feature a nifty ""flip cap"" design, exposing a standard-issue USB-A male connector (think: the tried and true USB connection type for desktop computers and wall chargers). They charge relatively quickly, and fit perfectly well in anything that accepts AA batteries.The Bad:TL;DR: they break. Very. Easily. The USB connector (not the battery top-style cap) breaks with very little provocation. On top of that, the actual innards of the lithium battery also come out of the metallic ""battery"" housing without much effort as well (say, when removing the battery from the port in which it's charging). Out of eight batteries (two 4-packs), only about three remain intact at the time of this review. While I admittedly did not got out of my way to be extra gentle (and, to be fair, I didn't see the need to be), I also did not physically punish these items to the extent that their current condition would suggest. I've handled plenty of similar-sized USB devices from thumb drives, to Bluetooth/WiFi and more, and have not experienced this level of degradation before.Conclusion:I believe this product to be a case of good idea/poor implementation. The convenience of having AA shaped/sized rechargeable batteries which do not require a specialized charger is delightful, but the elation there only lasts as long as these batteries (read: not long at all). I have since broken down and purchased charging stands with battery packs for my controllers, and that seems to be working out a good deal better.

Unlike most rechargeable batteries, these give off a full 1.5v (instead of 1.2v which many other rechargeables do) and the fact I do not need another charger (it's built into the battery) just make these the best rechargeables I've owned so far. As far as battery life goes, they surpass the Quest's own battery life even after heavy Beat Saber sessions (and yes, putting sabers into the fields so the drain is even harder).They may be pricy at $20 for 4, but if you hate swapping batteries and keep losing the chargers, pair these up with a USB multi-charger and you have a match made in heaven.

Unlike most rechargeable batteries, these give off a full 1.5v (instead of 1.2v which many other rechargeables do) and the fact I do not need another charger (it's built into the battery) just make these the best rechargeables I've owned so far. As far as battery life goes, they surpass the Quest's own battery life even after heavy Beat Saber sessions (and yes, putting sabers into the fields so the drain is even harder).They may be pricy at $20 for 4, but if you hate swapping batteries and keep losing the chargers, pair these up with a USB multi-charger and you have a match made in heaven.

I can't yet speak about the longevity of the product, having owned them for only a few months and recharging them barely a handful of cycles. What I can say is that they don't have much of a charge and they don't hold a charge well at all.I bought these to power my son's Kodak Pixpro FZ43. Now I must qualify my review by admitting that I don't know anything about batteries or the power consumption of the camera. I am primarily interested in usability. Having said that I can only attest that the batteries last for about 40 photos before the camera shuts down after claiming the batteries are low. These are photos taken outside during daylight hours with no flash, with the camera remaining on between snaps and also using functions like the grid and telephoto. In other words, neither my son or myself were very much impressed.Another criticism is that the charged batteries have a very short shelf life. I charged all four batteries after my son's last picture taking session and we didn't need them again for about three weeks. When we attempted to use the batteries in the camera again we removed two of them from the protective case they came in and installed them in the camera. The camera wouldn't even begin to power up, indicating the batteries were completely dead. Of course, I checked to make sure the batteries were installed correctly and they were. I tried the second set of two batteries with the same results. After an hour and a half of charging time the batteries powered up the camera and were again good for around 40 shots or so.I can't recommend this brand of batteries.

521,B085HB8QVX,AA,2020-08-06,Not Verified,nice batteries; charge cables are inefficient," I’ve used lots of rechargeable batteries over the years, including NiCad and NiMH batteries.  But I’ve started shifting to rechargeable lithium batteries because they hold a charge a lot longer than other rechargeable types can, especially when not in use for a long time.  They also tend not to develop a “memory” when charged frequently.This particular AA rechargeable battery set includes four AA lithium batteries, a plastic battery storage case, and two magnetic charge cables.  This set does not come with an AC-USB adapter.The magnetic charge cables are pretty interesting, although somewhat limited in utility.  Each cable has two heads, and each one magnetically attaches to the positive end of a battery and charges by USB.  The downside is it can only charge two batteries at a time, so you have to use both cables and tie up two separate USB ports to charge the four batteries.  The cables are also very short, so this method of charging is only useful if you’re charging them very close to a computer or USB charging hub.  This is not very efficient at all, although it may be a good solution for someone who travels and doesn’t want to lug around a typical box charger.  While charging, each magnetic head gives off a blue light that turns green when charging is complete.  It took several hours to fully charge the batteries.  Once charged, though, they work great in any device using AA batteries.Overall, this is a nice set of rechargeable batteries.  It’s an expensive set, but when you consider the cost of AA alkaline batteries these days, it should save a lot of money down the road, especially when used in battery hogs like toys, flashlights, and camera flash attachments.",Terry R.

For some reason one battery’s light took several hours longer than the others to turn green, but they are all charged now. I love having small, portable USB charging cords instead of a big, bulky charger that you have to plug into the wall.",0.43674242424242427,0.0891528925619835,Positive

602,B07Y475MD3,9V,2020-04-05,Verified Purchase,Pretty impressed so far but incorrectly said it was charged.," This set comes with an USB charger that separates into two wires so you can charge both batteries at the same time from one port. It's a nice flat tape like one, instead of the typical round cord. I was pleasantly surprised by that. So I start charging my batteries and probably somewhere around 3 hours later one of the batteries green light finally turns on and I disconnect it although the other is still red/charging. I put it in the flashlight I wanted to use it in but it didn't work... I actually thought the flashlight was broken at first.

The thing about blink camera battery life is that they say it gives you two years on a set of batteries but realistically you’re lucky to get 2 to 7 days. Now I’ve had that limitation on longevity with the regular batteries and I have it even more so with these.

I like that they don't require a custom charger, just a standard USB cable.The only caveat with this type of battery is they don't work well in portable radios because the built-in voltage regulator puts out wide spectrum radio interference which overloads the radio's sensitive tuner.

704,B07R2KK5P7,AA,2019-09-17,Verified Purchase,Capacity Test and Technical Review," Fuvaly 1.5v Lithium AA 4x Rechargeable Batteries SummaryPros:* Lights are helpful* Very lightweight* 1.6v unloaded output voltage is great; 1.55v or higher, consistent and based on load* Stays coolCons:* Tested when new to 82.5% of stated capacity (1.857 Wh instead of 2.25 Wh), a little low but in the expected range* Almost no warning when out of power. Cannot be used in critical devices where power cannot be lost.* More expensive than 1.2v NiMHBackgroundMy intended use for these is for wireless Xbox controllers (2 AA) and wireless Oculus touch controllers (1 AA).I have been using high capacity rechargeable NMHi 1.2v AA batteries for a couple years in the XBox controllers. I've tried two models, a 2800mah kind and 2500 mah turnigy brand, marked as low self-discharge.I tested the capacity of these NmHi batteries which were good, however my xbox never showed a full battery, even when freshly recharged, and it would warn for some time that the battery was low. It was good to get the warning and have more use before having to swap them (days of use), but I felt I never got enough life out of these batteries. The 2500 mah Turnigy brand seemed to last longer than the larger capacity ones because they seemed to hold a high voltage. In the oculus it was the same, where some fresh batteries were immediately detected as low.It is true that alkaline batteries start at 1.5v but quickly drop voltage and spend more of their life at 1.3v and 1.2v, and that is why rechargeables match that voltage, but I wanted to try a battery that sustained a higher voltage and see if they provided more ""usable"" power.I chose these Fuvaly because they were the ONLY AA Lithium on amazon who posted details such as discharge rates. I saw these are not a good fit for high discharge rate devices such as camera flashes and some toys like RC vehicles. Having an indicator light and a charge port are superior to batteries where one must remove and replace batteries to reset them and there is no indicator that says what the battery is doing (on or off or charging).Capacity TestI performed a discharge test on standard 4 button charger of a single cell using 0.4a discharge rate, which should last two or three hours. I was happy to see the voltage was a high and consistent based on load for the duration of the test. 1.56v for 0.4a. After it shut off, I let it settle a little and tried to get more out but there was nothing left.I got a total 1.857 Wh of energy out. This is 82.5% of the reported 2.25 Wh capacity. Instead of the reported 1500 mah at 1.5v, I got 1238 mah.This is an expected result due to efficiency loss of the step down conversion, and use of cheap components. I did expect a little better efficiency because the battery must have a 3.7v nominal voltage and output requires only a step down (not a boost converter). Also I did not feel any heat during discharge; that means little loss to heat and it is likely the underlying battery capacity less than 2.25 Wh.I did not test the maximum discharge rate.The good news is the unloaded voltage targets 1.6v, not 1.5v; the voltage dips relative to the load and stays consistent. This means under load the voltage is well above 1.5v. Providing power at a high voltage helps with efficiency.When power runs out on a single cell, the voltage drops to about 1.2v for only 10 seconds or so before completely shutting off. This means electronics get almost no warning when they are out of battery, and the battery and the device will shut off with almost no warning compared to 1.2v NmHi rechargeables. This is compounded when using two or more of these in the same device; the device will be shut off when any one battery is drained. Do not use these batteries in critical devices such as a transmitter for radio controlled aircraft; they will shut off without warning.Charges at 0.36a at 5v, or 1.8 Watts.I did not open the cell but I suspect it is a 1S 600mah Lithium ion polymer battery.  These typically discharge at 5% a month and have a charge shelf life of 300 days.For the best care, do not leave the batteries at a low state; charge them immediately if drained. For slightly longer life, if you are storing them, they are better stored at 35% to 55% capacity or so (50%), not at a full charge. However if you charge them, they will lose 5% a month so it's a good compromise between being ready and storage voltage.Do not charge lithium batteries unattended; use a fire-safe surface such as granite counter top or cement floor; if they become very hot to the touch during charging or discharging, remove them. Recycle them at batteries plus or other store.I will revise my review after more use in devices.Recommendations:* To those who designed and created this: thank you for sharing detailed specifications. Thank you for the lights and physical design and on off behavior.* More capacity would always be welcomed.* These batteries would be perfect if you changed the circuit programming to provide a longer warning voltage time period when the battery is nearly drained. -- Especially under lower loads, there should be 5 or 10 minutes of warning, say at 1.22v. Under moderate loads, there should be a minimum 2 minute warning low voltage. I would prefer this to be longer so that as the battery ages, and gets worse, the warning system would still be ample. This would make the battery more usable as it ages, even as the capacity shrinks.",Andrew Ackerman,4.0,9,2019,2019-09,"Capacity Test and Technical Review Fuvaly 1.5v Lithium AA 4x Rechargeable Batteries SummaryPros:* Lights are helpful* Very lightweight* 1.6v unloaded output voltage is great; 1.55v or higher, consistent and based on load* Stays coolCons:* Tested when new to 82.5% of stated capacity (1.857 Wh instead of 2.25 Wh), a little low but in the expected range* Almost no warning when out of power. Cannot be used in critical devices where power cannot be lost.* More expensive than 1.2v NiMHBackgroundMy intended use for these is for wireless Xbox controllers (2 AA) and wireless Oculus touch controllers (1 AA).I have been using high capacity rechargeable NMHi 1.2v AA batteries for a couple years in the XBox controllers. I've tried two models, a 2800mah kind and 2500 mah turnigy brand, marked as low self-discharge.I tested the capacity of these NmHi batteries which were good, however my xbox never showed a full battery, even when freshly recharged, and it would warn for some time that the battery was low. It was good to get the warning and have more use before having to swap them (days of use), but I felt I never got enough life out of these batteries. The 2500 mah Turnigy brand seemed to last longer than the larger capacity ones because they seemed to hold a high voltage. In the oculus it was the same, where some fresh batteries were immediately detected as low.It is true that alkaline batteries start at 1.5v but quickly drop voltage and spend more of their life at 1.3v and 1.2v, and that is why rechargeables match that voltage, but I wanted to try a battery that sustained a higher voltage and see if they provided more ""usable"" power.I chose these Fuvaly because they were the ONLY AA Lithium on amazon who posted details such as discharge rates. I saw these are not a good fit for high discharge rate devices such as camera flashes and some toys like RC vehicles. Having an indicator light and a charge port are superior to batteries where one must remove and replace batteries to reset them and there is no indicator that says what the battery is doing (on or off or charging).Capacity TestI performed a discharge test on standard 4 button charger of a single cell using 0.4a discharge rate, which should last two or three hours. I was happy to see the voltage was a high and consistent based on load for the duration of the test. 1.56v for 0.4a. After it shut off, I let it settle a little and tried to get more out but there was nothing left.I got a total 1.857 Wh of energy out. This is 82.5% of the reported 2.25 Wh capacity. Instead of the reported 1500 mah at 1.5v, I got 1238 mah.This is an expected result due to efficiency loss of the step down conversion, and use of cheap components. I did expect a little better efficiency because the battery must have a 3.7v nominal voltage and output requires only a step down (not a boost converter). Also I did not feel any heat during discharge; that means little loss to heat and it is likely the underlying battery capacity less than 2.25 Wh.I did not test the maximum discharge rate.The good news is the unloaded voltage targets 1.6v, not 1.5v; the voltage dips relative to the load and stays consistent. This means under load the voltage is well above 1.5v. Providing power at a high voltage helps with efficiency.When power runs out on a single cell, the voltage drops to about 1.2v for only 10 seconds or so before completely shutting off. This means electronics get almost no warning when they are out of battery, and the battery and the device will shut off with almost no warning compared to 1.2v NmHi rechargeables. This is compounded when using two or more of these in the same device; the device will be shut off when any one battery is drained. Do not use these batteries in critical devices such as a transmitter for radio controlled aircraft; they will shut off without warning.Charges at 0.36a at 5v, or 1.8 Watts.I did not open the cell but I suspect it is a 1S 600mah Lithium ion polymer battery.  These typically discharge at 5% a month and have a charge shelf life of 300 days.For the best care, do not leave the batteries at a low state; charge them immediately if drained. For slightly longer life, if you are storing them, they are better stored at 35% to 55% capacity or so (50%), not at a full charge. However if you charge them, they will lose 5% a month so it's a good compromise between being ready and storage voltage.Do not charge lithium batteries unattended; use a fire-safe surface such as granite counter top or cement floor; if they become very hot to the touch during charging or discharging, remove them.

It is a better application for NMH battery types. But falling from 1.26V to 1V is still too fast. So, alkaline AAA 'lasts' at least 50% longer than NMH, even if same Ampere-hour rating.2.

It is a better application for NMH battery types. But falling from 1.26V to 1V is still too fast. So, alkaline AAA 'lasts' at least 50% longer than NMH, even if same Ampere-hour rating.2. Include hydra charge cable (1-to-4 micro-USB cable)3. Inside the AAA is also charge-control/protection circuit. Can safely charge with ubiquitous micro-USB 5V cellphone charger.4. Max discharge current limits to 1A by electronic circuit, for longevity of its poly-Lithium battery.",0.45200298438934805,0.1107724977043159,Positive

754,B085FZFVQV,AA,2020-07-25,Verified Purchase,Even better than advertised,"  So far I've been very impressed by these batteries. Shipping was fast, packaging is good. I tried out both the magnetic charging and the 5V standard charger. The listing says that the magnetic charger will charge in about an hour and a half. The first battery was complete in about an hour and the second right under 1.5 hours. The two I put on the standard charger were done in about 2 hours. The lighting system for the batteries is really easy to understand, although a bit inconsistent; the magnetic charger is blue during charging and green when charged while the standard charger has a red light with flashing blue during charging and a solid green when charged. Still easy to understand though. Haven't had a lot of time to test these batteries out. I have a high powered LED flashlight that burns through batteries pretty quickly and have it on continuously just to see how long they'll last. So far they're going surprisingly long. This set didn't come with the AC plug - would be nice to see that as an option in the past, but I had a multi-USB charge adapter that worked fine with these and probably most people do as well.",Ben Montgomery,5.0,7,2020,2020-07,"Even better than advertised  So far I've been very impressed by these batteries.

836,B07F27PK2M,AA,2020-01-04,Verified Purchase,They haven't refined the circuitry enough- devices won't always accept them," For those of you that don't know how this works, lithium batteries have a ~3.5 volt nominal charge depending on type and a much greater variance in voltage between charged and discharged states. In order for them to work in place of a 1.5 volt alkaline AA battery, they have to have an onboard voltage regulator to convert the voltage as well as control the USB charging functionality as lithium chemistry needs safety monitoring when charging. This presents several issues. Firstly your device sees the battery at a constant 1.5 volt charge, which makes it think that the batteries are full the entire charge cycle until the onboard converter cuts out on minimum safety (yet another quirk with lithium, they are unsafe to charge ever again if they drop below a minimum safe voltage) and your device goes dead without warning. The second issue is that I am fairly certain the converter goes into a sleep state when it doesn't recognize a load so that it doesn't waste power. This presents an issue for a lot of more intelligent devices that go through a rapid self test when you turn them on. In the case of my old Pentax DSLR it registers that the battery is dead, the indicator flashes and refuses to boot when you turn it on. I have tested all batteries involved with a volt meter, everything registers as a near perfect 1.5 V but their onboard circuitry clashes with the check in my device. The lesson is if you buy these you cannot take for granted that they will work in anything you have. It will actually have very mixed results.",WRPSD,2.0,1,2020,2020-01,"They haven't refined the circuitry enough- devices won't always accept them For those of you that don't know how this works, lithium batteries have a ~3.5 volt nominal charge depending on type and a much greater variance in voltage between charged and discharged states.

I was pretty excited for these when I saw them. In the past you had rechargeable AA’s but they where only 1.2v and not very high capacity.  Then lithium came along, but they where all 3.7 volt. You could make that work on some things using a blank “dummy” battery but the voltages still weren’t right and if your device takes 6 batteries there’s no way to get the voltage close using dummy batteries with those..  but then these batteries can along and solved all those problems. My main use for them is in my hands free stainless garbage can. It has a motion sensor and opens when your hand is near it and runs on 6 AA batteries. I would go through batteries every 1.5 months and it seemed like a real waste to me. The new EBL Lithium rechargeable batteries lasted 1 month and 10 days before needing recharged, so maybe a week less than conventional alkaline batteries. The one big difference I noticed though was these batteries worked strong right up to the point they were dead and could no longer open the lid.  Alkaline batteries lasted slightly longer, but with degraded operation for the last week or so which gave plenty of warning the batteries where going dead. I assume this has to do with the internal circuitry that protects the batteries from voltage dropping too low.  The best part is when the batteries go dead they charge up in an hour or two (not sure exactly as I walked out of the room).

I’m going to scrutinize these with my multimeter to see how they hold up.The first thing I did upon receiving this package was test the voltage of all the batteries.  They were all very near 1.49V.  I then put them on the charger, and it took approximately 95 minutes to achieve a full charge so I know they didn’t have much juice originally.  These batteries are consistently showing a voltage very close to 1.49V.  I’ve included a photo of my multimeter reading 1.491V and the average voltage I’m reading across all four batteries is 1.493V.  Fortunately, there’s no discernible difference between these batteries at a full charge, or at a low charge.  Whereas an alkaline battery will start with 1.5-1.6V and the voltage gradually diminishes, this one seems to run at 100% voltage up until the end of its life.  I’m very happy with my initial tests on these batteries.  The output voltage is constant and essentially perfect at damn near exactly 1.5V, far better than a 1.2V NIMH rechargeable battery. I even had one read exactly 1.5V (pictured).As others here have pointed out most AA battery brands advertise their life in milliamp hours, but this advertises itself in milliwatt hours.  So the 3300 mWh converts to 2200 mAh.  (3300 mWh / 1.5V = 2200 mAh)  This isn’t a problem with the battery per se, just the marketing.I purchased these a bit experimentally.  I’m an electrician.  After burning up a few too many AAs and AAAs on some of my less-powerful battery operated tools, I’ve been looking into getting rechargeables.  I was primarily intrigued by the high capacity, the constant voltage, and the quick and easy recharge of these.  I also needed to be able to recharge these quickly with or without access to power, as I can do courtesy of my Makita ADP05 (pictured).  Between the constant (and correct) voltage, high energy capacity, fast recharge, and convenient USB charger, my first impression of these is very positive.

Normal, non-rechargeable AA batteries put out 1.5 volts.  For some reason that I’ve never understood rechargeable batteries, whether they’re NiCad, NiMh, and even the ultra popular Enloops only put out 1.2 volts.  Now most devices are designed to operate on less voltage than the combined total of the batteries they take, but not all of them.  The ones that are actually expecting the full voltage tend to react either by drawing more current from the batteries to compensate and making the rechargeable batteries last half as long, or malfunctioning in a variety of ways.  The Blackube rechargeables are the first I’ve ever used that actually put out the same 1.5 volts as a standard AA.The full voltage aspect is probably these can’t be recharged with a normal AA battery charger.  They have a micro USB port instead.  This has the advantage that you done actually need a separate device to charge them.  The 4-pack comes with a 4-way charging cable, however the carrying case only has room for the batteries not the cable, so it might be easy to accidentally separate them.  If you lose the cable, you can still use any old micro USB cable to charge them, but only one battery per cable at a time.The capacity on these is really impressive.

If you lose the cable, you can still use any old micro USB cable to charge them, but only one battery per cable at a time.The capacity on these is really impressive.  I’ve been using a pair in my XBONE controller and after 12 hours of play time they still show as 100% charged.These are by far my favorite rechargeables because they’re compatible with devices that are traditionally not compatible with rechargeables (because of the goofy 1.2V vs 1.5V thing), they recharge very quickly on a quick charger circuit and they have an amazing amount of capacity.",0.5522222222222221,0.21041666666666664,Positive

They take a long time to charge and they slowly fade away. Not great for devices that use 3 batteries. Or something that you need to supply with a constant high power. I bought a bunch of these for use in under cabinet lighting, and aquarium gravel vac, and my wireless weather station. The under cabinet lighting, just sucks batteries dry. And these are no different, in fact in that application they don't last nearly as long as alkaline or NiMH. But they do stay brighter longer. The gravel vac is the same situation. The fade of power made it frustrating to use. These are constant. Full suction all the time. If they do die, there's just no suction at all. It's a very clear indicator. And charging doesn't take 8 hours. plug these into a USB port and they are good in an hour or two. Finally, the weather station. It seems like those batteries are always freezing and dying or over heating and dying. These are less sensitive to temperature swings. And recharging 3 of these batteries is so much easier. I don't have to cycle them through the charger like I would the NiMHs. NiMHs don't like it when you pair a dead battery with a fully charged one. These don't care. You can charge 1 or 3 no problem.I'd love to see a longer run time but the charging convenience and steady power more than make up for their weaknesses.One thing I would really love to see is a double length battery.

I use the same 5v 1A power supply that came with my phone.Neutral, but important:-provides a constant 1.5v supply. I think this results in inaccurate remaining capacity readings. My voice recorder determines the battery's remaining capacity by looking at its voltage, and since the voltage stays at a constant 1.5v even right before they die, the battery icon will always show a full charge even when it's just about to die.

1462,B07MWYYDTM,Other,2019-06-02,Verified Purchase,Good 1.5V batteries for voltage picky devices," I have been wanting to get something like these for a while and they work great for my use case. You may ask, why would anyone pay $10 for a single AA cell? Why wouldn't you just get a cheaper NiMH cell and call it a day? The answer to this is simple: There are devices I own that are just not designed to operate at lower voltages. When I go on business trips, two things really matter to me -- my portable water flosser and my wireless mouse for my laptop. Problem with NiMH is that while it is fully charged at 1.5V, their voltages quickly drop down to the 1.25-1.3V range soon after they are being used or have been sitting around for a while. This means a much weaker pressure on my water flosser and a choppy Bluetooth connection for my wireless mouse. Charging my NiMHs every so often has gotten to be such a chore that I have decided I would pay up for these cells instead which can keep a consistent voltage over time.Although the concept of lithium-ion USB AA cells is not new (there are plenty out of products out there), this is one of the highest rated capacities that can be found on Amazon. All of these cells work by enclosing a lithium-based battery inside an AA enclosure and using a small chip built into the + terminal of the battery to convert and regulate the output voltage. The circuit also regulates charging and the discharging of the built-in lithium battery to prevent over(dis)charging.Here are my thoughts on these batteries:Style/Design: These look exactly like your traditional AA batteries, with the exception that there is a built-in micro USB port on top of each battery (as opposed to other designs that have this on the side). The battery seems sturdy and in one piece. It does not appear that it would suffer from the drop issue that other designs face with the circuitry falling off when dropped. There is also a charging indicator light that turns red when the battery is being charged and turns off when the charging is complete. The enclosed 4-in-1 cable is quite handy so you can simply use one cable to charge 4 batteries at once without having to use a USB hub or 4 separate cables.Weight: Since lithium-based batteries have higher energy densities, the battery is significantly lighter when compared to a 2,400mAh LSD NiMH. One of these cells weighed 20g while the NiMH based cell weighed 29g.Voltage Stability Under Load: When the batteries are not subject to a load, they measure around 1.51-1.53V. When placed under load, the voltage drops are as follows:250mA: 1.46V500mA: 1.41V750mA: 1.38V1A: 1.34V1.25A: 1.30V1.5A: 1.24V1.75A: 1.22V2A: 1.20V2.15A: 1.18VBeyond ~2.2A, the current limiter kicks in and no further increase in current is possible, even in the case of a short circuit. When measured with a multimeter under a short-circuit condition, the maximum acquired current was 2.21A. I am not quite sure how the manufacturer was able to achieve 4A of current on these cells, but it is possible that they were testing a set of 2 batteries being operated in parallel.Compared to an LSD NiMH cell, voltage drops on these batteries are steeper in the short term, however, these cells can provide approximately the same voltage until the whole cell is depleted (i.e. until the under-voltage protection IC kicks in for the lithium cell).Discharging Test: A discharge test was done for these batteries under 2A, 1A, 500mA, and 250mA conditions. The results are as follows:2A: Runtime: 44m 35s - Capacity: 1,485mAh (87.35%) - Power: 1,904mWh (74.67%)1A: Runtime: 1h 34m 20s - Capacity: 1,573mAh (92.53%) - Power: 2,210mWh (86.67%)500mA: Runtime: 3h 15m 28s - Capacity: 1,615mAh (95%) - Power: 2,362mWh (92.63%)250mA: Runtime: 6h 22m 45s - Capacity: 1,584mAh (89.49%) - Power: 2,216mWh (86.90%)It seems like the converter was the most efficient when the current draw was around 500mA when both the capacity and the power ratings have a 90+% match compared to the numbers on the label. The voltage was fairly consistent through all the current tests and does not ""curve"" downward like traditional batteries as they are being discharged. Instead, the battery experiences an abrupt drop to zero voltage when the cell is depleted (shut off due to the under-voltage protection IC kicking in for the built-in lithium cell battery). Because the voltage stays constant throughout the whole discharge cycle, it is not possible to gauge battery capacity based on the terminal voltage (it will always read around 1.51-1.53V when measured without load, or 0V when depleted).Charging Test: Charging these batteries using my battery pack, which outputs a USB voltage of around 5.3V, the charging process took 1h 55m. This was quite on point with quoted 2h timeframe from the manufacturer (the charging time may be closer to 2h exactly for USB power sources that are lower than 5.3V, although the difference would most likely be nominal). The charging process was split into two phases, a constant-current phase which drew a constant current of about 0.42A, and a constant-voltage phase as the lithium cell becomes full. The constant-current phase lasted 1h and 30m and the constant-voltage phase continued for another 22m until the current was cut off once the USB charging current reached 50mA (the charging light turns off at this point).When charging 4 batteries at once using the same cable, the current may approach 1.7A during the constant-current phase. This may cause some problems when charging from the computer USB's port since even the USB 3.0 spec only allows up to 900mA of current for unconfigured devices (newer DCP ports allow 1.5A of current). To avoid overcurrent issues, it is best to charge all 4 batteries using a charger that has at least 2A of available power.Ripple Test: Since the battery uses a converter chip to convert the internal voltage from the nominal voltage of 3.7V down to 1.5V, it impacts a ripple ""fluctuating"" voltage on the battery output terminals. When the battery was not under any load, the ripple was 12.17Hz @ 27.60mV Vpp (most likely in power saving PFM mode). Putting the battery across a 5Ω resistor (~300mA current) resulted in a different ripple pattern that was of higher frequency that was 1.023Mhz @ 12.60mV Vpp. This level of ripple is low and should not be problematic for devices running on these batteries.Shelf-Life: Since this battery relies on a converter chip that is always-on, it will use a minuscule amount of power to perform this conversion even when no load is attached. Assuming the chip draws about 25µA of power when there is no current load, the battery should last about 3 years before it is fully depleted. This should not be a problem if the batteries are actively being used and recharged, although letting the batteries sit idle without being charged for 3 or more years may result in irreversible cell damage (I assume that's why the manufacturer stated that the service life is 3 years). Devices that draw a small ghost load may kick the battery out of the power saving mode and lead to faster energy depletion. That being said, the cell will most likely run out of energy due to this load much quicker than this quiescent load.Overall, these batteries are great. Although they are much more expensive than other batteries out there, they serve my purposes quite well and I am very happy with them. For high current applications though, using NiMH cells may be more appropriate since they have higher energy overall, cheaper, and can easily tolerate 5A or more of current.",David L,4.0,6,2019,2019-06,"Good 1.5V batteries for voltage picky devices I have been wanting to get something like these for a while and they work great for my use case.

When placed under load, the voltage drops are as follows:250mA: 1.46V500mA: 1.41V750mA: 1.38V1A: 1.34V1.25A: 1.30V1.5A: 1.24V1.75A: 1.22V2A: 1.20V2.15A: 1.18VBeyond ~2.2A, the current limiter kicks in and no further increase in current is possible, even in the case of a short circuit. When measured with a multimeter under a short-circuit condition, the maximum acquired current was 2.21A. I am not quite sure how the manufacturer was able to achieve 4A of current on these cells, but it is possible that they were testing a set of 2 batteries being operated in parallel.Compared to an LSD NiMH cell, voltage drops on these batteries are steeper in the short term, however, these cells can provide approximately the same voltage until the whole cell is depleted (i.e. until the under-voltage protection IC kicks in for the lithium cell).Discharging Test: A discharge test was done for these batteries under 2A, 1A, 500mA, and 250mA conditions. The results are as follows:2A: Runtime: 44m 35s - Capacity: 1,485mAh (87.35%) - Power: 1,904mWh (74.67%)1A: Runtime: 1h 34m 20s - Capacity: 1,573mAh (92.53%) - Power: 2,210mWh (86.67%)500mA: Runtime: 3h 15m 28s - Capacity: 1,615mAh (95%) - Power: 2,362mWh (92.63%)250mA: Runtime: 6h 22m 45s - Capacity: 1,584mAh (89.49%) - Power: 2,216mWh (86.90%)It seems like the converter was the most efficient when the current draw was around 500mA when both the capacity and the power ratings have a 90+% match compared to the numbers on the label. The voltage was fairly consistent through all the current tests and does not ""curve"" downward like traditional batteries as they are being discharged. Instead, the battery experiences an abrupt drop to zero voltage when the cell is depleted (shut off due to the under-voltage protection IC kicking in for the built-in lithium cell battery). Because the voltage stays constant throughout the whole discharge cycle, it is not possible to gauge battery capacity based on the terminal voltage (it will always read around 1.51-1.53V when measured without load, or 0V when depleted).Charging Test: Charging these batteries using my battery pack, which outputs a USB voltage of around 5.3V, the charging process took 1h 55m. This was quite on point with quoted 2h timeframe from the manufacturer (the charging time may be closer to 2h exactly for USB power sources that are lower than 5.3V, although the difference would most likely be nominal). The charging process was split into two phases, a constant-current phase which drew a constant current of about 0.42A, and a constant-voltage phase as the lithium cell becomes full. The constant-current phase lasted 1h and 30m and the constant-voltage phase continued for another 22m until the current was cut off once the USB charging current reached 50mA (the charging light turns off at this point).When charging 4 batteries at once using the same cable, the current may approach 1.7A during the constant-current phase. This may cause some problems when charging from the computer USB's port since even the USB 3.0 spec only allows up to 900mA of current for unconfigured devices (newer DCP ports allow 1.5A of current). To avoid overcurrent issues, it is best to charge all 4 batteries using a charger that has at least 2A of available power.Ripple Test: Since the battery uses a converter chip to convert the internal voltage from the nominal voltage of 3.7V down to 1.5V, it impacts a ripple ""fluctuating"" voltage on the battery output terminals. When the battery was not under any load, the ripple was 12.17Hz @ 27.60mV Vpp (most likely in power saving PFM mode). Putting the battery across a 5Ω resistor (~300mA current) resulted in a different ripple pattern that was of higher frequency that was 1.023Mhz @ 12.60mV Vpp. This level of ripple is low and should not be problematic for devices running on these batteries.Shelf-Life: Since this battery relies on a converter chip that is always-on, it will use a minuscule amount of power to perform this conversion even when no load is attached. Assuming the chip draws about 25µA of power when there is no current load, the battery should last about 3 years before it is fully depleted. This should not be a problem if the batteries are actively being used and recharged, although letting the batteries sit idle without being charged for 3 or more years may result in irreversible cell damage (I assume that's why the manufacturer stated that the service life is 3 years). Devices that draw a small ghost load may kick the battery out of the power saving mode and lead to faster energy depletion. That being said, the cell will most likely run out of energy due to this load much quicker than this quiescent load.Overall, these batteries are great. Although they are much more expensive than other batteries out there, they serve my purposes quite well and I am very happy with them. For high current applications though, using NiMH cells may be more appropriate since they have higher energy overall, cheaper, and can easily tolerate 5A or more of current.",0.4855028641392277,0.14192873904995118,Positive

1539,B07MWYYDTM,Other,2018-12-30,Verified Purchase,Good performance except for capacity," I purchased a set of 4 AA cells for use in wireless mics. Wanting to know how long a charge would last, I constructed a test fixture with a 15 ohm load (100 mA at 1.5 V). Although the specified capacity of these cells is 1,250 mAh, they only produced 657, 1,054, 1,100 and 1,112 mAh. These results are repeatable and sub-par. Might this be an indicator of other quality deficiencies? Other than capacity the cells performed well, maintaining a constant 1.5 V output until they drop abruptly to 0 V when depleted. This being the case, the device they power will not give a low battery warning - it will just stop working. These units incorporate a rechargeable lithium cell, recharging circuit and output voltage regulator within the profile of a AA package. The voltage regulator apparently cuts out if overloaded, preventing damage to the lithium cell. The series regulator inherently produces heat proportional to load current, explaining why some users reported heating. Unfortunately, maximum load current is not specified. I like the design because it provides the full 1.5 V required to operate my wireless mics and would probably give it 5 stars if they met their specified capacity.",fixitrite,3.0,12,2018,2018-12,"Good performance except for capacity I purchased a set of 4 AA cells for use in wireless mics.

I went through the process to get a refund and ended up having to chat with an Amazon customer rep that issued a refund.  I reordered and received the next order in the promised time. I am writing this review for the AAA set of batteries.  I ordered 4 because that's how many i needed.  When I installed them in my device it would not power on.  My next step was to charge them.  So I got out my volt meter to be on the safe side to check voltage to see why they needed charging.  I tested the voltage and 3 of the 4 tested at just over 1.5 volts.  The problem was the 4th battery that tested at just over 4 volts.  The batteries didn't need charging at all.  I have 1 battery that was not quality checked before it left the factory and was dangerously over voltage for an AAA battery.  The batteries charge well so far.  Because of the lack of in house quality control, I can not give this product more than 3 stars.  I will update this review once I have contacted the seller and try to resolve the 4th battery.  I also purchased at the same time the AA batteries and will test and review them soon.Update:  I have changed the rating from 3 to 4 stars.  I am in the process of monitoring these batteries.  In my original review, one of the 4 batteries was over voltage.  I charged it one cycle, retested it fresh off the charge and it was still over voltage at 4.03 volts.  I decided to let it rest for 2 hours to stabilize after charging and retested it.  To my amazement, it tested 1.533 volts.  I installed it with the other 3 in my appliance and it worked fine.  I will continue to monitor these regularly to insure that they remain in specs.

I decided to let it rest for 2 hours to stabilize after charging and retested it.  To my amazement, it tested 1.533 volts.  I installed it with the other 3 in my appliance and it worked fine.  I will continue to monitor these regularly to insure that they remain in specs.  I am testing the idea that in some instances, the internal circuit that monitors and charges needs a cooling down period to switch from 3.7 lithium volts before it bucks down to 1.5 volts.  I will update with my results after a few days have passed.",0.3827350427350427,0.10152777777777777,Positive

1730,B07D1LMMDD,AAA,2018-08-09,Verified Purchase,Great product great customer service., The batteries are a great convenient design and the included cable to charge all 4 at once is a great inclusion. Their capacity is not as high as non-rechareable but are great for things like flashlights or game controllers.They also come with a nice little storage box which is great for keeping a handful charged to quickly swap out. Charging only took maximum of 2 hours. They do not come charged. Due to their cost vs non-rechargeable and their lower charge density it looks like recharging about 16 times would equal the cost of a 32 pack at costco. But also consider the amount of waste from throwing batteries out. Rated for 1000 cycles means they should pay for themselves many times over.I purchased 3 packs and only 1 battery was bad out of a total of 12.HITRENDS had excellent customer service and gave a partial refund which I thought was better than dealing dealing with shipping a whole pack back when 3 worked perfectly fine.,Amazon Customer,5.0,8,2018,2018-08,Great product great customer service.

1791,B086L3Q8YX,Other,2019-12-29,Not Verified,Not Quite Up To Specs," When it comes to physics, you don't get something for nothing. This has always been the case with rechargeable batteries which have tried to replace standard alkaline batteries. While companies have tried in the past to make rechargeable batteries that were the same size as AA alkaline batteries, there is always some kind of compromise. With older Ni-Cad rechargeable batteries the voltage was always far less than 1.5 Volts, the amount of time they lasted was always shorter and they would only recharge a few dozen times before they had to be thrown away.These new rechargeable batteries  use Lithium as their storage medium and while they do last far longer than their Ni-Cad counterparts, they still have a problem with not delivering the minimum 1.5 Volts that Alkaline batteries do. To be sure, they are much better than Ni-Cads, but the highest voltage that I could charge these batteries to was about 1.45 Volts. Although AA Alkaline batteries state that they run 1.5 Volts, the average AA battery produces around 1.64 Volts when they are brand new.While these voltage numbers do not sound like a huge difference, some very sensitive electronics are not ""fooled"" by the lower voltages and will not work correctly, if at all. If you are using batteries to run something very simple like a motor or a flashlight you will likely not notice any difference in performance other than that the motor may run slightly slower or the light may shine a little less brighter. If you are using these batteries to run something like a GPS receiver or a medical device the problem could be a bit more serious though.While these batteries come much, much closer to replacing disposable alkaline batteries than ever before, the technology is still not 100% there.

The replacements are working fine.  I use strictly for my Xbox one controllers.  Before re-reviewing, I charged all 4 batteries.  I then used 2 of them and they lasted about as long as a normal generic battery (around 20 hours).  I used a different set of batteries for the rest of the week, as I wanted to see if the others held a charge.  Upon placing the batteries back into the controller after a week of sitting around, I saw only a small degradation this time around (batteries didn't last quite as long, about 16 hours).  This batch out performed the initial batteries I received.  This review takes the following into account:The price of the batteries vs. the performance of the product. (I equate these to a set of how a generic battery would perform since it is over half the price of other USB batteries out there).Charge seemed to retain longer than the previous set that was sent.The charging time was my mistake.  These state that it should take about 4 hours to charge, so that is the norm for these batteries.The superb customer service I received.  I was contacted immediately about my initial score, and they asked to send replacement batteries to test (on their dime).  They initially sent the incorrect battery (AAA vs. AA).  I told them they sent the wrong battery and they quickly shipped out a replacement AA set.Used for my Xbox One controller.Pros:PriceIf charging batteries and using right away, they seem to work about as long as regular generic batteries.Con: If charging the batteries and storing for later use, the charge degrades within approximately one week, and will have to be recharged.The time to charge the batteries seems to fluctuate.

1852,B0824WB5ST,Other,2020-07-07,Verified Purchase,Super versatile set of rechargeable batteries," This brand of rechargeable batteries has a few different sets, I went with the mix of 2 AAA, and 2 AA's which seemed to be the most versatile since the AAA size comes with an adapter to fit in AA if I need more AA's.Note that the AAA is smaller in 600 mWh capacity than the larger AA (1500 mWh) but that's the tradeoff in versatility with the size coverage. Also the AAA ones need a micro USB cable to charge (the set comes with a single USB cable split to 4 micro usb heads which more than covers the 2 included AAA batteries.The coolest feature that attracted me to these batteries was the AA heads come off and become a regular USB male plug that can go directly into any USB port like on a computer and charge directly without needing a separate cable or charger. This feature makes these so convenient as I don't have many devices that need batteries and didn't want the extra clutter of having a separate charger.I purchased these mainly for use with my Oculus Quest controllers which eat batteries very quickly, and so far the battery life even with the AAA's (on AA adapter) has lasted as long as the disposable AA batteries I had been going through.

1863,B0824WB5ST,AAA,2020-06-28,Not Verified,Review of both AA and AAA options," I acquired both the AA and AAA options of these batteries. They differ slightly in that the AAA is charged using an included USB adapter (Micro-USB) that plugs into all 4 batteries, whereas the AA battery plugs directly into a USB-A port. While there’s no need for the adapter on the AA, note that each battery requires its own USB-A port (so charging 4 at a time means you need 4 open ports). Because the AAA uses an adapter, you only need one open USB-A port to charge all 4 at once.Both batteries have a built-in light that blinks when charging. Once the blinking stops, you know the batteries are full. A minor difference, but the AAA has a green light whereas the AA a red one.Note that neither battery came with a wall charger. You will need your own source. I tested different options to see if any had issues. First, I used my fast charger from my OnePlus 7 Pro phone. Then I used an older (slow) wall charger for my Apple iPad. Finally, I used USB ports on my computer and a HUB connected to my computer. All options charged the batteries without issue.The Huahui AAA comes with capsules that convert them to AA. Unfortunately, there are 4 batteries but only two capsules. From what I tested; they definitely work. But I admit the capsules do feel a little cheap, and they are slightly longer than a true AA battery. I measured an AA Duracell at 1.96” (inches) and the Huahui AAA in the AA capsule at 1.98”. Not a huge difference at .02”, but if the device you are putting them into is picky, it may cause some problems. Additionally, the Huahui AAA battery itself is slightly larger (1.74”) than a AAA Duracell (1.72”). Again, that’s only a .02” discrepancy, but something to keep in mind.The Huahui AA on the other hand is the exact same length as the AA Duracell. Both measured in at exactly 1.96”. So, they should work in any device that takes AAs.The diameter of both batteries is spot on. I was even able to slide the Huahui AA into the very tight compartment on my Apple Magic Trackpad.I also tested these batteries (both AA and AAA in capsule) on my Wireless Xbox and Wii U controllers. Worked great. And both batteries were detected as having a full charge.While many devices today have built-in lithium-ion batteries, there are still many things that require traditional batteries. From flashlights, to remotes, to shaving devices. I love these Huahui batteries because they charge directly into a USB port rather than needing an external charger. Makes it super easy to transport and charge on the go, especially considering you can just pop them into a power bank. So far, I’m loving them and have had no issues.",Consumer Outlook,5.0,6,2020,2020-06,"Review of both AA and AAA options I acquired both the AA and AAA options of these batteries.

1864,B0824WB5ST,AA,2020-06-28,Not Verified,Review of both AA and AAA options," I acquired both the AA and AAA options of these batteries. They differ slightly in that the AAA is charged using an included USB adapter (Micro-USB) that plugs into all 4 batteries, whereas the AA battery plugs directly into a USB-A port. While there’s no need for the adapter on the AA, note that each battery requires its own USB-A port (so charging 4 at a time means you need 4 open ports). Because the AAA uses an adapter, you only need one open USB-A port to charge all 4 at once.Both batteries have a built-in light that blinks when charging. Once the blinking stops, you know the batteries are full. A minor difference, but the AAA has a green light whereas the AA a red one.Note that neither battery came with a wall charger. You will need your own source. I tested different options to see if any had issues. First, I used my fast charger from my OnePlus 7 Pro phone. Then I used an older (slow) wall charger for my Apple iPad. Finally, I used USB ports on my computer and a HUB connected to my computer. All options charged the batteries without issue.The Huahui AAA comes with capsules that convert them to AA. Unfortunately, there are 4 batteries but only two capsules. From what I tested; they definitely work. But I admit the capsules do feel a little cheap, and they are slightly longer than a true AA battery. I measured an AA Duracell at 1.96” (inches) and the Huahui AAA in the AA capsule at 1.98”. Not a huge difference at .02”, but if the device you are putting them into is picky, it may cause some problems.

The concept is simple and so far I don't see a big problem with battery life. I was a little worried that the space needed for the USB prong would take away space for the battery - and it does. But I don't know that it affects battery life enough to matter.To be fair, I am using them in a low current situation. I think these are awesome for remote controls. When they run down, you just charge them overnight and you are ready to go! FOR REMOTE CONTROLS, it doesn't get any better than this.The only real negative I see is making sure you don't lose the cap/positive terminal when charging. They could have possibly included some sort of wire or string/cable that kept it attached but it is a SMALL ISSUE.Overall, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND these to someone looking to replace a remote control battery.

I like that only because the USB-A version in the AA batteries sounds like a great idea, but even charger blocks with four USB outlets don't work well as the size of the battery is typically smaller than the diameter of the AA battery, allowing only every other slot to be used. With the microUSB forcing a harness of sorts, it's great to find a single harness included that fans out from a single USB-A to four microUSB plugs.Even if microUSB is probably the worst USB design of them all (sometimes very difficult to plug in right), it's still the dominant form factor even for new devices, despite USB-C being around for a while now. So if you lose the harness, you can probably easily find four USB-A to microUSB ""laying around"".Once plugged in, charging of all four batteries at the same time take as mere 0.5A at 5.2V.

They're easy to recharge and all of the equipment is small and doesn't take up a lot of space. Apparently they can be reused/recharged over and over again for 1000 times or so.

1893,B0824WB5ST,AA,2020-06-12,Not Verified,Best invention since sliced bread," I don't know why it took me so long to discover these batteries. or maybe they are a recent invention. Regardless, they are wonderful. I do not like using disposable batteries for the obvious environmental cost.Most people throw away batteries in the regular garbage can and they must be disposed of properly. That's why I favor rechargeable batteries. But when you're traveling, rechargeable batteries are a pain because you have to take the charging station, which is often bulky. It also robs you of another plug in your hotel room, and you may not have that many plugs. That's why this is such a great invention because you can plug it into any standard USB port and it will recharge your batteries.

Regardless, they are wonderful. I do not like using disposable batteries for the obvious environmental cost.Most people throw away batteries in the regular garbage can and they must be disposed of properly. That's why I favor rechargeable batteries. But when you're traveling, rechargeable batteries are a pain because you have to take the charging station, which is often bulky. It also robs you of another plug in your hotel room, and you may not have that many plugs. That's why this is such a great invention because you can plug it into any standard USB port and it will recharge your batteries.

1918,B07HQ7QV7W,AA,2020-08-14,Verified Purchase,What the heck do I do with all my old NiMH batteries now?!?," These batteries are absolutely brilliant.  They look like AA batteries, but inside each one is a 3.7V 750mAH lithium ion cell and a voltage regulator.  The voltage regulator takes the 3.7V output from the li-ion battery and steps it down to 1.5V and *keeps* it there until the internal cell drops below operating voltage spec (usually around 3.3V).  At which point, the voltage regulator drops the voltage from 1.5V to 1.1V, enough for most devices to trip the ""low battery"" indicator.As for the longevity, I can honestly say that I have no idea how long the batteries last.  I bought the set of four AA batteries with the charger and I keep that in my bag with my PowerA Wireless GameCube controller for Switch.  I play Smash Ultimate about 4 hours a day for 4-5 days a week (not competitive, I just really like the game) and rotate the batteries out each day (use batteries 1 and 2 on Day 1, batteries 3 and 4 on Day 2, 1 and 2 on Day 3,you get the idea).  I charged all four batteries to full back in February and decided to see how long they would last.I haven't charged them since.For comparison, the same amount of playtime on standard alkaline batteries is around 80ish hours (batteries that came with the controller at 1.6V gave off the low battery warning after a month and reported 1.15V on my multimeter).  The last NiMH batteries I tried in these controllers were Eneloops, but those always gave me the ""low battery"" indicator on the controller.The price is a bit steep, but considering each battery has gone through about 240 hours of gaming without a hiccup, I'd say it's well worth the money.",William Oshana,5.0,8,2020,2020-08,"What the heck do I do with all my old NiMH batteries now?!?

I no longer feel guilty expending a ton of AAAs for the sake of my cats entertainment. Also you don't have to worry about getting them wet since they're sealed. I wouldn't take them diving though...",0.6075757575757575,0.23181818181818184,Positive

That's plenty for any show I do.  Disadvantages is, the battery indicator on the microphones is always 3 out of 3 bars. The indicator does not indicate capacity remaining, only voltage.  I wish they made an 8 bay charger, or something more than the 4 bay and less than the 20 bay.8/11/20Follow up.I now have 2 of these chargers and 16 AA batteries. I use them for karaoke mics. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to use them every day since Covid to really test their durability/cycling tolerance.I'm using them in VocoPro 5800 mics. I can leave the mics on for a 4 hour show with no issues. I've left them on for a 7 hour show with no issues.They charge pretty quickly. I've never had to wait more than about 90 minutes for 4 batteries to charge. I have both chargers plugged into a 7 port powered USB hub. The chargers draw about 1.25 amps per charger. The hub is capable of 30 watts which is 6 amps at 5 volts, but I'm guessing that the charger is only capable of drawing the 1.25 amps, which is half of 2.4 amps, which is what a normal phone charger delivers to a phone. It's probably because it's charging at a lower voltage. Perhaps 1.5 volts x 1.25 amps which is just a little less than 2 watts (1.875 watts).One thing I've found is that if the batteries sit for any length of time (say, over 2 weeks) and you try to use them, they don't hold their charge. I used 2 week old batteries in a couple mics recently and they squealed out and died less than an hour into the event.When fully charged, though, with these mics, they last a good long time. At least 7 hours as stated above.2 minuses:1. Using with mics with battery indicators is, the battery indicators work off voltage.

The only negative to that is that you don't get a depleting battery gauge, it just goes until it dies.

I tried charging in an expensive battery charger and it will either charge these for a while then just stop, or it doesn't even start charging them. I noticed rapid flickering of the blue lights on the batteries when my charger showed 99% then some stopped but others kept charging for a while. (I'm not sure if they were being charged at all because when I put them into their own charger they went for a while and stopped charging, this could be because their charger is timed and not a smart charger though, I never tested their voltage to see for sure but maybe one day I will...) The ones that stopped charging on my charger won't charge on it again.. It just doesn't ""see"" them at all anymore, they still seem to charge fine on their own charger though. But it makes me wary that the batteries may be damaged now.2. Cost. These are pretty expensive for a 4 pack of AA batteries. And I'm not sure if they'll last long enough to break even vs Alkaline or vs NiMH because some of what I've read about them isn't great on the durability front.3. No included power adapter. The back of the charger says to use a power source that is 5 volts and up to 2.4 Amps input. The manual says don't go over 5v input as it may damage the charger.

I used them for a couple months and they last a good while. They do charge very quickly. I was surprised when they were done charging so fast.Time will only tell how long these batteries will last as far as longevity goes (in years) but I got them for an incredibly low price so I couldn't resist trying them out.The big thing here is these will hold a voltage around 1.5v for the entire use of the battery. This means the voltage will drop off quickly when the batteries are at the end of charge, so your devices will just die on you when the batteries die. This also means you likely won't face low battery messages or any other kind of annoyance until the battery is fully dead and your device shuts off. I use nimh batteries and those, they seem to flash a low battery warning on just about everything for the entire use of the product. Its also impossible to get them fully discharged which results in poor performance over time, however most people say these kind of batteries don't have memory effect but they seem to last less and less each time I use them. The only way to get a nimh battery to full discharge is to put them in a charger that discharges the battery, I have that charger and I have done that many times, and most of the time I take the batteries out they still have quite a bit of power left in them even though my device reports they are dead batteries that need recharging. These batteries don't do that, they will fully drain and your device will shut off when the batteries need to be changed or recharged.

2121,B07HQ7QV7W,AA,2019-11-13,Not Verified,"Nice constant voltage, but abrupt drop-off  :)"," All too many devices need AA cells, not many take 14500s (4.2V out of the charger), and some don't like NiMH cells (constant 1.2V), so these fill the niche in providing a constant 1.5V from fresh out of the charger 'til they abruptly drop dead.  And I despise alkaleaks, as those hateful little things will leak their corrosive innards in your flashlight, remote control, wireless mouse, whatever you have them in, and ruin the device.  So trying these Tenavolts was a nice compromise between maintaining a fresh-alkaleak voltage from start to end, no drop-off.They charge easily in the included charger (straight 5V from the USB supply), lighting the cell's internal LED while charging, and going out when done.  That's it.While they may not work in high-drain devices like camera-flash units (not like that's plastered allllll over the description in multiple places), they do work fine in AA flashlights like my SP10 and E03.  In fact, my E03 has perfect mode-spacing when using an alkaleak, but all modes are brighter and clustered together when using a 14500, so the Tenavolt keeps that nice mode-spacing without the slightest danger of leaking inside the light itself.  And so it is for most AA-powered doodads that I tried.My only critique is that sudden drop-deadness when the internal cell is spent.  There's zero warning, no dimming or fading (slow or rapid) to forewarn that you have 5sec of light left, etc.  It's unnerving.  Still, I just keep a space cell handy Just In Case.  It's a small price to pay to be able to rest assured that you won't come back to a salt-block and ruined springs/contacts where an alkaleak used to be.Constant unwavering 1.5V from start to end, no chance of leaking and ruining the device it's in, vs a sudden death when the cell needs recharging.

So, come very much ready to put into equipment for immediate use.  Add a star for 6 stars.Recharge cycle a bit slower than claimed, with 2.5 hours or so, and full charge capacity at 1 amp discharge of 1600 to 1650 mAh.  Minus 1 star for 5 stars.  (this is because of the claimed recharge rate of 1 hr and 48 minutes and a bit below the claimed 2700 mWh.  Still a very good showing, especially for a constant 1 amp load)For those that don't want to throw away batch after batch of alkaline batteries, these serve the great fill-in purpose for those devices that don't work with NiMH or NiCd rechargeables because of the voltage disparity between alkaline and NiMH/NiCd chemistry.  As these put out a very solid 1.5 volts, if you have devices that don't quite seem to work as long as they should, or even at all, with NiMH/NiCD, then these are excellent choices.  While NiZn can also do the trick, they do go up to 1.65 volts, which may be damaging/problematic for some devices, while these should never be cause for concern, as 1.5 volts is well within the operating range (at first) for alkaline batteries.These are more costly than NiMH, so I plan on using them in devices that I used to have to make the choice between usability (high with Alkaline/low with NiMH) and cost to environment (alkaline high, NiMH low) and per usage cost (alkaline high, NiMH low).For example, my son's electric song/piano toy required that I find the best performing NiMH batteries, and even then performance would quickly degrade such that the toy would become unusable long before I would expect from high performance NiMH batteries (Eneloop pro and Amazon 2400).  Upon trying these out, the toy works perfectly, with long run life. No more swapping/charging batteries too quickly, or giving in to alkaline!Another example is a laser level I have.  When I use my best NiMH batteries (2 batteries required), the unit will detect the lower voltage as an issue, and start to flash in the pattern that indicates low battery voltage.  While it still works, it is disconcerting/unpleasant to have it continuously flash while trying to line-up any work.  With these, the laser light is rock steady, and I am no longer bothered by the flashing (or with throwing away the alkaline batteries that only last a couple of hours).If you have devices that work with NiMH/NiCd, then don't fret about these batteries.  But, if you have devices that need a little bit more oomph, then these will fit the ticket.Since they give full voltage until exhaustion, detection that works upon voltage for low battery indication will not be reliable, so do not use them if you require sufficient notice that they are about to go out.  For me, when the device stops working is fine, as I can just grab another two and swap them out quickly, with no danger.  (maybe add a beeping sound to the circuitry when the internal li-ion is at the last 10 percent or so?)Time will tell about longevity.

I originally used AA rechargeable NiMH batters for a flashlight I keep on my hard hat and for a laser lever for work. The problem with the NiMH is that they dim and take FOREVER to charge.

The AA 1.5v LI-ion are not really AA batteries. They are smaller 3.7v LI-ion batteries with a AA housing that use circuitry to convert 3.7v to 1.5v.

I also really like that they can charge via USB cord - this makes it easy to charge them as we have lots of other USB devices.  I'm pretty happy with the purchase so far...

Also I had commented that the charger wasn’t so bad, well after getting a real charger I realize just how bad the provided charger was. It’s as bad as the batteries. The seller sent me replacement batteries in case the ones I had were defective, which was a wonderful thing to do, but those were just as bad. Quite frankly The Amazon Bacics rechargeables are a much better battery and therefore a much better buy. Thanks for the support EBT but this product is not up to quality standards set by other foreign brands.",0.4587301587301587,-0.0037698412698412326,Negative

3349,B00HZV9WTM,AA,2019-12-01,Verified Purchase,Evaluate and break in Amazon batteries not made in Japan before rushing to judgement," I am fairly new to rechargeables and the first thing that jumps out at me is the cost of any brand with a decent reputation.  To me that means spending the money up front to get ""smart"" charging and evaluation equipment.  That reduces the chances of ruining new batteries, or worse yet ruining the devices being powered.  I purchased a Nitecore and and an Opus bt-c3100.  Quickly I learned to categorize 18650 batteries into three rough groups:  total scam batteries that should never be used because they barely put out any power and cannot hold a charge.  From reviews I have seen that means 400 mah hours or so from an 18650.  The second category is the extremely common ""knock-offs"" that copy, sometimes well and many times poorly, popular top performers and sell for much less.  These from what I have seen and from my own observations can  have power output of anywhere from 30% to 80% or so of the power of the tried and true name brand.I thought long and hard before purchasing the newest Amazon AA nimh high-capacity knowing they were not made in the Panasonic eneloop factory and were fairly pricey.  But I felt  it would be a good learning experience and for now I only power led flashlights and solar walkway lights.The first thing I did was read the directions!!!!!!! and it said charge at 250 mah.  The nitecore only goes down to 300 mah so I first discharged them on the Opus at 200 mah for 12 hours 20 minutes to 1-1.1 volts and all four(sorry no statistically significant data from this guy) gave off a measured 2440 or more mah , a little better than the rating of 2400 mah.  Charging at 200 mah took 13 hours and the cells absorbed 2570 mah , well above the 2400 rating.I will leave the discharge and power analysis to the electrical engineers with the knowledge, expertise, and software.  I will give my layman's opinion that initially these four Amazon high-capacity nimh batteries are  not fakes stuffed with sand and appear more promising to deliver  good service than the knock-offs that cut critical corners to keep the price down.  I recommend to other newbies to take the time to charge all rechargeables conservatively with a smart charger.  It is probably a good idea to first discharge and recharge these batteries even though mine came fully charged.  You would not take your brand new car and redline the engine out of the showroom.

And there is a slight decline in quality.," These batteries have not changed their advertising; but they have changed the country of origin.  These Amazon Basics batteries have gone through some changes  Started out as black with green leaf motif.  They were made in Japan, and their claimed capacity was the same as the Sanyo eneloop.  And about the time that Panasonic put their logo onto eneloop batteries Amazon Basics became grey with a thin green line circle at the top.  They had an electrical signature very similar to the eneloop which have become the “gold standard “ in terms of quality.  I have both AB and Panasonic batteries, and they meet and exceed their claimed capacities.  The main difference is that the Panasonic eneloop batteries are substantially more expensive.When I receive new batteries, I don’t care if they come “precharged “ or not.  Instead I put them through a couple of renew cycles.  I’v noticed that the capacity of the batteries increase after two sometimes three discharge test or renew cycles.When I bought some more AB rechargeables,  they were still grey, but the green circle at the top was wider than before.  And I found that one or two didn’t quite meet the claimed capacity on the first refresh cycle.  On the subsequent cycles, they met/exceeded their capacity expectations.  Upon using this newest incarnation of Amazon Basics rechargeable high capacity AA,I noticed that they needed to be recharged just a bit sooner than the previous generation.  Probably would not have noted the difference had it not been for the difference when initially charging, discharging, etc in the battery charger analyzers renew cycles.  That is when I used a magnifying glass and read Made in China on the batteries.I don’t know exactly when Jeff Bezos and co decided to charge his sourcing for manufacturing his brand. Just wanted to pass on that these Amazon Basics high capacity AA and AAA batteries are still good batteries.

3570,B00HZV9WTM,AAA,2019-10-11,Verified Purchase,Long-Lasting Battery Life," I’ve been slowly (very slowly) converting my house to be more self-sustaining.  As such, I’m taking small steps and one of the steps is using battery-operated sensor lights to illuminate my basement.  The lights I use (AMIR Motion Sensor Light https://amzn.to/2B3wjHu ) take three AAA batteries each.  The motion sensor lights come in packs of six.  That means I need 18 batteries for each light pack (as I said, this is a slow transition).Initially, I purchased one eight-pack of the Amazon Basics high-capacity rechargeables and bought copper-topped batteries for the remaining lights.  What I noticed was the copper-topped batteries wore out much quicker than the rechargeables. The rechargeables lasted two to three times longer (if not more) than the non-rechargeables.  I quickly realized I was being penny wise and pound foolish by purchasing non-rechargeable batteries, so now I only buy the rechargeable. They really are high capacity batteries.I’ve dabbled with other brands of rechargeable batteries, but have found that these not only last the longest, but seem to recharge quicker. In the long run, they’re not only more economical, but better on the environment. The packaging is mostly cardboard, except for the plastic shrink wrap.  The plastic uses recycle code 1 which is purportedly one of the safer and easier to recycle categories of plastic.All in all, I’m very happy with these batteries.

I go out at nite a lot, and tend to use my headlamp a lot. So I tend to be an extreme user of  rechargeable batteries. But with the current set nearing their charge limit, I was kinda stunned. They lasted just a year. I have other brands that have lasted years longer. So I wasn't going back to buy that brand. They should last more then a year, even at my rate of usage. So I got this time  Amazon branded NiMH batteries. They are made in Japan. They are sent to you as nearly as I can tell fully changed, or very near it. My smart charger immediately kicked them back as ready to go. They produce a lot of power, and they tend to keep going for a long time before they need recharged. All pro's. In fact, from a power output, to a longevity of the battery, I really can't tell any difference between these and the top (expensive) name brands. And they are a fraction of the cost. I haven't had them long enough to judge durability. But in the initial charges, they all work out to the same amount of time in my potent Cree powered headlamp (it sucks power like there's no tomorow lol).  My only complaint here is it's TOUGH getting them out of their plastic shrink wrap. If you don't have a tool, you better have some pretty strong fingers. However, that's not worth a star.

3884,B00HZV9WTM,AA,2019-07-04,Verified Purchase,Not great compared to regular AA batteries," I am making a comparison with these batteries compared to other rechargeables I own (18650 various brands) and Duracell's Procell (non-rechargeable) that I normally use.I am using a nitecore charger to charge my batteries. It is compatible with various types of batteries, the 18650 and AA's in particular.The device I am using these in is my bluetooth controllers for my Windows Mixed Reality headset.The only reason I bought these batteries for my two controllers (two AA each) is because the procell's I've been using only lasts two days and I thought that was terrible. Well, these are worse. And might be even worse depending on how long they last until they can't charge anymore due to the how often I got to charge them.So here are my cons:1) Longevity of the charge. It is very short, don't even last 3 hours of constant use until the batteries die. The procell's I normally use last me two days of use. Comparing it to my LG 18650 batteries (which are 3000mAh) which are used in vape products, and my cree led flashlight, which seem to last week at high usage. The 18650's are high discharge batteries, so I'm not sure if these Amazon AA's are with that comparison.2) Cost, due to longevity and other batteries I use, these are the most expensive per life of a charge. I bought the 8 pack due to I need 4 for my controllers (2 each) and then another 4 ready to go.3) Heat. Normally if you batteries get hot during, or during charging, then that is a really bad thing. The 18650 batteries have a chance to explode. So I'm not sure if these will get to that point too, but during use they are getting warm to the touch. During charging almost too hot to handle.The batteries do say ""Made in japan"" printed on the label, which was the only reason I bought them.I'll need to buy some other AA Ni-MH to compare with, but for now I am not impressed and won't be buying anymore of these from Amazon.",firejackal,2.0,7,2019,2019-07,"Not great compared to regular AA batteries I am making a comparison with these batteries compared to other rechargeables I own (18650 various brands) and Duracell's Procell (non-rechargeable) that I normally use.I am using a nitecore charger to charge my batteries.

I thought I would buy from Amazon basics because Amazon is reliable right? WRONG!I unboxed these and within 10 seconds of me putting them in the battery holder, the light itself didn't turn on so I started troubleshooting and as soon as I touched the batteries to bring them out, I burned my finger and what followed was a smell of burst batteries. I recognize the smell because a year ago I had a portable power bank that had burst and filled my room with a terrible chemical smell. Anyways, I also noticed some smoke coming from the batteries and soon realized what had happened. The batteries got so hot that they melted the plastic part of the battery holder. Needless to say I'm very disappointed because I thought these were going to be good rechargable batteries and wow, I got burned. Literally.

Most of my rechargeables are Eneloop batteries, these were purchased because they are a bit less expensive and I wanted to see how they worked.

This may also be a fault with the device's design but I have not experienced this with the Eneloop batteries and holding the batteries side by side there is a barely discernable difference.

I will update this review with more info once I know for sure, but so far so good.",0.566957264957265,0.15091666666666664,Positive

It seems that the ""covering"" on the battery extends longer on the bottom and you can't remove or trim it to get them to fit in tight battery compartments.  So I will NOT be purchasing any more of these.  Soooo disappointed : (  Can't speak to the life of the battery as I have not had them long enough to have input on that.  Would not recommend due to the ""fit"" issue.",0.5169642857142859,0.029719387755102026,Positive

4619,B00HZV9WTM,AAA,2019-01-04,Not Verified,"I've tested them, and so far, they are as advertised!"," First, read the top-rated review from NLee the Engineer, and then go look at his reviews for comparable batteries for some background.I've owned and used 4th-generation standard Eneloop batteries for several years, but it's only been in the past year that I got more serious about looking into different brands and testing for Ni-MH rechargeable batteries.  First, if you're only knowledge of rechargeable batteries is the NiCad versions from the 90's, modern rechargeables are MUCH better than that.  In fact, while they start off at a slightly lower charge than 1.5V alkalines, alkalines quickly burn off that charge and continue to do so, to the point where 1.25V Ni-MH batteries actually output more voltage after about 30 minutes of use, and often remain usable for longer.Sanyo/Panasonic's Eneloop brand was a pioneer of the Ni-MH battery in the late 2000's, and some of those early versions still perform quite well by current standards.  A typical capacity for a ""standard"" Eneloop is around 1900-2000 mAh.  But there are increasingly ""high-capacity"" Ni-MH batteries that claim even higher capacities - perhaps 2300 (EBL), 2400 (Amazon High-Capacity), 2600 (Mr. Batt), or even 2800 mAh (EBL, again).Based on testing results and circumstantial evidence collected by consumers, it appears likely that many (but not all) of the original AmazonBasics rechargeable were simply re-branded models of early-version Eneloops.  This ""high-capacity"" version, then appears to be re-brand (or at least a functional equivalent) of the Eneloop XX model, which was later named the ""Eneloop Pro"".I tested capacity with an OPUS BT-C2000 Charger/Analyzer.  You do this by charging the battery fully, then discharging it fully, while the BT-C2000 measures the amount of power discharged until it is ""empty"".  The results for the Amazon High-Capacity brand were as good (or better than advertised).  For the 8 AA batteries I tested, the capacity ranged from 2357 to 2404 mAH - a remarkably narrow window reflecting good quality control.  For the 4 AAA batteries I tested, the range was 826 to 856 mAh - impressive given that the packaging indicates only a ""minimum of 800 mAh"".I think unless you are looking at using them in digital cameras or other very high-drain devices, the high-capacity rechargeables probably are not a necessity, and investing in a good stable of standard Ni-MH batteries is a better investment.  But for a much better price than the Eneloop Pro's, these AmazonBasics High-Capacity batteries seem to be the real deal.NOTE: I will update my post over time if I notice any significant changes in their performance.
