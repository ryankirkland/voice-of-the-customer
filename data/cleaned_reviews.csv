0,B08267BBJT,AAA,2020-08-11,Verified Purchase,"Didn't work, then worked, now don't work again"," All I got in terms of use out of these batteries were about three days of use out of two of them and have had no additional success. I bought them because I was bleeding through AAA batteries and was hoping the compact design would be better than something more bulky.Right out of the box, I charged them until the light was green indicating they were fully charged, tried to use them in a couple of devices and didn't have any luck. I was going to return them, but my friend suggested I switch from charging in an extension cord to directly in a wall socket. I thought that it did the trick, even though I thought that was silly, when I tried the batteries in a device after letting them charge overnight plugged directly into the wall socket, they did work, and worked well.About three days later, the device stopped working in the middle of high powered usage (hair trimmers). I swapped the batteries I had in there for the other two that had been charging the entire time, and they didn't work. I went out and bought regular AAA batteries and the device went back to working just fine. I tried the batteries in a few other devices and they aren't working. It seems they work just enough to convince you they work, then stop working.I don't often leave feedback on products, but I felt it was important to say here that I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. If not totally faulty, they are at the very least completely inconsistent, and you'd do better just buying disposables.",Jasmine Carroll,1.0,8,2020,2020-08,"Didn't work, then worked, now don't work again All I got in terms of use out of these batteries were about three days of use out of two of them and have had no additional success.

50,B079JFK22D,AA,2020-06-27,Verified Purchase,"Works well, but understand what you're getting."," These are novel and strange batteries. It's super convenient to recharge via USB chargers (which are ubiquitous these days). It'd be nice if they came with a 4-way cable to permit charging all cells off one suitable USB charger. These are excellent when you have a device that's really meant for cells like alkaline or lithium primary cells that put out a full 1.5V. Sometimes such a device won't work as well from 1.2V rechargables like NiMH or NiCad. These cells will work better, but you'll need to be aware of key downsides:1) Because they output a full 1.5V steadily until fully discharged, there's no voltage dip for electronic gadgets to use to gauge battery charge remaining. So your device will appear fully-charged on these batteries 100% till cutout, which will be sudden and unexpected. Have a backup set ready!2) Because of (1), these cells are a little risky when used to power devices like digital recorders and cameras. They'll work, but because of the sudden cut-out when discharged, if you fail to stop your recording in the normal way beforehand, you may lose the /entire/ recording due to failure to write-out and close the recording file to the flash memory normally. For a still camera, this'll be just the last picture at cut-out, but for an audio or video recording, you might lose the whole recording. The risk can be minimized by timing the runtime in the device you get from the cells in a test-run first, then being careful to stop using the device in the field in sufficient time to save and close your recording before that time (being sure to adjust for extreme temperatures, which reduce capacity).3) These batteries work by using a micro-mini voltage convertor to step the cell's native 3.6V (4.2V - 3.0V) down to a fixed 1.5V output. A side effect of the convertor's operation is stray radio-frequency emission, some of which is conducted thru into the device being powered. If that device is a radio receiver, like a handheld scanner or FRS/GMRS handy-talkie, or similar, you can expect reduced receive performance.In testing with a handheld scanner I use to monitor operations at my local airport, I experienced a 50% reduction of sensitivity, and some low frequencies (e.g. the AM broadcast band) were lost in the RF noise from these cells entirely. This isn't a defect, it's just a side-effect of how the cells work. A battery-powered GPS device may also be affected, I tried them in a Garmin GPSmap 60CS 2-AA handheld GPS unit. They worked flawlessly for me here, with no reduction in satellite signal strength, but your device may vary and you could try it out first before going into the field. And again, there will be no warning prior to end-of-discharge cut-off, the GPS will appear ""fully charged"" the entire time.So what do I use them for? I have an LED flashlight that's super bright, but was designed for alkaline cells and would not get to full brightness on normal NiMH rechargeables. These cells work _perfectly_ there. The only remaining downside is limited cell capacity. From 2400 mAh NiMH cells, I'd get two hours continuous runtime, but these cells can only provide one hour (1200 mAh capacity). Again, that's simply a side effect of the design and isn't a defect.I also have a couple of fancy electronic flash units for my SLR camera, and these cells work extremely well in that device too!So, know your device and your application to decide if these cells are right for you. Most modern electronic gadgets like radio equipment or digital recording devices will be designed to operate just fine from 1.2V NiMH cells, and these won't harm the receive performance of a radio like these USB cells. Plus, you'll get proper charge-state indications from NiMH cells. Just remember to select and pack a quality NiMH charger in that case.",Andrew Skretvedt,4.0,6,2020,2020-06,"Works well, but understand what you're getting. These are novel and strange batteries.

I've only had to recharge them once so far.Because of the elastic band holding the cap on, it can be a little finicky to get them properly charging in the USB port, but since they illuminate when charging that's not much of an issue.The biggest downside that you might overlook is that any device you put these into can't know the charge level. So my wireless controllers won't warn me when they're low on battery anymore -- they just go from working well to flaking out when the batteries are low without much warning. Presumably this is because the voltage of these batteries as they discharge doesn't follow that of a typical alkaline battery (instead, the voltage is mostly constant throughout the discharge because of the circuitry that converts the 3.7 V of the lithium battery to the 1.5 V presented at the AA terminals, until it just completely drops out).",Colin Wallace,5.0,5,2020,2020-05,"They do what they claim to do Been using these for 6 months in my game controllers.

While I was initially pleased with the purchase, that pleasure unraveled in short order.The Good:The little rechargeable batteries feature a nifty ""flip cap"" design, exposing a standard-issue USB-A male connector (think: the tried and true USB connection type for desktop computers and wall chargers). They charge relatively quickly, and fit perfectly well in anything that accepts AA batteries.The Bad:TL;DR: they break. Very. Easily. The USB connector (not the battery top-style cap) breaks with very little provocation. On top of that, the actual innards of the lithium battery also come out of the metallic ""battery"" housing without much effort as well (say, when removing the battery from the port in which it's charging).

Probably anything else would be better.Pros: they are very light and definitely feel like lithium batteries.  The built in charger is a great concept.

My NiMH batteries on the other hand, read low charge pretty quick, but I always recharged them when they got low.  This time I let them go longer once they got low, and they lasted much longer than I thought they would.  So the NiMH fooled me into thinking they were out when they really were not.The test:  4 of these batteries (new) vs. 4 Panasonic Eneloop NiMH (about 2 years old) in my security camera.  I ignored the battery indicator and just waited until they die.  The lithium died after 12 days.  The NiMH went 11 days and were still working but I think they were about out since I think it was missing some night vision pics (I think the camera misses some night vision pics once it gets low).  And if the NiMH were new they would probably do better.The conclusion:  These don't seem any better than NiMH.  They cost about twice as much.

521,B085HB8QVX,AA,2020-08-06,Not Verified,nice batteries; charge cables are inefficient," I’ve used lots of rechargeable batteries over the years, including NiCad and NiMH batteries.  But I’ve started shifting to rechargeable lithium batteries because they hold a charge a lot longer than other rechargeable types can, especially when not in use for a long time.  They also tend not to develop a “memory” when charged frequently.This particular AA rechargeable battery set includes four AA lithium batteries, a plastic battery storage case, and two magnetic charge cables.  This set does not come with an AC-USB adapter.The magnetic charge cables are pretty interesting, although somewhat limited in utility.  Each cable has two heads, and each one magnetically attaches to the positive end of a battery and charges by USB.  The downside is it can only charge two batteries at a time, so you have to use both cables and tie up two separate USB ports to charge the four batteries.  The cables are also very short, so this method of charging is only useful if you’re charging them very close to a computer or USB charging hub.  This is not very efficient at all, although it may be a good solution for someone who travels and doesn’t want to lug around a typical box charger.  While charging, each magnetic head gives off a blue light that turns green when charging is complete.  It took several hours to fully charge the batteries.  Once charged, though, they work great in any device using AA batteries.Overall, this is a nice set of rechargeable batteries.  It’s an expensive set, but when you consider the cost of AA alkaline batteries these days, it should save a lot of money down the road, especially when used in battery hogs like toys, flashlights, and camera flash attachments.",Terry R.

621,B07R2KK5P7,AA,2020-02-24,Verified Purchase,I use these in my blink cams., I bought these because the price of lithium AA batteries is quite expensive and these are supposed to be rechargeable lithium AA replacements. They do work but they don’t have nearly the longevity one would expect. The thing about blink camera battery life is that they say it gives you two years on a set of batteries but realistically you’re lucky to get 2 to 7 days. Now I’ve had that limitation on longevity with the regular batteries and I have it even more so with these. There’s another site that are black and green that are also lithium AA that have a better life span as far as longevity goes. All that taken into consideration it’s still a good thing to have because otherwise you’re buying toss away the same AA batteries at 30+ dollars a 24 pack whereas for a similar amount of money you get for batteries that will be able to be used over and over more than six times probably a few hundred times. Even though they may not last as long as the throwaway set and you have to go around to replace them pretty regularly especially if you have your settings to record almost all the motion with a high sensitivity and a long clip blanks it’s still better to have these in my opinion. They do show up as needing to be To be replaced as soon as their inserted into the blink XT cameras and that kind of gives you a looksee into how they’re going to behave because they really don’t last all that long but it’s either that or throw away batteries every three days at the settings I have mine,Steven M.

I used an OPUS battery tester-charger in discharge-mode to measure the capacity and the AAA cells came out fairly consistent whether I drained them at 200mA rate or 500mA rate - very impressive maintaining 1.4V right up til the last moment even at the high discharge rate.  I could see this being useful in toys or camera flashes that may go hard on batteries and run out quickly.

704,B07R2KK5P7,AA,2019-09-17,Verified Purchase,Capacity Test and Technical Review," Fuvaly 1.5v Lithium AA 4x Rechargeable Batteries SummaryPros:* Lights are helpful* Very lightweight* 1.6v unloaded output voltage is great; 1.55v or higher, consistent and based on load* Stays coolCons:* Tested when new to 82.5% of stated capacity (1.857 Wh instead of 2.25 Wh), a little low but in the expected range* Almost no warning when out of power. Cannot be used in critical devices where power cannot be lost.* More expensive than 1.2v NiMHBackgroundMy intended use for these is for wireless Xbox controllers (2 AA) and wireless Oculus touch controllers (1 AA).I have been using high capacity rechargeable NMHi 1.2v AA batteries for a couple years in the XBox controllers. I've tried two models, a 2800mah kind and 2500 mah turnigy brand, marked as low self-discharge.I tested the capacity of these NmHi batteries which were good, however my xbox never showed a full battery, even when freshly recharged, and it would warn for some time that the battery was low. It was good to get the warning and have more use before having to swap them (days of use), but I felt I never got enough life out of these batteries. The 2500 mah Turnigy brand seemed to last longer than the larger capacity ones because they seemed to hold a high voltage. In the oculus it was the same, where some fresh batteries were immediately detected as low.It is true that alkaline batteries start at 1.5v but quickly drop voltage and spend more of their life at 1.3v and 1.2v, and that is why rechargeables match that voltage, but I wanted to try a battery that sustained a higher voltage and see if they provided more ""usable"" power.I chose these Fuvaly because they were the ONLY AA Lithium on amazon who posted details such as discharge rates. I saw these are not a good fit for high discharge rate devices such as camera flashes and some toys like RC vehicles. Having an indicator light and a charge port are superior to batteries where one must remove and replace batteries to reset them and there is no indicator that says what the battery is doing (on or off or charging).Capacity TestI performed a discharge test on standard 4 button charger of a single cell using 0.4a discharge rate, which should last two or three hours. I was happy to see the voltage was a high and consistent based on load for the duration of the test. 1.56v for 0.4a. After it shut off, I let it settle a little and tried to get more out but there was nothing left.I got a total 1.857 Wh of energy out. This is 82.5% of the reported 2.25 Wh capacity. Instead of the reported 1500 mah at 1.5v, I got 1238 mah.This is an expected result due to efficiency loss of the step down conversion, and use of cheap components. I did expect a little better efficiency because the battery must have a 3.7v nominal voltage and output requires only a step down (not a boost converter). Also I did not feel any heat during discharge; that means little loss to heat and it is likely the underlying battery capacity less than 2.25 Wh.I did not test the maximum discharge rate.The good news is the unloaded voltage targets 1.6v, not 1.5v; the voltage dips relative to the load and stays consistent. This means under load the voltage is well above 1.5v. Providing power at a high voltage helps with efficiency.When power runs out on a single cell, the voltage drops to about 1.2v for only 10 seconds or so before completely shutting off. This means electronics get almost no warning when they are out of battery, and the battery and the device will shut off with almost no warning compared to 1.2v NmHi rechargeables. This is compounded when using two or more of these in the same device; the device will be shut off when any one battery is drained. Do not use these batteries in critical devices such as a transmitter for radio controlled aircraft; they will shut off without warning.Charges at 0.36a at 5v, or 1.8 Watts.I did not open the cell but I suspect it is a 1S 600mah Lithium ion polymer battery.  These typically discharge at 5% a month and have a charge shelf life of 300 days.For the best care, do not leave the batteries at a low state; charge them immediately if drained. For slightly longer life, if you are storing them, they are better stored at 35% to 55% capacity or so (50%), not at a full charge. However if you charge them, they will lose 5% a month so it's a good compromise between being ready and storage voltage.Do not charge lithium batteries unattended; use a fire-safe surface such as granite counter top or cement floor; if they become very hot to the touch during charging or discharging, remove them. Recycle them at batteries plus or other store.I will revise my review after more use in devices.Recommendations:* To those who designed and created this: thank you for sharing detailed specifications. Thank you for the lights and physical design and on off behavior.* More capacity would always be welcomed.* These batteries would be perfect if you changed the circuit programming to provide a longer warning voltage time period when the battery is nearly drained. -- Especially under lower loads, there should be 5 or 10 minutes of warning, say at 1.22v. Under moderate loads, there should be a minimum 2 minute warning low voltage. I would prefer this to be longer so that as the battery ages, and gets worse, the warning system would still be ample.

Color of battery is white with blue label.Summary: Mostly positive except 2 minor cons.Con first.1. The AAA battery length is 0.5mm to 1mm too long.It nearly doesn't fit my PIR night light. If you slant the AAA, completely, to slide in, won't do. My way, very snug fit: Slant just enough to compress the negative connector spring. Hold the compression then push down on the positive side. Other method: Thin out the plastic plates on ends of the battery compartment, especially the negative spring connector side.2. You can buy about 64 premium alkaline AAA for its price. That is a lot of alkaline batteries. The good is environmental: less waste: 64xAAA garbage!3. Because of built-in switching regulator circuit, it is electrically noisier than alkaline battery. Try it out on your audio and other devices. It may not have ill effect. The device may have good filter circuit.Pro:1. 1.5V constant until 'empty'!  (99+% of others, Voltage will fall.)It has buck (step-down) switching regulator in it (from 3.6V to 1.5V, regulated).Most alkaline types, 1.5V falls to 1V when in use. So the Watt-hour is much less impressive as claimed in terms of Ampere-hour. Watt-hour= IxVxTime, or IxIxRxTime, where the load is a constant resistor.On some applications, 1.2V is the low limit. If NiCd, NMH are used here, full charge 1.26V will easily reach 1.2V fast.  The claimed Ampere-hour is 60% or more useless. On some modern devices, like MS mouse, the limit is 1V. (I measured it.) It is a better application for NMH battery types. But falling from 1.26V to 1V is still too fast. So, alkaline AAA 'lasts' at least 50% longer than NMH, even if same Ampere-hour rating.2. Include hydra charge cable (1-to-4 micro-USB cable)3. Inside the AAA is also charge-control/protection circuit. Can safely charge with ubiquitous micro-USB 5V cellphone charger.4.

754,B085FZFVQV,AA,2020-07-25,Verified Purchase,Even better than advertised,"  So far I've been very impressed by these batteries. Shipping was fast, packaging is good. I tried out both the magnetic charging and the 5V standard charger. The listing says that the magnetic charger will charge in about an hour and a half. The first battery was complete in about an hour and the second right under 1.5 hours. The two I put on the standard charger were done in about 2 hours. The lighting system for the batteries is really easy to understand, although a bit inconsistent; the magnetic charger is blue during charging and green when charged while the standard charger has a red light with flashing blue during charging and a solid green when charged. Still easy to understand though. Haven't had a lot of time to test these batteries out. I have a high powered LED flashlight that burns through batteries pretty quickly and have it on continuously just to see how long they'll last. So far they're going surprisingly long. This set didn't come with the AC plug - would be nice to see that as an option in the past, but I had a multi-USB charge adapter that worked fine with these and probably most people do as well.",Ben Montgomery,5.0,7,2020,2020-07,"Even better than advertised  So far I've been very impressed by these batteries.

This is my first time buying rechargeable batteries and I'm settled on using them from now on. It's so much more convenient whereas I can recharge them once they're dead. The charging time is also really fast and they last long before having to be charged again. My daughter really likes them and so far they've been working well with her lights. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy batteries.,Tony,5.0,5,2020,2020-05,GREAT PRODUCT! I bought these batteries for my daughter's LED lights and so far they are working great.

836,B07F27PK2M,AA,2020-01-04,Verified Purchase,They haven't refined the circuitry enough- devices won't always accept them," For those of you that don't know how this works, lithium batteries have a ~3.5 volt nominal charge depending on type and a much greater variance in voltage between charged and discharged states. In order for them to work in place of a 1.5 volt alkaline AA battery, they have to have an onboard voltage regulator to convert the voltage as well as control the USB charging functionality as lithium chemistry needs safety monitoring when charging. This presents several issues. Firstly your device sees the battery at a constant 1.5 volt charge, which makes it think that the batteries are full the entire charge cycle until the onboard converter cuts out on minimum safety (yet another quirk with lithium, they are unsafe to charge ever again if they drop below a minimum safe voltage) and your device goes dead without warning. The second issue is that I am fairly certain the converter goes into a sleep state when it doesn't recognize a load so that it doesn't waste power. This presents an issue for a lot of more intelligent devices that go through a rapid self test when you turn them on. In the case of my old Pentax DSLR it registers that the battery is dead, the indicator flashes and refuses to boot when you turn it on. I have tested all batteries involved with a volt meter, everything registers as a near perfect 1.5 V but their onboard circuitry clashes with the check in my device. The lesson is if you buy these you cannot take for granted that they will work in anything you have. It will actually have very mixed results.",WRPSD,2.0,1,2020,2020-01,"They haven't refined the circuitry enough- devices won't always accept them For those of you that don't know how this works, lithium batteries have a ~3.5 volt nominal charge depending on type and a much greater variance in voltage between charged and discharged states.

Keypad battery life is about 2 months. So the lithiums are lasting longer than rayovac alkaline cells. Highly recommended!  Still lost a star due to port potwntial damage.  /Update***I have an electronic door lock (keypad) that loves to eat batteries (4xAA), and tired of changing / throwing away batteries every 3-4 weeks.  Tried NiCD and NiMH, but terminal voltage is too low and makes the lock think that batteries are exhausted very quickly.  Lithium AA batteries work pretty well, but cost quite a bit more than alklaline and are not rechargeable.  Found these, and with a regulated 1.5v output, pack should always be a consistent voltage despite last time they were charged.  When the batteries need recharging, can just pop out and plug in.  Easier said than done.  The charge ports require precise alignment with the ""charge cable harness"", I can see that inattention or carelessness can cause the ports to break.  That is only complaint.  Batteries have  been in place for about 2 weeks now, and are showing great potential for this particular use.

Keypad battery life is about 2 months. So the lithiums are lasting longer than rayovac alkaline cells. Highly recommended!  Still lost a star due to port potwntial damage.  /Update***I have an electronic door lock (keypad) that loves to eat batteries (4xAA), and tired of changing / throwing away batteries every 3-4 weeks.  Tried NiCD and NiMH, but terminal voltage is too low and makes the lock think that batteries are exhausted very quickly.  Lithium AA batteries work pretty well, but cost quite a bit more than alklaline and are not rechargeable.  Found these, and with a regulated 1.5v output, pack should always be a consistent voltage despite last time they were charged.  When the batteries need recharging, can just pop out and plug in.  Easier said than done.  The charge ports require precise alignment with the ""charge cable harness"", I can see that inattention or carelessness can cause the ports to break.  That is only complaint.  Batteries have  been in place for about 2 weeks now, and are showing great potential for this particular use.

1119,B0828KRQZ3,Other,2020-06-28,Verified Purchase,Finally a decent rechargeable!!," I’ve been waiting for a true 1.5 volt AA rechargeable battery all my life.  I was pretty excited for these when I saw them. In the past you had rechargeable AA’s but they where only 1.2v and not very high capacity.  Then lithium came along, but they where all 3.7 volt. You could make that work on some things using a blank “dummy” battery but the voltages still weren’t right and if your device takes 6 batteries there’s no way to get the voltage close using dummy batteries with those..  but then these batteries can along and solved all those problems. My main use for them is in my hands free stainless garbage can. It has a motion sensor and opens when your hand is near it and runs on 6 AA batteries. I would go through batteries every 1.5 months and it seemed like a real waste to me. The new EBL Lithium rechargeable batteries lasted 1 month and 10 days before needing recharged, so maybe a week less than conventional alkaline batteries. The one big difference I noticed though was these batteries worked strong right up to the point they were dead and could no longer open the lid.  Alkaline batteries lasted slightly longer, but with degraded operation for the last week or so which gave plenty of warning the batteries where going dead. I assume this has to do with the internal circuitry that protects the batteries from voltage dropping too low.  The best part is when the batteries go dead they charge up in an hour or two (not sure exactly as I walked out of the room).  I waited a month to review this so I could see how they compared with alkaline batteries and in my personal application I can say I am very happy with them.

They claim to hold a constant voltage across their entire charge cycle, and I can easily put that to the test right off the bat.  An Alkaline battery cell is 1.5V.  Most rechargeable AA batteries are Nickel-Metal Hydride (NIMH), which only has a 1.2V cell.  I’m going to scrutinize these with my multimeter to see how they hold up.The first thing I did upon receiving this package was test the voltage of all the batteries.  They were all very near 1.49V.  I then put them on the charger, and it took approximately 95 minutes to achieve a full charge so I know they didn’t have much juice originally.  These batteries are consistently showing a voltage very close to 1.49V.  I’ve included a photo of my multimeter reading 1.491V and the average voltage I’m reading across all four batteries is 1.493V.  Fortunately, there’s no discernible difference between these batteries at a full charge, or at a low charge.  Whereas an alkaline battery will start with 1.5-1.6V and the voltage gradually diminishes, this one seems to run at 100% voltage up until the end of its life.  I’m very happy with my initial tests on these batteries.  The output voltage is constant and essentially perfect at damn near exactly 1.5V, far better than a 1.2V NIMH rechargeable battery. I even had one read exactly 1.5V (pictured).As others here have pointed out most AA battery brands advertise their life in milliamp hours, but this advertises itself in milliwatt hours.  So the 3300 mWh converts to 2200 mAh.  (3300 mWh / 1.5V = 2200 mAh)  This isn’t a problem with the battery per se, just the marketing.I purchased these a bit experimentally.  I’m an electrician.  After burning up a few too many AAs and AAAs on some of my less-powerful battery operated tools, I’ve been looking into getting rechargeables.  I was primarily intrigued by the high capacity, the constant voltage, and the quick and easy recharge of these.  I also needed to be able to recharge these quickly with or without access to power, as I can do courtesy of my Makita ADP05 (pictured).

But storage capacity is misleading, It's in Mwh instead of the standard Mah"," I really like this battery because its 1.5v, it's Lithium, so you're getting all the power instead of another other than die off as you use them. But the capacity is misleading.It's listed as 3300 MWh, while the standard EBL rechargeable is 2800 MAh. The capacity of the lithium battery is 2/3 the standard rechargeable battery at only 2200 mah.So they are great if you need something with extra power like audio equipment or something sensitive or more powerful. For regular use, the regular rechargeable aa EBL battery is better because the capacity is 1/3 larger.I ran by sons hot wheel track with these at the Standard EBL's ran for 4hrs23min. The lithium EBL Rechargeable lasted for almost 2hrs. It ran those motors SO SO fast, which is fantastic, but the run time, in reality, was less than 1/2.I recharged and tested them a few times and got the same results.

But the capacity is misleading.It's listed as 3300 MWh, while the standard EBL rechargeable is 2800 MAh. The capacity of the lithium battery is 2/3 the standard rechargeable battery at only 2200 mah.So they are great if you need something with extra power like audio equipment or something sensitive or more powerful. For regular use, the regular rechargeable aa EBL battery is better because the capacity is 1/3 larger.I ran by sons hot wheel track with these at the Standard EBL's ran for 4hrs23min. The lithium EBL Rechargeable lasted for almost 2hrs. It ran those motors SO SO fast, which is fantastic, but the run time, in reality, was less than 1/2.I recharged and tested them a few times and got the same results.

1214,B0821ZNWKW,AA,2020-01-26,Not Verified,"Clever design, very different from other rechargeables"," There are one or two things about these that I think could have been done better, but these are some of the best rechargeable AA batteries I’ve ever used.  Normal, non-rechargeable AA batteries put out 1.5 volts.  For some reason that I’ve never understood rechargeable batteries, whether they’re NiCad, NiMh, and even the ultra popular Enloops only put out 1.2 volts.  Now most devices are designed to operate on less voltage than the combined total of the batteries they take, but not all of them.  The ones that are actually expecting the full voltage tend to react either by drawing more current from the batteries to compensate and making the rechargeable batteries last half as long, or malfunctioning in a variety of ways.  The Blackube rechargeables are the first I’ve ever used that actually put out the same 1.5 volts as a standard AA.The full voltage aspect is probably these can’t be recharged with a normal AA battery charger.  They have a micro USB port instead.  This has the advantage that you done actually need a separate device to charge them.  The 4-pack comes with a 4-way charging cable, however the carrying case only has room for the batteries not the cable, so it might be easy to accidentally separate them.  If you lose the cable, you can still use any old micro USB cable to charge them, but only one battery per cable at a time.The capacity on these is really impressive.  I’ve been using a pair in my XBONE controller and after 12 hours of play time they still show as 100% charged.These are by far my favorite rechargeables because they’re compatible with devices that are traditionally not compatible with rechargeables (because of the goofy 1.2V vs 1.5V thing), they recharge very quickly on a quick charger circuit and they have an amazing amount of capacity.",Samson Wick,5.0,1,2020,2020-01,"Clever design, very different from other rechargeables There are one or two things about these that I think could have been done better, but these are some of the best rechargeable AA batteries I’ve ever used.

So I used my battery tester on all four and one obviously doesn't work.I contacted Amazon Chat about the issue and they just gave me a full refund and told me I could keep the three that worked. I needed four to work for what I was going to use them for, but I guess I will hold onto the three for now.Again, other batteries from this company have worked great, but the AAAs just need better quality control I think."

They take a long time to charge and they slowly fade away. Not great for devices that use 3 batteries. Or something that you need to supply with a constant high power. I bought a bunch of these for use in under cabinet lighting, and aquarium gravel vac, and my wireless weather station. The under cabinet lighting, just sucks batteries dry. And these are no different, in fact in that application they don't last nearly as long as alkaline or NiMH. But they do stay brighter longer. The gravel vac is the same situation. The fade of power made it frustrating to use. These are constant. Full suction all the time. If they do die, there's just no suction at all. It's a very clear indicator. And charging doesn't take 8 hours. plug these into a USB port and they are good in an hour or two. Finally, the weather station. It seems like those batteries are always freezing and dying or over heating and dying. These are less sensitive to temperature swings. And recharging 3 of these batteries is so much easier. I don't have to cycle them through the charger like I would the NiMHs. NiMHs don't like it when you pair a dead battery with a fully charged one. These don't care. You can charge 1 or 3 no problem.I'd love to see a longer run time but the charging convenience and steady power more than make up for their weaknesses.One thing I would really love to see is a double length battery.

1462,B07MWYYDTM,Other,2019-06-02,Verified Purchase,Good 1.5V batteries for voltage picky devices," I have been wanting to get something like these for a while and they work great for my use case. You may ask, why would anyone pay $10 for a single AA cell? Why wouldn't you just get a cheaper NiMH cell and call it a day? The answer to this is simple: There are devices I own that are just not designed to operate at lower voltages. When I go on business trips, two things really matter to me -- my portable water flosser and my wireless mouse for my laptop. Problem with NiMH is that while it is fully charged at 1.5V, their voltages quickly drop down to the 1.25-1.3V range soon after they are being used or have been sitting around for a while. This means a much weaker pressure on my water flosser and a choppy Bluetooth connection for my wireless mouse. Charging my NiMHs every so often has gotten to be such a chore that I have decided I would pay up for these cells instead which can keep a consistent voltage over time.Although the concept of lithium-ion USB AA cells is not new (there are plenty out of products out there), this is one of the highest rated capacities that can be found on Amazon. All of these cells work by enclosing a lithium-based battery inside an AA enclosure and using a small chip built into the + terminal of the battery to convert and regulate the output voltage. The circuit also regulates charging and the discharging of the built-in lithium battery to prevent over(dis)charging.Here are my thoughts on these batteries:Style/Design: These look exactly like your traditional AA batteries, with the exception that there is a built-in micro USB port on top of each battery (as opposed to other designs that have this on the side). The battery seems sturdy and in one piece. It does not appear that it would suffer from the drop issue that other designs face with the circuitry falling off when dropped. There is also a charging indicator light that turns red when the battery is being charged and turns off when the charging is complete. The enclosed 4-in-1 cable is quite handy so you can simply use one cable to charge 4 batteries at once without having to use a USB hub or 4 separate cables.Weight: Since lithium-based batteries have higher energy densities, the battery is significantly lighter when compared to a 2,400mAh LSD NiMH. One of these cells weighed 20g while the NiMH based cell weighed 29g.Voltage Stability Under Load: When the batteries are not subject to a load, they measure around 1.51-1.53V. When placed under load, the voltage drops are as follows:250mA: 1.46V500mA: 1.41V750mA: 1.38V1A: 1.34V1.25A: 1.30V1.5A: 1.24V1.75A: 1.22V2A: 1.20V2.15A: 1.18VBeyond ~2.2A, the current limiter kicks in and no further increase in current is possible, even in the case of a short circuit. When measured with a multimeter under a short-circuit condition, the maximum acquired current was 2.21A. I am not quite sure how the manufacturer was able to achieve 4A of current on these cells, but it is possible that they were testing a set of 2 batteries being operated in parallel.Compared to an LSD NiMH cell, voltage drops on these batteries are steeper in the short term, however, these cells can provide approximately the same voltage until the whole cell is depleted (i.e. until the under-voltage protection IC kicks in for the lithium cell).Discharging Test: A discharge test was done for these batteries under 2A, 1A, 500mA, and 250mA conditions. The results are as follows:2A: Runtime: 44m 35s - Capacity: 1,485mAh (87.35%) - Power: 1,904mWh (74.67%)1A: Runtime: 1h 34m 20s - Capacity: 1,573mAh (92.53%) - Power: 2,210mWh (86.67%)500mA: Runtime: 3h 15m 28s - Capacity: 1,615mAh (95%) - Power: 2,362mWh (92.63%)250mA: Runtime: 6h 22m 45s - Capacity: 1,584mAh (89.49%) - Power: 2,216mWh (86.90%)It seems like the converter was the most efficient when the current draw was around 500mA when both the capacity and the power ratings have a 90+% match compared to the numbers on the label. The voltage was fairly consistent through all the current tests and does not ""curve"" downward like traditional batteries as they are being discharged. Instead, the battery experiences an abrupt drop to zero voltage when the cell is depleted (shut off due to the under-voltage protection IC kicking in for the built-in lithium cell battery). Because the voltage stays constant throughout the whole discharge cycle, it is not possible to gauge battery capacity based on the terminal voltage (it will always read around 1.51-1.53V when measured without load, or 0V when depleted).Charging Test: Charging these batteries using my battery pack, which outputs a USB voltage of around 5.3V, the charging process took 1h 55m. This was quite on point with quoted 2h timeframe from the manufacturer (the charging time may be closer to 2h exactly for USB power sources that are lower than 5.3V, although the difference would most likely be nominal). The charging process was split into two phases, a constant-current phase which drew a constant current of about 0.42A, and a constant-voltage phase as the lithium cell becomes full. The constant-current phase lasted 1h and 30m and the constant-voltage phase continued for another 22m until the current was cut off once the USB charging current reached 50mA (the charging light turns off at this point).When charging 4 batteries at once using the same cable, the current may approach 1.7A during the constant-current phase. This may cause some problems when charging from the computer USB's port since even the USB 3.0 spec only allows up to 900mA of current for unconfigured devices (newer DCP ports allow 1.5A of current). To avoid overcurrent issues, it is best to charge all 4 batteries using a charger that has at least 2A of available power.Ripple Test: Since the battery uses a converter chip to convert the internal voltage from the nominal voltage of 3.7V down to 1.5V, it impacts a ripple ""fluctuating"" voltage on the battery output terminals. When the battery was not under any load, the ripple was 12.17Hz @ 27.60mV Vpp (most likely in power saving PFM mode). Putting the battery across a 5Ω resistor (~300mA current) resulted in a different ripple pattern that was of higher frequency that was 1.023Mhz @ 12.60mV Vpp. This level of ripple is low and should not be problematic for devices running on these batteries.Shelf-Life: Since this battery relies on a converter chip that is always-on, it will use a minuscule amount of power to perform this conversion even when no load is attached. Assuming the chip draws about 25µA of power when there is no current load, the battery should last about 3 years before it is fully depleted. This should not be a problem if the batteries are actively being used and recharged, although letting the batteries sit idle without being charged for 3 or more years may result in irreversible cell damage (I assume that's why the manufacturer stated that the service life is 3 years). Devices that draw a small ghost load may kick the battery out of the power saving mode and lead to faster energy depletion. That being said, the cell will most likely run out of energy due to this load much quicker than this quiescent load.Overall, these batteries are great. Although they are much more expensive than other batteries out there, they serve my purposes quite well and I am very happy with them. For high current applications though, using NiMH cells may be more appropriate since they have higher energy overall, cheaper, and can easily tolerate 5A or more of current.",David L,4.0,6,2019,2019-06,"Good 1.5V batteries for voltage picky devices I have been wanting to get something like these for a while and they work great for my use case. You may ask, why would anyone pay $10 for a single AA cell? Why wouldn't you just get a cheaper NiMH cell and call it a day? The answer to this is simple: There are devices I own that are just not designed to operate at lower voltages. When I go on business trips, two things really matter to me -- my portable water flosser and my wireless mouse for my laptop.

1521,B07MWYYDTM,AAA,2019-02-19,Verified Purchase,Failed to light flashlight.," Got these primarily to use with my favorite three-mode, zoom, AAA flashlight.  Unfortunately, the light doesn't function with these Blackubes.  Light works well with NiMH (EBL) rechargeable as well as with Li-Ion (Energizer) non-rechargeables, but flashes for a split second and dies on Blackubes.Most devices are designed to operate at 1.5V and these Blackubes are 1.5V.  The alternative rechargeable is NiMH 1.2V, 25% less than Li-Ion and Alkaline.  But voltage is only half the story, Ampacity (or Amp-capacity) is the other half.  The power (energy) of a battery is Volts x Amps.  Most devices operate in a band of voltage (e.g. 0.9V -- 1.7V), so a battery that starts at 1.5 might be expected to operate better over it's wider usable voltage range?Energy calculated from published specs:  Volts  AmpHr  Energy  Diameter  1.5V  0.6 Ahr  0.9 Whr  0.399""  Blackube AAA  - *Failed to light flashlight  1.2V  1.2 Ahr  1.4 Whr  0.403""  EBL AAA  1.5V  1.2 Ahr  1.8 Whr  0.405""  Energizer Ult AAABut this chart doesn't tell the whole story.  First, Blackube fails to light the flashlight, so it's useless.  But, let's assume Blackube fixes their battery and someday functions properly?  It's still low on the energy chart.  Better voltage, but worse Ampacity.  Knew this going in, but wanted to test the spec'd better voltage range to see whether those extra 0.3V at the top added more operating headroom?There are also advantages to charging from a standard USB.  EBL NiMH require a charging station, weighing several ounces.  Blackube requires only a few-gram standard USB cable.  This alone could make Blackube worth carrying - if they lit the flashlight?It should be noted the flashlight operates at 70mA on the other two battery's, regardless input voltage (above 0.9V).  There is an unused high-mode at 150 mA and an unused flashing mode at 70mA (which surely pulses 150 mA at 50% duty-cycle).

Light works well with NiMH (EBL) rechargeable as well as with Li-Ion (Energizer) non-rechargeables, but flashes for a split second and dies on Blackubes.Most devices are designed to operate at 1.5V and these Blackubes are 1.5V.  The alternative rechargeable is NiMH 1.2V, 25% less than Li-Ion and Alkaline.  But voltage is only half the story, Ampacity (or Amp-capacity) is the other half.  The power (energy) of a battery is Volts x Amps.  Most devices operate in a band of voltage (e.g. 0.9V -- 1.7V), so a battery that starts at 1.5 might be expected to operate better over it's wider usable voltage range?Energy calculated from published specs:  Volts  AmpHr  Energy  Diameter  1.5V  0.6 Ahr  0.9 Whr  0.399""  Blackube AAA  - *Failed to light flashlight  1.2V  1.2 Ahr  1.4 Whr  0.403""  EBL AAA  1.5V  1.2 Ahr  1.8 Whr  0.405""  Energizer Ult AAABut this chart doesn't tell the whole story.  First, Blackube fails to light the flashlight, so it's useless.  But, let's assume Blackube fixes their battery and someday functions properly?  It's still low on the energy chart.  Better voltage, but worse Ampacity.  Knew this going in, but wanted to test the spec'd better voltage range to see whether those extra 0.3V at the top added more operating headroom?There are also advantages to charging from a standard USB.  EBL NiMH require a charging station, weighing several ounces.  Blackube requires only a few-gram standard USB cable.  This alone could make Blackube worth carrying - if they lit the flashlight?It should be noted the flashlight operates at 70mA on the other two battery's, regardless input voltage (above 0.9V).  There is an unused high-mode at 150 mA and an unused flashing mode at 70mA (which surely pulses 150 mA at 50% duty-cycle).  Blackube failed in these unused modes as well."

1539,B07MWYYDTM,Other,2018-12-30,Verified Purchase,Good performance except for capacity," I purchased a set of 4 AA cells for use in wireless mics. Wanting to know how long a charge would last, I constructed a test fixture with a 15 ohm load (100 mA at 1.5 V). Although the specified capacity of these cells is 1,250 mAh, they only produced 657, 1,054, 1,100 and 1,112 mAh. These results are repeatable and sub-par. Might this be an indicator of other quality deficiencies? Other than capacity the cells performed well, maintaining a constant 1.5 V output until they drop abruptly to 0 V when depleted. This being the case, the device they power will not give a low battery warning - it will just stop working. These units incorporate a rechargeable lithium cell, recharging circuit and output voltage regulator within the profile of a AA package. The voltage regulator apparently cuts out if overloaded, preventing damage to the lithium cell. The series regulator inherently produces heat proportional to load current, explaining why some users reported heating. Unfortunately, maximum load current is not specified. I like the design because it provides the full 1.5 V required to operate my wireless mics and would probably give it 5 stars if they met their specified capacity.",fixitrite,3.0,12,2018,2018-12,"Good performance except for capacity I purchased a set of 4 AA cells for use in wireless mics.

I went through the process to get a refund and ended up having to chat with an Amazon customer rep that issued a refund.  I reordered and received the next order in the promised time. I am writing this review for the AAA set of batteries.  I ordered 4 because that's how many i needed.  When I installed them in my device it would not power on.  My next step was to charge them.  So I got out my volt meter to be on the safe side to check voltage to see why they needed charging.  I tested the voltage and 3 of the 4 tested at just over 1.5 volts.  The problem was the 4th battery that tested at just over 4 volts.  The batteries didn't need charging at all.  I have 1 battery that was not quality checked before it left the factory and was dangerously over voltage for an AAA battery.  The batteries charge well so far.  Because of the lack of in house quality control, I can not give this product more than 3 stars.  I will update this review once I have contacted the seller and try to resolve the 4th battery.  I also purchased at the same time the AA batteries and will test and review them soon.Update:  I have changed the rating from 3 to 4 stars.  I am in the process of monitoring these batteries.  In my original review, one of the 4 batteries was over voltage.  I charged it one cycle, retested it fresh off the charge and it was still over voltage at 4.03 volts.  I decided to let it rest for 2 hours to stabilize after charging and retested it.  To my amazement, it tested 1.533 volts.  I installed it with the other 3 in my appliance and it worked fine.  I will continue to monitor these regularly to insure that they remain in specs.

One outlet will charge all four of them and they neatly indicate that they are still charging with a fierce red light and will then go dark once full.You have to charge them via the USB - the LiPo charger will not understand how to charge them and perhaps even damage them. They charge quite linearly. You can do half full in some 40 minutes.The energy content is not great and the seller also makes no such claims. They hold .4Ah over 1..5V, some 2100 joules.They do self-discharge rather swiftly, so the ""pre-charged"" claim will be 80% untrue by the time you get them.They are hence best suitable for heavy use on the go or for constant use. Don't use them to save battery cost on your Bose headset unless you use it all the time.The light indicator is really neat. It's so bright you can operate the batteries in complete darkness, outdoors or aboard a plane. They have good low tolerances and are all quite equal in charge time and capacity.

While it is ""convenient"" to be able to charge them with a USB without the need for an actual battery charger; they are also inconvenient to charge when you need to charge all 4.The capacity is also very low for a rechargeable AA at only 1200mah.I charged these batteries for 12+ hours (the lights on them never seem to turn off even when they are charged) and when I put them into a remote control car; they only lasted around 20 minutes before the car was low on battery.Overall this is a disappointing turnout as my conventional rechargeable last for 1.5 hours.The other issue is with charging all 4 batteries at once; you need 4 wall chargers or one charger with 4 ports to use to charge.I think I will end up using them for wall clocks or something where the power draw is low and I rarely will have to charge them (or so I hope).If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful!

1791,B086L3Q8YX,Other,2019-12-29,Not Verified,Not Quite Up To Specs," When it comes to physics, you don't get something for nothing. This has always been the case with rechargeable batteries which have tried to replace standard alkaline batteries. While companies have tried in the past to make rechargeable batteries that were the same size as AA alkaline batteries, there is always some kind of compromise. With older Ni-Cad rechargeable batteries the voltage was always far less than 1.5 Volts, the amount of time they lasted was always shorter and they would only recharge a few dozen times before they had to be thrown away.These new rechargeable batteries  use Lithium as their storage medium and while they do last far longer than their Ni-Cad counterparts, they still have a problem with not delivering the minimum 1.5 Volts that Alkaline batteries do. To be sure, they are much better than Ni-Cads, but the highest voltage that I could charge these batteries to was about 1.45 Volts. Although AA Alkaline batteries state that they run 1.5 Volts, the average AA battery produces around 1.64 Volts when they are brand new.While these voltage numbers do not sound like a huge difference, some very sensitive electronics are not ""fooled"" by the lower voltages and will not work correctly, if at all. If you are using batteries to run something very simple like a motor or a flashlight you will likely not notice any difference in performance other than that the motor may run slightly slower or the light may shine a little less brighter. If you are using these batteries to run something like a GPS receiver or a medical device the problem could be a bit more serious though.While these batteries come much, much closer to replacing disposable alkaline batteries than ever before, the technology is still not 100% there. For many simple devices these batteries are perfectly acceptable though.",All American Reviews,4.0,12,2019,2019-12,"Not Quite Up To Specs When it comes to physics, you don't get something for nothing.

These are rated for 1000 cycles. This 4 pack could ultimately replace 4000 AA alkaline batteries. That is a ton of money saved.

Since the batteries are a bit thicker than a USB cord, you can't plug them into ports next to each other on a multi-port plug (at least not the one I use).

I then used 2 of them and they lasted about as long as a normal generic battery (around 20 hours).  I used a different set of batteries for the rest of the week, as I wanted to see if the others held a charge.  Upon placing the batteries back into the controller after a week of sitting around, I saw only a small degradation this time around (batteries didn't last quite as long, about 16 hours).  This batch out performed the initial batteries I received.  This review takes the following into account:The price of the batteries vs. the performance of the product. (I equate these to a set of how a generic battery would perform since it is over half the price of other USB batteries out there).Charge seemed to retain longer than the previous set that was sent.The charging time was my mistake.  These state that it should take about 4 hours to charge, so that is the norm for these batteries.The superb customer service I received.  I was contacted immediately about my initial score, and they asked to send replacement batteries to test (on their dime).  They initially sent the incorrect battery (AAA vs. AA).  I told them they sent the wrong battery and they quickly shipped out a replacement AA set.Used for my Xbox One controller.Pros:PriceIf charging batteries and using right away, they seem to work about as long as regular generic batteries.Con: If charging the batteries and storing for later use, the charge degrades within approximately one week, and will have to be recharged.The time to charge the batteries seems to fluctuate.

1852,B0824WB5ST,Other,2020-07-07,Verified Purchase,Super versatile set of rechargeable batteries," This brand of rechargeable batteries has a few different sets, I went with the mix of 2 AAA, and 2 AA's which seemed to be the most versatile since the AAA size comes with an adapter to fit in AA if I need more AA's.Note that the AAA is smaller in 600 mWh capacity than the larger AA (1500 mWh) but that's the tradeoff in versatility with the size coverage. Also the AAA ones need a micro USB cable to charge (the set comes with a single USB cable split to 4 micro usb heads which more than covers the 2 included AAA batteries.The coolest feature that attracted me to these batteries was the AA heads come off and become a regular USB male plug that can go directly into any USB port like on a computer and charge directly without needing a separate cable or charger. This feature makes these so convenient as I don't have many devices that need batteries and didn't want the extra clutter of having a separate charger.I purchased these mainly for use with my Oculus Quest controllers which eat batteries very quickly, and so far the battery life even with the AAA's (on AA adapter) has lasted as long as the disposable AA batteries I had been going through. The investment in these batteries should more than pay off as I continue to use the Oculus, and even when I run into emergency needs for various controllers and remotes that run out.So far I'm really happy with these and hope that they continue to hold charge as they have been solid in a several days of continuous use.",Joffrey,5.0,7,2020,2020-07,"Super versatile set of rechargeable batteries This brand of rechargeable batteries has a few different sets, I went with the mix of 2 AAA, and 2 AA's which seemed to be the most versatile since the AAA size comes with an adapter to fit in AA if I need more AA's.Note that the AAA is smaller in 600 mWh capacity than the larger AA (1500 mWh) but that's the tradeoff in versatility with the size coverage.

1863,B0824WB5ST,AAA,2020-06-28,Not Verified,Review of both AA and AAA options," I acquired both the AA and AAA options of these batteries. They differ slightly in that the AAA is charged using an included USB adapter (Micro-USB) that plugs into all 4 batteries, whereas the AA battery plugs directly into a USB-A port. While there’s no need for the adapter on the AA, note that each battery requires its own USB-A port (so charging 4 at a time means you need 4 open ports). Because the AAA uses an adapter, you only need one open USB-A port to charge all 4 at once.Both batteries have a built-in light that blinks when charging. Once the blinking stops, you know the batteries are full. A minor difference, but the AAA has a green light whereas the AA a red one.Note that neither battery came with a wall charger. You will need your own source. I tested different options to see if any had issues. First, I used my fast charger from my OnePlus 7 Pro phone. Then I used an older (slow) wall charger for my Apple iPad. Finally, I used USB ports on my computer and a HUB connected to my computer. All options charged the batteries without issue.The Huahui AAA comes with capsules that convert them to AA. Unfortunately, there are 4 batteries but only two capsules. From what I tested; they definitely work. But I admit the capsules do feel a little cheap, and they are slightly longer than a true AA battery. I measured an AA Duracell at 1.96” (inches) and the Huahui AAA in the AA capsule at 1.98”. Not a huge difference at .02”, but if the device you are putting them into is picky, it may cause some problems. Additionally, the Huahui AAA battery itself is slightly larger (1.74”) than a AAA Duracell (1.72”). Again, that’s only a .02” discrepancy, but something to keep in mind.The Huahui AA on the other hand is the exact same length as the AA Duracell. Both measured in at exactly 1.96”. So, they should work in any device that takes AAs.The diameter of both batteries is spot on. I was even able to slide the Huahui AA into the very tight compartment on my Apple Magic Trackpad.I also tested these batteries (both AA and AAA in capsule) on my Wireless Xbox and Wii U controllers. Worked great. And both batteries were detected as having a full charge.While many devices today have built-in lithium-ion batteries, there are still many things that require traditional batteries.

1865,B0824WB5ST,AA,2020-06-28,Not Verified,Overall a great battery and great idea!," Rechargeable batteries always seem like such a great idea. But you have to use a charger and they end up being more hassle than you realize.The Huahui USB Rechargeable AA Batteries Lithium Ion ECO-Friendly&Recyclable Double A High Capacity 1500mWh/1.5V Quick Charging for Camera/Fan/Mouse/Toy/Remote Control/Flashlight/Shaver(4 Pack) gets rid of the charger and makes it very easy to recharge the battery.All you do is VIGOROUSLY remove the positive terminal to reveal a MALE USB prong and plug it into a computer, or other charging device, and when it is charged, you have a battery ready to go again.This four pack comes in a convenient plastic case. The concept is simple and so far I don't see a big problem with battery life. I was a little worried that the space needed for the USB prong would take away space for the battery - and it does. But I don't know that it affects battery life enough to matter.To be fair, I am using them in a low current situation. I think these are awesome for remote controls. When they run down, you just charge them overnight and you are ready to go! FOR REMOTE CONTROLS, it doesn't get any better than this.The only real negative I see is making sure you don't lose the cap/positive terminal when charging. They could have possibly included some sort of wire or string/cable that kept it attached but it is a SMALL ISSUE.Overall, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND these to someone looking to replace a remote control battery. For a high current draw situation, like a toy, or something else - I would look elsewhere as you do have less battery to work with.

Thanks!",Tom Steele,5.0,6,2020,2020-06,"Overall a great battery and great idea! Rechargeable batteries always seem like such a great idea. But you have to use a charger and they end up being more hassle than you realize.The Huahui USB Rechargeable AA Batteries Lithium Ion ECO-Friendly&Recyclable Double A High Capacity 1500mWh/1.5V Quick Charging for Camera/Fan/Mouse/Toy/Remote Control/Flashlight/Shaver(4 Pack) gets rid of the charger and makes it very easy to recharge the battery.All you do is VIGOROUSLY remove the positive terminal to reveal a MALE USB prong and plug it into a computer, or other charging device, and when it is charged, you have a battery ready to go again.This four pack comes in a convenient plastic case. The concept is simple and so far I don't see a big problem with battery life. I was a little worried that the space needed for the USB prong would take away space for the battery - and it does. But I don't know that it affects battery life enough to matter.To be fair, I am using them in a low current situation. I think these are awesome for remote controls. When they run down, you just charge them overnight and you are ready to go! FOR REMOTE CONTROLS, it doesn't get any better than this.The only real negative I see is making sure you don't lose the cap/positive terminal when charging. They could have possibly included some sort of wire or string/cable that kept it attached but it is a SMALL ISSUE.Overall, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND these to someone looking to replace a remote control battery. For a high current draw situation, like a toy, or something else - I would look elsewhere as you do have less battery to work with.

Most devices learned to deal with the difference, but some simply work better with the full voltage even if the difference is only 0.3V.The tip lights up green and blinks when charging, while turning steady once full. The included AAA-to-AA adapter may be useful for emergencies, but I don’t use them as the reduced capacity of these batteries (600 mAh) is really small compared to a standard AA with 2400 mAh.The USB charging is a great idea and thanks to the space constraints in a AAA battery, the USB-A connector  doesn't fit. I like that only because the USB-A version in the AA batteries sounds like a great idea, but even charger blocks with four USB outlets don't work well as the size of the battery is typically smaller than the diameter of the AA battery, allowing only every other slot to be used. With the microUSB forcing a harness of sorts, it's great to find a single harness included that fans out from a single USB-A to four microUSB plugs.Even if microUSB is probably the worst USB design of them all (sometimes very difficult to plug in right), it's still the dominant form factor even for new devices, despite USB-C being around for a while now. So if you lose the harness, you can probably easily find four USB-A to microUSB ""laying around"".Once plugged in, charging of all four batteries at the same time take as mere 0.5A at 5.2V. It doesn't take long for all four to be charged, either. That seems a bit odd, but turns out to be a byproduct of the low capacity of only 600 mAh per  battery. A standard alkaline AAA battery is typically rated at 1000 mAh (or nearly double). So you pay the price for convenience in longevity of the charge.So these are not the longest lasting batteries, but the voltage and over 1000 charges may make up for it for low power applications.

1918,B07HQ7QV7W,AA,2020-08-14,Verified Purchase,What the heck do I do with all my old NiMH batteries now?!?," These batteries are absolutely brilliant.  They look like AA batteries, but inside each one is a 3.7V 750mAH lithium ion cell and a voltage regulator.  The voltage regulator takes the 3.7V output from the li-ion battery and steps it down to 1.5V and *keeps* it there until the internal cell drops below operating voltage spec (usually around 3.3V).  At which point, the voltage regulator drops the voltage from 1.5V to 1.1V, enough for most devices to trip the ""low battery"" indicator.As for the longevity, I can honestly say that I have no idea how long the batteries last.  I bought the set of four AA batteries with the charger and I keep that in my bag with my PowerA Wireless GameCube controller for Switch.  I play Smash Ultimate about 4 hours a day for 4-5 days a week (not competitive, I just really like the game) and rotate the batteries out each day (use batteries 1 and 2 on Day 1, batteries 3 and 4 on Day 2, 1 and 2 on Day 3,you get the idea).  I charged all four batteries to full back in February and decided to see how long they would last.I haven't charged them since.For comparison, the same amount of playtime on standard alkaline batteries is around 80ish hours (batteries that came with the controller at 1.6V gave off the low battery warning after a month and reported 1.15V on my multimeter).  The last NiMH batteries I tried in these controllers were Eneloops, but those always gave me the ""low battery"" indicator on the controller.The price is a bit steep, but considering each battery has gone through about 240 hours of gaming without a hiccup, I'd say it's well worth the money.",William Oshana,5.0,8,2020,2020-08,"What the heck do I do with all my old NiMH batteries now?!?

2058,B07HQ7QV7W,AA,2020-01-11,Verified Purchase,So far so good," I purchased these for use in wireless microphone transmitters. I can get about 8 hours from 2 batteries per charge. That's plenty for any show I do.  Disadvantages is, the battery indicator on the microphones is always 3 out of 3 bars. The indicator does not indicate capacity remaining, only voltage.  I wish they made an 8 bay charger, or something more than the 4 bay and less than the 20 bay.8/11/20Follow up.I now have 2 of these chargers and 16 AA batteries. I use them for karaoke mics. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to use them every day since Covid to really test their durability/cycling tolerance.I'm using them in VocoPro 5800 mics. I can leave the mics on for a 4 hour show with no issues. I've left them on for a 7 hour show with no issues.They charge pretty quickly. I've never had to wait more than about 90 minutes for 4 batteries to charge. I have both chargers plugged into a 7 port powered USB hub. The chargers draw about 1.25 amps per charger. The hub is capable of 30 watts which is 6 amps at 5 volts, but I'm guessing that the charger is only capable of drawing the 1.25 amps, which is half of 2.4 amps, which is what a normal phone charger delivers to a phone. It's probably because it's charging at a lower voltage. Perhaps 1.5 volts x 1.25 amps which is just a little less than 2 watts (1.875 watts).One thing I've found is that if the batteries sit for any length of time (say, over 2 weeks) and you try to use them, they don't hold their charge. I used 2 week old batteries in a couple mics recently and they squealed out and died less than an hour into the event.When fully charged, though, with these mics, they last a good long time. At least 7 hours as stated above.2 minuses:1. Using with mics with battery indicators is, the battery indicators work off voltage.

The only negative to that is that you don't get a depleting battery gauge, it just goes until it dies. But I believe that's because these squeeze out every last drop of power until the safety/protection kicks in.Thankfully they charge pretty fast (depending on what USB charger you plug them into).

I tried charging in an expensive battery charger and it will either charge these for a while then just stop, or it doesn't even start charging them. I noticed rapid flickering of the blue lights on the batteries when my charger showed 99% then some stopped but others kept charging for a while. (I'm not sure if they were being charged at all because when I put them into their own charger they went for a while and stopped charging, this could be because their charger is timed and not a smart charger though, I never tested their voltage to see for sure but maybe one day I will...) The ones that stopped charging on my charger won't charge on it again.. It just doesn't ""see"" them at all anymore, they still seem to charge fine on their own charger though. But it makes me wary that the batteries may be damaged now.2. Cost. These are pretty expensive for a 4 pack of AA batteries. And I'm not sure if they'll last long enough to break even vs Alkaline or vs NiMH because some of what I've read about them isn't great on the durability front.3. No included power adapter. The back of the charger says to use a power source that is 5 volts and up to 2.4 Amps input. The manual says don't go over 5v input as it may damage the charger.

2121,B07HQ7QV7W,AA,2019-11-13,Not Verified,"Nice constant voltage, but abrupt drop-off  :)"," All too many devices need AA cells, not many take 14500s (4.2V out of the charger), and some don't like NiMH cells (constant 1.2V), so these fill the niche in providing a constant 1.5V from fresh out of the charger 'til they abruptly drop dead.  And I despise alkaleaks, as those hateful little things will leak their corrosive innards in your flashlight, remote control, wireless mouse, whatever you have them in, and ruin the device.  So trying these Tenavolts was a nice compromise between maintaining a fresh-alkaleak voltage from start to end, no drop-off.They charge easily in the included charger (straight 5V from the USB supply), lighting the cell's internal LED while charging, and going out when done.  That's it.While they may not work in high-drain devices like camera-flash units (not like that's plastered allllll over the description in multiple places), they do work fine in AA flashlights like my SP10 and E03.  In fact, my E03 has perfect mode-spacing when using an alkaleak, but all modes are brighter and clustered together when using a 14500, so the Tenavolt keeps that nice mode-spacing without the slightest danger of leaking inside the light itself.  And so it is for most AA-powered doodads that I tried.My only critique is that sudden drop-deadness when the internal cell is spent.  There's zero warning, no dimming or fading (slow or rapid) to forewarn that you have 5sec of light left, etc.  It's unnerving.  Still, I just keep a space cell handy Just In Case.  It's a small price to pay to be able to rest assured that you won't come back to a salt-block and ruined springs/contacts where an alkaleak used to be.Constant unwavering 1.5V from start to end, no chance of leaking and ruining the device it's in, vs a sudden death when the cell needs recharging.  Whether it's right for you depends on you.  I'm fine with the one and only drawback, and am using these in multiple goodies.",LightBringer,5.0,11,2019,2019-11,"Nice constant voltage, but abrupt drop-off  :) All too many devices need AA cells, not many take 14500s (4.2V out of the charger), and some don't like NiMH cells (constant 1.2V), so these fill the niche in providing a constant 1.5V from fresh out of the charger 'til they abruptly drop dead.  And I despise alkaleaks, as those hateful little things will leak their corrosive innards in your flashlight, remote control, wireless mouse, whatever you have them in, and ruin the device.  So trying these Tenavolts was a nice compromise between maintaining a fresh-alkaleak voltage from start to end, no drop-off.They charge easily in the included charger (straight 5V from the USB supply), lighting the cell's internal LED while charging, and going out when done.  That's it.While they may not work in high-drain devices like camera-flash units (not like that's plastered allllll over the description in multiple places), they do work fine in AA flashlights like my SP10 and E03.  In fact, my E03 has perfect mode-spacing when using an alkaleak, but all modes are brighter and clustered together when using a 14500, so the Tenavolt keeps that nice mode-spacing without the slightest danger of leaking inside the light itself.  And so it is for most AA-powered doodads that I tried.My only critique is that sudden drop-deadness when the internal cell is spent.

(this is because of the claimed recharge rate of 1 hr and 48 minutes and a bit below the claimed 2700 mWh.  Still a very good showing, especially for a constant 1 amp load)For those that don't want to throw away batch after batch of alkaline batteries, these serve the great fill-in purpose for those devices that don't work with NiMH or NiCd rechargeables because of the voltage disparity between alkaline and NiMH/NiCd chemistry.  As these put out a very solid 1.5 volts, if you have devices that don't quite seem to work as long as they should, or even at all, with NiMH/NiCD, then these are excellent choices.  While NiZn can also do the trick, they do go up to 1.65 volts, which may be damaging/problematic for some devices, while these should never be cause for concern, as 1.5 volts is well within the operating range (at first) for alkaline batteries.These are more costly than NiMH, so I plan on using them in devices that I used to have to make the choice between usability (high with Alkaline/low with NiMH) and cost to environment (alkaline high, NiMH low) and per usage cost (alkaline high, NiMH low).For example, my son's electric song/piano toy required that I find the best performing NiMH batteries, and even then performance would quickly degrade such that the toy would become unusable long before I would expect from high performance NiMH batteries (Eneloop pro and Amazon 2400).  Upon trying these out, the toy works perfectly, with long run life. No more swapping/charging batteries too quickly, or giving in to alkaline!Another example is a laser level I have.  When I use my best NiMH batteries (2 batteries required), the unit will detect the lower voltage as an issue, and start to flash in the pattern that indicates low battery voltage.  While it still works, it is disconcerting/unpleasant to have it continuously flash while trying to line-up any work.  With these, the laser light is rock steady, and I am no longer bothered by the flashing (or with throwing away the alkaline batteries that only last a couple of hours).If you have devices that work with NiMH/NiCd, then don't fret about these batteries.  But, if you have devices that need a little bit more oomph, then these will fit the ticket.Since they give full voltage until exhaustion, detection that works upon voltage for low battery indication will not be reliable, so do not use them if you require sufficient notice that they are about to go out.

2155,B07HQ7QV7W,AA,2019-10-17,Not Verified,"These do not work well in high current applications, but seem ideal for many uses"," I bought these because I was interested in the new technology and I have, in the past, had devices that needed 1.5 V to work properly.  The firsts things I tried one of these batteries in was an inexpensive 100 lumen  AA powered  LED flash light.  I expected the light to be brighter with a 1.5 V battery  than with the, 1.2 V, NIMh AA battery I had been using, but I didn't see any difference in brightness.  Then I read reviews that complained about the batteries getting hot and not working well as NiMh in camera flash units.  That told me that these batteries have higher internal resistance than NIMh or regular 3.6 V Lithium  batteries. I'm guessing that is caused by the protection and voltage regulation circuitry in each battery.For most AA battery uses, e.g. remotes or other low powered electronic devices, this is not going to be an issue. I note, in another review, that the reviewer is happy with their performance powering his kids toy cars which is a not a low powered application, and, because of the voltage regulation, those cars maintain constant performance till a battery shuts down to protect itself.Camera flashes or high power flash that need to suck energy out of a battery as fast as as possible to quickly recharge the flash and devices that use the battery's voltage drop to sound an alarm to let the user know the batteries need to be replaced, like smoke alarms, shouldn't use this kind of battery.The simple battery charger/holder supplies charges these batteries fast when plugged into a USB power supply and the batteries that aren't being used can be left in it plugged in or not. Lithium batteries have very good low temperature performance so these batteries are good for outdoor use even in cold weather. The fact that the battery output voltage is compatible with devices designed to use non rechargeable batteries is useful as is the fact that they either deliver 1.5 volts or disconnects from the load. Personally, when travelling, I'll be carrying then, in their case/charger, with me and using my laptop to and the supplied cable to charge them as needed.",Mark J.

I note, in another review, that the reviewer is happy with their performance powering his kids toy cars which is a not a low powered application, and, because of the voltage regulation, those cars maintain constant performance till a battery shuts down to protect itself.Camera flashes or high power flash that need to suck energy out of a battery as fast as as possible to quickly recharge the flash and devices that use the battery's voltage drop to sound an alarm to let the user know the batteries need to be replaced, like smoke alarms, shouldn't use this kind of battery.The simple battery charger/holder supplies charges these batteries fast when plugged into a USB power supply and the batteries that aren't being used can be left in it plugged in or not. Lithium batteries have very good low temperature performance so these batteries are good for outdoor use even in cold weather. The fact that the battery output voltage is compatible with devices designed to use non rechargeable batteries is useful as is the fact that they either deliver 1.5 volts or disconnects from the load. Personally, when travelling, I'll be carrying then, in their case/charger, with me and using my laptop to and the supplied cable to charge them as needed."

2161,B07HQ7QV7W,AA,2019-10-14,Not Verified,My Tenavolts experience," Overall, these are decent batteries.  Personally, I use these to supplement my Eneloops and other NIMH batteries.The plus side of these batteries, is of course, the 1.5 volt output versus the lower NIMH battery output.  The minus is the fact that these have less capacity overall when you delve into the data.However for some devices, these our a necessity as NIMH rechargeable don’t provide enough voltage for items to work correctly.  One instance is a little submarine with a simple motor my daughter has for the pool.  An Eneloop AA fails to get the motor to perform as the voltage is too low, however the Tenevolts AA powers it around the pool.These batteries also work better for my Z wave locks, as the NIMH eneloops worked, but the locking action wasn’t as crisp, and sometimes would fail.  When you factor in the fact that each lock takes 4 batteries, the NIMH had a bit lower voltage overall.However, one device that does work better with eneloops was my Halloween LED village, with about 9 small led lights.  Some eneloop AA would keep the lights up and running for days on end, Although not as bright as the tenevolts.  However the tenevolts only would last about a day at max brightness, and when they started  to get low and run out, would strobe and flicker the lights.

The charger that comes with them isn't a charger, it's just a 5V splitter.  The charger is built into the battery, which explains why the charge light is on the battery itself.  That's why they don't work in any other charger, and no other batteries work in this 'charger'.  This is similar to all the other USB-plug lithium batteries for sale, but without taking the space for a socket or plug they can fit more capacity in these batteries.  In the attached photo you can see that each battery can be charged separately, each drawing 500mA.

534,B00HZV9WTM,AA,2019-12-01,Verified Purchase,Evaluate and break in Amazon batteries not made in Japan before rushing to judgement," I am fairly new to rechargeables and the first thing that jumps out at me is the cost of any brand with a decent reputation.  To me that means spending the money up front to get ""smart"" charging and evaluation equipment.  That reduces the chances of ruining new batteries, or worse yet ruining the devices being powered.  I purchased a Nitecore and and an Opus bt-c3100.  Quickly I learned to categorize 18650 batteries into three rough groups:  total scam batteries that should never be used because they barely put out any power and cannot hold a charge.  From reviews I have seen that means 400 mah hours or so from an 18650.  The second category is the extremely common ""knock-offs"" that copy, sometimes well and many times poorly, popular top performers and sell for much less.  These from what I have seen and from my own observations can  have power output of anywhere from 30% to 80% or so of the power of the tried and true name brand.I thought long and hard before purchasing the newest Amazon AA nimh high-capacity knowing they were not made in the Panasonic eneloop factory and were fairly pricey.  But I felt  it would be a good learning experience and for now I only power led flashlights and solar walkway lights.The first thing I did was read the directions!!!!!!! and it said charge at 250 mah.  The nitecore only goes down to 300 mah so I first discharged them on the Opus at 200 mah for 12 hours 20 minutes to 1-1.1 volts and all four(sorry no statistically significant data from this guy) gave off a measured 2440 or more mah , a little better than the rating of 2400 mah.  Charging at 200 mah took 13 hours and the cells absorbed 2570 mah , well above the 2400 rating.I will leave the discharge and power analysis to the electrical engineers with the knowledge, expertise, and software.  I will give my layman's opinion that initially these four Amazon high-capacity nimh batteries are  not fakes stuffed with sand and appear more promising to deliver  good service than the knock-offs that cut critical corners to keep the price down.  I recommend to other newbies to take the time to charge all rechargeables conservatively with a smart charger.  It is probably a good idea to first discharge and recharge these batteries even though mine came fully charged.  You would not take your brand new car and redline the engine out of the showroom.  Show you Amazon batteries the same care.  Maybe Amazon should offer detailed break-in instructions with all new rechargeable batteries.

I have both AB and Panasonic batteries, and they meet and exceed their claimed capacities.  The main difference is that the Panasonic eneloop batteries are substantially more expensive.When I receive new batteries, I don’t care if they come “precharged “ or not.  Instead I put them through a couple of renew cycles.  I’v noticed that the capacity of the batteries increase after two sometimes three discharge test or renew cycles.When I bought some more AB rechargeables,  they were still grey, but the green circle at the top was wider than before.

As such, I’m taking small steps and one of the steps is using battery-operated sensor lights to illuminate my basement.  The lights I use (AMIR Motion Sensor Light https://amzn.to/2B3wjHu ) take three AAA batteries each.  The motion sensor lights come in packs of six.  That means I need 18 batteries for each light pack (as I said, this is a slow transition).Initially, I purchased one eight-pack of the Amazon Basics high-capacity rechargeables and bought copper-topped batteries for the remaining lights.  What I noticed was the copper-topped batteries wore out much quicker than the rechargeables. The rechargeables lasted two to three times longer (if not more) than the non-rechargeables.  I quickly realized I was being penny wise and pound foolish by purchasing non-rechargeable batteries, so now I only buy the rechargeable. They really are high capacity batteries.I’ve dabbled with other brands of rechargeable batteries, but have found that these not only last the longest, but seem to recharge quicker.

So I got this time  Amazon branded NiMH batteries. They are made in Japan. They are sent to you as nearly as I can tell fully changed, or very near it.

In fact, from a power output, to a longevity of the battery, I really can't tell any difference between these and the top (expensive) name brands. And they are a fraction of the cost. I haven't had them long enough to judge durability. But in the initial charges, they all work out to the same amount of time in my potent Cree powered headlamp (it sucks power like there's no tomorow lol).  My only complaint here is it's TOUGH getting them out of their plastic shrink wrap. If you don't have a tool, you better have some pretty strong fingers. However, that's not worth a star.

1069,B00HZV9WTM,AA,2019-07-04,Verified Purchase,Not great compared to regular AA batteries," I am making a comparison with these batteries compared to other rechargeables I own (18650 various brands) and Duracell's Procell (non-rechargeable) that I normally use.I am using a nitecore charger to charge my batteries. It is compatible with various types of batteries, the 18650 and AA's in particular.The device I am using these in is my bluetooth controllers for my Windows Mixed Reality headset.The only reason I bought these batteries for my two controllers (two AA each) is because the procell's I've been using only lasts two days and I thought that was terrible. Well, these are worse. And might be even worse depending on how long they last until they can't charge anymore due to the how often I got to charge them.So here are my cons:1) Longevity of the charge. It is very short, don't even last 3 hours of constant use until the batteries die. The procell's I normally use last me two days of use. Comparing it to my LG 18650 batteries (which are 3000mAh) which are used in vape products, and my cree led flashlight, which seem to last week at high usage. The 18650's are high discharge batteries, so I'm not sure if these Amazon AA's are with that comparison.2) Cost, due to longevity and other batteries I use, these are the most expensive per life of a charge. I bought the 8 pack due to I need 4 for my controllers (2 each) and then another 4 ready to go.3) Heat. Normally if you batteries get hot during, or during charging, then that is a really bad thing. The 18650 batteries have a chance to explode. So I'm not sure if these will get to that point too, but during use they are getting warm to the touch. During charging almost too hot to handle.The batteries do say ""Made in japan"" printed on the label, which was the only reason I bought them.I'll need to buy some other AA Ni-MH to compare with, but for now I am not impressed and won't be buying anymore of these from Amazon.",firejackal,2.0,7,2019,2019-07,"Not great compared to regular AA batteries I am making a comparison with these batteries compared to other rechargeables I own (18650 various brands) and Duracell's Procell (non-rechargeable) that I normally use.I am using a nitecore charger to charge my batteries.

Most of my rechargeables are Eneloop batteries, these were purchased because they are a bit less expensive and I wanted to see how they worked. Others seem to have have good success based on the reviews. These were purchased initially for some led candles my wife purchased. The main problem I found with these batteries is that the positive terminal doesn't protrude far enough and depending on the device may not actually touch the terminal. This may also be a fault with the device's design but I have not experienced this with the Eneloop batteries and holding the batteries side by side there is a barely discernable difference. It is slight and I was able to remediate it by trimming the outer wrap from the battery but I'm not sure that is a good solution.

I use a EBL–999 charger which charges all three types of batteries I’ve purchased from Amazon. I’ve used these batteries with several flashlights and various other electronic devices without any problems. I’m a musician and I also depend on the 9v’s for several effects pedals on my board when performing live music. It’s tough to explain what can happen at a live gig when your signal cuts out. Yeah, it’s obviously a disaster when something goes wrong that should never happen in this day and age, but leave it to live muaic to expose every weak link in an artist’s or band’s setup. In a word, it’s “chaos”.I am very happy to report that I’ve had zero issues with these batteries and they’ve paid for themselves a dozen times over – at a minimum.I highly recommend these AmazonBasics High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries to anyone looking to save money on batteries.My only regret is the coin I spent on batteries before I purchased these...what a grand waste of money it is to buy non–rechargeable batteries, whether you use them as often as I do or not.

1804,B00HZV9WTM,AAA,2019-01-04,Not Verified,"I've tested them, and so far, they are as advertised!"," First, read the top-rated review from NLee the Engineer, and then go look at his reviews for comparable batteries for some background.I've owned and used 4th-generation standard Eneloop batteries for several years, but it's only been in the past year that I got more serious about looking into different brands and testing for Ni-MH rechargeable batteries.  First, if you're only knowledge of rechargeable batteries is the NiCad versions from the 90's, modern rechargeables are MUCH better than that.  In fact, while they start off at a slightly lower charge than 1.5V alkalines, alkalines quickly burn off that charge and continue to do so, to the point where 1.25V Ni-MH batteries actually output more voltage after about 30 minutes of use, and often remain usable for longer.Sanyo/Panasonic's Eneloop brand was a pioneer of the Ni-MH battery in the late 2000's, and some of those early versions still perform quite well by current standards.  A typical capacity for a ""standard"" Eneloop is around 1900-2000 mAh.  But there are increasingly ""high-capacity"" Ni-MH batteries that claim even higher capacities - perhaps 2300 (EBL), 2400 (Amazon High-Capacity), 2600 (Mr. Batt), or even 2800 mAh (EBL, again).Based on testing results and circumstantial evidence collected by consumers, it appears likely that many (but not all) of the original AmazonBasics rechargeable were simply re-branded models of early-version Eneloops.  This ""high-capacity"" version, then appears to be re-brand (or at least a functional equivalent) of the Eneloop XX model, which was later named the ""Eneloop Pro"".I tested capacity with an OPUS BT-C2000 Charger/Analyzer.  You do this by charging the battery fully, then discharging it fully, while the BT-C2000 measures the amount of power discharged until it is ""empty"".  The results for the Amazon High-Capacity brand were as good (or better than advertised).  For the 8 AA batteries I tested, the capacity ranged from 2357 to 2404 mAH - a remarkably narrow window reflecting good quality control.  For the 4 AAA batteries I tested, the range was 826 to 856 mAh - impressive given that the packaging indicates only a ""minimum of 800 mAh"".I think unless you are looking at using them in digital cameras or other very high-drain devices, the high-capacity rechargeables probably are not a necessity, and investing in a good stable of standard Ni-MH batteries is a better investment.  But for a much better price than the Eneloop Pro's, these AmazonBasics High-Capacity batteries seem to be the real deal.NOTE: I will update my post over time if I notice any significant changes in their performance.  Note that I did not do any testing for ""self-discharge"" rate, another metric for rechargeables relating to how quickly they lose power ""on the shelf"".",StormJH1,5.0,1,2019,2019-01,"I've tested them, and so far, they are as advertised!
