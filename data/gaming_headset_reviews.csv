Not for sound hoarding
","

  Theyre not good. They look nice but the sound is not clear and relatively low compared to other headsets like the A6. If you're playing games that require sound hoarding this is NOT the headset to buy.

Forget about Buying These Headphones
","

  Bought HyperX Cloud Stinger at discount during Black Friday 2019 for $30. They are sold normally for $50.  I read reviews and watch Youtube, like with others I wanted a good decent headset for $50 or under.They are not worth buying full price for $50, not even $30.I didn't use the microphone until a week ago. The microphone is bad--suck bad. I had to adjust the mic volume on PS4 to high for someone to barely hear you. My old Turtle Beach headset's mic is load and clear, opposite, had to adjust PS4 microphone volume to the very low end.The volume linear slider is not precise, stupid. Stick with what works and has worked, a wheel volume control. The  volume adjustment is bad-sucks.The only good thing is the audio quality, it is clear and the range of sounds are good.This headphone is not worth $50 that is for sure, good that I didn't pay that, it's not worth paying $30 also.

  Dead on arrival. Thought they needed a charge. Nope. Light is only green when plugged in. Otherwise the power button does nothing. Waste of money. Should’ve bought something else. Now I have to wait 5 more days for a good quality one.

Beats most expensive gaming headsets.

  HyperCloud is the only gaming headset company whose headsets can rival genuine audiophile companies. Most ""gaming"" headsets have shit on-board drivers that are just flashy and expensive with crappy quality. Hypercloud is 100% worth the money and can take on even studio-quality headsets.

After having a hyperx  cloud 2 i had to return these and order another one of those.
","

  This is not a bad headset at all but i just didnt like the way the sound quality of it was. It to my ears sounded really tinny sounding. Keep in mind everybodys hearing is different and it might sound great to you but i have gotten used to the hyperx cloud 2 which i ended up reordering after getting this headset because it sounds os much better. If you only got around 50 bucks this is a good headset. If you can spare the extra fifty though definitely go for the cloud 2 its in my opinion twice the headset this is. Like i say im not downing this headset its good for what it is but i didnt really like it that much. As with every review this is my opinion, youll need to make your own decision based on your personal sound tastes.

DO NOT USE FOR CHROMEBOOK
","

  I bought these, and I got home to try them on my Chromebook. When I plugged them in for music, it was terrible. Half of the words are impossible to hear, and other times, the words are too loud and you can't hear the music. The sound quality is terrible and there is absolutely NO bass sound at all. It was really hard to use when talking to people  on games and Google Hangouts, because the mic doesn't work and everybody said they couldn't hear me. I couldn't hear the correct sounds in any games, because the bass or the words would almost always be messed up. They are $50 but the quality is about $4.99. I wouldn't recommend this to Satan, Voldemort, Hitler, or my worst enemy.

  I am only giving it 2 stars because the audio is good an it's comfortable. I purchased this to use while working from home, meetings/web calls. I had charged it for more than 24hrs after receiving it. My first, and only day using it, the headset kept powering off on it's own while I was on a call or in a zoom session. It didn't do much for noise cancellation, I could hear my kid in another room across the house. Also to note, the power button, volume knob, and microphone feel cheap.

But some people want that. if you want super loud head phones these probably arent it. but the sound is great. Microphone is good for the price and works fine.The cables are kinda trash and are the reason why I returned these. I upgraded to wireless. But not the same brand.

  I received this headset for my birthday in April. Within a month my headsets headphones stopped working I was constantly having connection issues seems like a wire is shorted. My dad ordered another one and the second one is also defective and is shorting out in the headphones. We were told we could only return one headset because the other was past it’s 30 days. How are you not going to honor the fact that your product has literally shorted out twice?! Defective item and you won’t let us return it. I need a mic for work since I work from home. I’ve had to use a cheap pair of ear buds while waiting on the new mic and for it to arrive with the same problem instantly. I’m beyond frustrated and will never buy from this brand/company ever.

  Without a doubt it is a great product if your budget is tight, the only problem I have had is that the mechanism to mute the microphone fails and my voice stops being heard, which is terrible, but with a movement it returns to normal, anyway it is a bit frustrating, I recommend buying only if it is on sale, otherwise I would recommend saving a little more and going for some either from the same brand or another, but with a higher quality.

Worked well for a few months, then started failing.
","

  Bought these upon recommendations from gaming friends, and they were impressive. For about 4 months. The mic went out, and even after trouble shooting and reinstalling the latest drivers, and testing them on another computer and laptop, I couldn't be heard more than a whisper online even with all the setting maxed. No, mute wasn't on. No, there hasn't been any physical damage to the headphones (dropped, liquids, etc.). They were used almost daily, for about 3-4 hours per day, and hung up over the monitor with the cable out of reach of any pinch point and the mic stowed upright against the headphone. They were good for the time I used them, but my advice is you should just save and invest in a more mainstream product.

10 mins idle auto shut off feature is annoying for using HyperX Cloud Stinger core wireless for work
","

  I bought this from a store. My work is call center oriented work at home. I bought this wireless headset so that I can have some mobility at home in between calls. The price is good, the features are OK. However, 2 days into using this headset for work, I started to notice it is turned off out of the blues. I first I thought I didn't charge the battery enough, even I charged it overnight. (It also took longer than Corsair to turn it back on too). Then I googled it and found out that the headset had an auto shut off ""feature"" for which users cannot disable. If there is no audio in 10 mins, it will shut off without warning. So if I don't get a call for more than 10 mins, then I saw my call coming on screen but I didn't know the headset was off!!! My solution is to click on the device testing music every few mins, but it is a true nuance! I need to look for another wireless headset.

  When using the USB, my computer (windows 10 OS) instantly recognized the headset with no configuration. The directional sound is really good for gaming and it has good audio quality for all but the most serious/dedicated music listener (it's slightly bass heavy). Also has an audiojack for use with other devices. The sound-proofing isn't particularly strong, but it will get the job done in most settings.

  Comfort on ears is good, not great, but easy to adapt to.  Overall comfort on head is better than average.  Mic is a little quiet.  Sound quality and volume is very good.  Haven't tested the duration of a charge, but that isn't a huge issue for me.  Controls are easy to use.  Would be nice if it has software to control the EQ and a boost for the mic, but I can probably find 3rd party software that will do it.  True plug and play on Windows 10, nothing to download, no delay, just plugged in the fob and 5 seconds later it worked.  It disables your system speakers, so you need to leave unplugged when not using the headphones, and plug in BEFORE you start your game. No biggie, but you need to know this. They aren't the best set I've seen, but for the money, they are more than good enough for gaming and a good value.

  Cons:*The mid range sound is just slightly too quiet, things like footsteps in competitive shooters suffer a little.*Mic quality is not fantastic. Very cheap. But functional and stays clear and loud.*Battery life isn't great. Maybe 10 hours. Recharge it every time you're not using it or you'll regret it.Pros:*Noise cancellation is solid. You won't hear any quiet or medium noises at all and loud noises are deadened well.*Comfort is the best part. I have a big head and big ears and this stays comfortable for 8+ hours at a time without sweating or pinching.*Range is great. Sound only started cutting out for me at 15+ yards away through multiple walls.Basically everything about this headset is just slightly worse than it's more expensive counterpart the hyperx cloud flight. But that headset is nearly $80 more from when I purchase these.. I'm not sure any headset beats these at this price point.

Music is flat, but voice perofrmance is OK

  The audio quality for music is extremely poor.  Everything just sounds flat and muddy.  Also, despite their size the bass is very weak--I can barely make out the low tone in Crystal Method - High Roller.  A $10 set of earbuds outperforms these in every way.I did not have a microphone for voice chat meetings at work, so I bought these hoping I could wear them all day, for meetings and listening to music.  The mic and voice quality sounds fine and work is reimbursing me, which is the only reason I am not returning them.  However, I am disappointed that I will have to swap them out for a better set a headphones for music.  If I had bought these for personal use I would be returning them.

  Work good so far, tested against my old Logitech G930 7.1 surround headset.  Noise cancellation not as good, But the ear cups are Fabric, not the pleather that the G930's had, So after hours of use your ears are not uncomfortable or sweaty, since the HyperX has fabric, your ears can breath.  Very lightweight as well, after hours of continued use your head and neck don't feel sore.  Sound could be better, the ""NGENUITY"" software is Very basic, Sound volume, Mic, and 7.1 slider.  That's it no EQ or anything.  But once you do download the software there is Definitely a difference with 7.1 off, and 7.1 enabled.  One thing I Do Not like is the battery indicator in the software, High, Medium, Low.  I let mine charge overnight once I received them, yet when I go to use on a Fresh charge, the battery is High, but after about 15sec goes to Medium, the bar a little short of a Full charge.  Longest I have used them so far is around 7 hours in a ""Dungeon Siege"" with friends, so I do not know if they will last 17 hours as they advertise.  The Mic noise cancellation is awesome compared to my old G930's, no one can hear any background noise on my end of air conditioner kicking on or T.V. noise, where the G930's they would.  Another problem, the 20"" charging cable, WAY to short to still use the headset while charging.  These are not good for anyone with a large head, they will feel tight, and too small, but perfect for me.  If anything comes up, I will post back, but so far for an under $100 wireless headset, I give them a 4. There is room for improvement, especially for the ""NGENUITY"" software.

  The noise cancellation was top notch.  My wife had to bang me over the head for me to  even know she was in the room.  It worked great for a year then the mic quit working.  The swivel feature to mute was something I really liked but in time it just wore out the contacts.  I opened it up to look at it and the solder is so minute that I don't think I can fix it.  Off to the dump.  I would have liked to have it lasted longer but we live in a throw away society.  I'm going to see if I can spend a little more for quality next time.

  So I've had this headset for a little over a month now and it's been pretty great so far!Pros-Sound quality is great-Headband has metal sliders and adjusts well to fit someone with a larger head like myself-Cord is very long and easily reaches across my room without snagging on anything-Flip microphone works great and bends around well enough to reach the perfect distance you need it to be from your mouthCons-Although it's super comfy right now, it did take about a week to break them in to get to that level-every now and then when people are talking to me in party chat on the PS4 they cut out for a brief moment (seconds only) but I hadn't noticed that on previous headsets that I owned.-slider volume adjust on the headset itself isn't a wheel so sometimes it takes a second to find the perfect spot for your volume to be where you want it to be.The cons are only minor inconveniences however and I truly am enjoying this headset more than any other ones that I've tried in the $50 and below range. Would definitely recommend if that's the amount you want to spend on one!

  Upon purchasing the headset, I was pretty excited to have it. I read reviews and watched video reviews, it really caught my attention, even the mic quality is decent to communicate with friends through discord and in-game communication. Although, the sound can be very loud, you’ll have to tweak here and there for a balanced sound. The bass is very low, so that’s an ehh, but you really don’t notice it when you’re immersed in the game. Unfortunately, I had to return the headset because of my comfort. I have, what you call... Buddha ears, the earmuffs are quite narrow, it feels good for 25-30 minutes, but more than that; it starts feeling uncomfortable. If you’re a small head person with small or narrow ears, it’ll be perfect. Quality wise, it’s pretty flimsy, so I’d recommend not to purchase this for your children. I’m giving this 5 stars, regardless that I had to return it, is because it’s good for people who are on a budget. You pay what you get right?

  After about 4 months these became unbearable to use. The crackling and cutting out has been a huge pain. And as far as I can tell the customer service for this product has been non existent.

I even turned the Bluetooth off on my Peloton to try and kill off any possible interference and the crackling continues.

  This headset arrived and I was really happy with it initially.  The headset itself is comfortable and doesn't push down on my ears causing discomfort like some other brands.  Plus, the sound quality is pretty good and from what my friends say, my voice sounds great as well on their end.  However....the reason why it is a two star review....my headset literally broke within the first month of having it.  Of course, just in time for the return window to close.  I have damaged headphones before by screwing up the auxiliary chord that attaches the mic to your controller.  So for that reason, I was very carful and mindful to not jerk the chord or yank it for fearing of breaking it.  Well, despite my efforts, the Da*n chord broke anyway, despite how carful i've been. (I know that may be hard to believe, but trust me, I was borderline paranoid about not messing up the chord).  Within three weeks, the audio would cut out and I would have to plug the chord back in for it to work.  The problem got worse and worse and now doesn't work at all.  If this stroy relates to you in anyway, do not buy these headphones, just suck it up and invest in bluetooth.  No matter how carful you are, those stupid little chords will always eventually break.  This headset is no exception.

  Ive had it for a few months now, got it at black friday due to the discount, WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN, in less than a month it got loose to the point that if my head isnt perfectly up it would just fall off, and my head is big trust me anything can hold on, also the noise quality is absolutely terrible stereo, Ive seen fake airpods with better quality audio. The microphone is just a disaster, it reflects all the audio heard into the mic and playing anything louder than 5db would be audible to anyone your takling to, even when the microphone is pulled up to get muted the audio from the headphones still ends up into the microphone input. It feels really loose and cheap and theres definitely better stuff for less. Not to forget that each time i unmute or mute the microphone by pulling it up, it clicks which ends up deafening the person im talking to on discord. Just dont buy it trust me, youre better off  with an old nokia phone speaker than this junk.

Audífonos de uso general de gran calidad a precio razonable.

  No tienen como tal cancelación de ruido, pero son cómodos para usar, cubren bien toda la oreja y se ajustan bien a la cabeza. El sonido es muy bueno, aunque no espectacular. Se puede cancelar el micrófono o tenerlo operativo girándolo para que esté frente a la boca o arriba. Tiene entrada de 3.5 mm, para conexión doble de audífonos y micrófono, pero también tiene un adaptador para 2 entradas independientes de audio y micrófono. Para su precio es lo mejor que vamos a encontrar. Se pueden usar para gaming, escuchar música o tener videollamadas que últimamente se están haciendo mucho.

  I used these on ps4 and comparing this to the previous afterglow headsets I’ve owned, the sound quality couldn’t even come close to match it. I thought this headset would still be decent without a 7.1 surround sound option but it was like a night and day difference. These would be good as a beginner’s headset, but if you’ve been gaming for some years and are looking for a good headset I wouldn’t recommend. It also made the ps4 party sound like everyone was talking through a can and drastically louder than game volume.

  The mic pickup is very good and I like that the mic stalk is flexible. I prefer the tilt-to-mute that the Cloud Stinger Core Wireless+ 7.1 has - I don't like the idea of a detachable mic because it's just something for me to lose! The sound quality is great, and wireless range is pretty decent - I can walk into the next room and back and usually don't lose signal. Windows 10 automatically set up the device upon plugging in the USB receiver and I didn't have to do anything at all to configure it. I haven't fully put it through the ringer, but battery life seems good so far. I really like that it charges over USB-C, since I've started to replace my other devices with USB-C ones as well.

Best Budget Gaming Headset Hands Down

  If you have under $200 to spend then your best bet is getting these bad boys for consoles. They cost a fraction of 200 and I can hear footsteps further than anyone with these when coupled with Dolby Atmos. Microphone is also one of the best I’ve Ever used, just one problem is that when the volume is turned to the max, sometimes some of that noise leaks into the mic and causes a slight echo. But it’s not that bad and doesn’t happen often, only during very loud moments in games. Lastly, I’d like to say that the microphone is also another flaw in a way that the continuous muting and unmuting of the mic causes it to wear it out quicker over time and leads to the mic creating static which sucks! I know because I’ve owned several of these over the past couple of years. I still give this item 5 stars though. Keep up the great work HyperX.

  I have tried a total of 8 gaming headphones in the last 6 months. These are the best headphones out of all of them. The other 7 were priced between $30 - $60. These have the best mic quality, the best audio sound (Though I wish there were a bit more bass, but it's comparable to other headset's bass), and the ""raise to mute"" function is incredible. I can't stand the mute switch on other headphone's cable controls.This headset has also lasted for over 6 months and I take it to my buddy's house, in my backpack, consistently. It is a GREAT headset and worth buying this over other ""less known"" headsets.

Not good quality; sized too big vs one size fits all

  The ear and head band pieces are quite bigger than any other we have purchased. The sound quality is very lacking in that my son’s currently broken pair of a different brand are of better sound quality and are therefore rendered useless. Very disappointing purchase.

Works at first...
","

  I really thought I liked this product.  When I first got it, it worked great and the duo said it sounded great on their end as well. However, 3 weeks in and the mic quality got really bad. So I ordered another one, thinking the first one was defective. I got the second one and within a week, the mic stopped working and was just static. I thought this product would be good because it wasn't cheap and it comes from a good company but both headsets broke very quickly after taking good care of them. I wouldn't buy again

  Haven't had this headset for a year yet and my friends are hearing echoing and buzzing sounds. I am frustrated. $70 down the drain for a headset. Absolutely crazy!! It is annoying that I can't talk to my friends because of the echo and buzzing and when we are playing a game that requires communication all the time.

Great entry gaming headset for xbox playstation or pc
","

  This is a comfortable, well built, good sounding headset for a low price. The microphone quality is acceptable for multiplayer chatting, maybe not so much for streaming or podcasting. The volume rocker on the right earcup is a very nice touch being someone who does not touch their system volume. The ""push up to mute"" microphone feature has come in handy more times than expected, when a random phone call or visitor pops up. Overall, I don't by any means recommend these for music listening, but as a gaming headset you will get a bassy, immersive sound stage with a solid microphone to boot and some nice touches, with solid (albeit plastic) build quality that seems as though it will take a solid beating. I have had mine for 4 months and they look brand new.

Fuzzy speakers during most games even at low volume
","

  I must have a fault pair, or something. I've had these headphones for 6 days, and both speakers emit a fuzzy sound when I'm doing a big action scene. When I was going up against Freide in Dark Souls 3, it sounded like the speakers were about to give out when the fire started going during the boss fight. I have the volume turned down to an appropriate setting, as my last pair of headphones did not do this.This problem arose on day 2 of use. I submitted a ticket to HyperX support 5 days ago, and still have yet to hear back. Don't get these if you play video games.The sound quality for music, however, is great.

  If money is a problem, this is one of the gaming headphones I'd recommend to anyone. There are also deals on this pair often, be on the lookout.

The bass is made of Mud!
","

  This headset looked so promising, as i have and love the HyperX cloud 2 headset.But, unfortunetly it fell short on almost all aspects.PROS:Mic is clear and loud, flip to mute is handy dandyHeadset is very lightweight and confortablePowering on and connecting to a PC is a breezeCONS:the user interface offers no EQ options, literally mic volume, headset volume (which is controlled on the headset so this is not needed) and 7.1 surround on/off.The 7.1 surround does not sound good at all. when its turned on, the volume triples, the bass turns to mud and the spacial recognition is terrible. footsteps sound like theyre in your head, while the gun youre firing in front  of your face is quiet as can be.With the surround off, the volume and quality is awesome, but the lack of surround sound makes it un usable in most FPS games.I would not recommend this for casual listening, chatting with friends, or FPS games.I would recommend this to people who play single player games and dont need the surround sound. but at that point, buy a different headset.

Good mic, good extension, good noise cancelling, good flexible fit, needs longer cord
","

  The mic is nice and flexible.The noise cancelling helps keep noise from leaking out of the headphones into the mic.The extension works correctly and can fit many sizes of heads. It doesn't clamp down and hurt your ears.The fabric that the ear covers are made of are a little irritating, but not enough for it to make too much difference.The muting on the mic works fine, however it would be nice if the length of the actual cord was longer.Would definitely purchase these in the future for forty bucks.

  5/24/20Mute feature does not function on this headset. 3.5 mm Jack is difficult to remove from port and I need to be excessively gentle to remove it.  Based on review photos of snapped Jack's, I can see why and how they snapped. Crackle comes through extremely noticable when listening to any music app on laptop (I use Spotify and Google play).I dropped my review 2 stars based on the ineffective mute functionand 3.5 mm Jack issue. Lesser quality headphones have better functionality in these departments. However, the game and movie audio (especially when plugged into my Xbox One controller) are outstanding. Also, they are very comfortable and after tonight's 4 hour D&D session my ears were only slightly sweaty but not in pain. The music sound issue is something I was prepared for.I will be contacting the seller to discuss replacement/refund and will reupdate with a review to include their response, how they handled the exchange, and- if replaced- the quality of the new set.5/20/20Articles read on Tom's guide, PCgamer, digital trends(wireless version), and the tech lounge. I searched for ""best gaming headset 2020"" and ""best budget going headset 2020""When I first plugged em into my Xbox controller and turned on Skyrim, I heard what I could only guess to be static. This was extremely off-putting especially since I literally just unboxed em. I fiddled with the volume and checked my settings. At max volume on the headset, I hear crackling. This is in line with many reviews stating that they cannot handle high volume. However, when I got the Xbox settings fixed I found the cause of the static... It was the wind rustling the trees and grass in the game.Sound quality: 4/5: at max volume the speakers crackle. The ""surround sound""/directional sound is on point. I was able to tell that the trees were moving behinde and my follower was in front of me. As I moved around my follower, their voice direction changed appropriately. Music quality is also sub par compared to my Skull Candy wired ear buds and my IJoy Bluetooth Headphones. They aren't going to be my music headphones, so that is nbd.Comfort: 5/5 so far. These are perfectly comfortable. They fit my ears completely and are not too snug on my big ol head, and the do not snag or press on my wife's industrial. The 90° turn makes wearing them around your neck a game changer. I am gonna test the comfort-over-time tonight during a Skyrim binge and Saturday during a Discord DnD session (4-5 hours).Mic: no rating yet. Haven't had a chance to use it. I have that DnD game this weekend that will be the trial run for the mic.Noise cancellation: 4/5. With the system volume turned to max and the headset volume at ~50% I could not hear my wife speaking to me from the other end of the sofa. However the game was awfully loud in my ears and I likely won't play with it that loud. At much lower levels (system at ~50% and headset at ~25%), I had little issues hearing my wife talk.I will return and update the review in 3 weeks.

  I can't speak about the other bad reviews but I found a lot of value in these headphones. I bought these back in Feb. of 2017 and these suckers finally died on me. Well, just the mic did, the sound coming out of the headphones is still perfect. So for $50 gaming headphones lasting over 3 years, I'd say that's great value. The sound was full and crisp(only stereo), the ear cups were nice and comfy. I could wear them for hours with no fatigue. I liked the simple mute option by simply moving the mic all the way up. The only issue I had with these(really not me but for my squad mates) is that the sound from the headphones kind of bleeds through and gets picked up by the mic. So my teammates could here my game audio sometimes. Other than that, I was very satisfied with these and planning to buy another pair right now.

Cloud Stinger with VERY loud static in the headset when muting
","

  I will start off by saying that when this headset is functional, I ABSOLUTELY love it!  Unfortunately, I'm on my second headset, and I'm having the same issue with this headset that I had with the first.I purchased this headset on 16.06.2018.  About a year later, the headset had a ridiculous amount of static in it when I tried to speak with it.  HyperX's customer service was nothing short of FANTASTIC, and offered to ship me a free replacement.  The replacement worked great!  Unfortunately, It is a year later, and now this headset is starting to act up as well with the same issue.  Any time I try to mute the microphone, there is a loud static noise.  I've double checked all the connections, and I can't come up with any issue outside of the headset.When this headset works, it's great.  But unfortunately, I'm about to submit a second warranty request.  I've never been so happy to have gotten the extended warranty.  I do like this headset, but It only lasts for a year.Example of the noise: https://clips.twitch.tv/HilariousCuriousParrotShazBotstix

  I bought these mostly for work purposes than for gaming, but they work really well - they're a good size so they actually fit around my ears and not on top of them so I can wear them for long periods of time without my ears hurting, and the microphone works well. The only thing I'd add is that the overall volume with these headphones seems to be slightly lower than normal headphones plugged in to the same computer; not in any serious way, but just slightly noticeable if you are watching stuff at a louder volume. If you're not really interested in flashy, light-up headphones these are a nice, well-priced product.

I am not overly gentle with my headsets and there are kids and dogs around.  So the charger cord got yanked, and the headphones got dropped and tossed.  Nothing that really did damage, but enough to say I was definitely not cautious while using them.  The pair I have now still work, but the charging port is finicky and there's definite distortion in the left ear.  I've already ordered a new pair.  For a house with kids and animals where I don't want to worry about them destroying an expensive headset, this is perfect.

Good microphone and audio quality.
","

  The headset is very good at containing the audio to the user. It's comfortable to wear. The microphone's audio quality is nice and clear. It sounds better when placed few inches away from my mouth, instead of so close to my mouth. The microphone setup is very flexible. I like the all-black look.The volume level was much lower than my other headphones, so when I was using it for a Zoom meeting, I didn't realize I was blasting the audio while screen-sharing files. I've figured out a comfortable range when screen-sharing, but it's annoying to adjust the volume during a meeting. However, for game-playing and general listening, this headset works fine since I can leave the volume at one level.

With only a couple problems, it is still very reliable and worth the money.
","

  Overall, the headset does it's job very well. It works on all platforms, and if you treat it gently, it will definitely last you a long time. I've had this headset for almost 2 years, and there are only 2 main problems that I have with it. The first problem is that the swivel on the mic became completely loose within the first month of use. It would fall all the way down to my neck, and does not stay where I position it. I have to position the headset quite awkwardly on my head so that the mic is close to my mouth, but it's easy to fix when wearing a hat. The second problem I had was the actual mic housing. Like many other people, the glue gave out and the little shell at the end of the mic keeps coming off. Fortunately, it's an easy fix with some electrical tape.The headset works great in terms of performance, but could definitely use some better assembly and a stronger build. I still use it as my primary (and only) gaming headset. So if you're wondering whether it's worth it or not, take it from a long time user: If you take good care of your equipment, then chances are that this will do you quite nicely. For a mid-range price headset, I would argue that it's completely worth it.

  Pros: really good earphone padding which blocks a lot of sound, audio quality is crisp, the retractable mic to mute is helpful for a quick mute and unmuteCons: the padding on the head is soft but hard on your head and it will mess up your hair easily, your hair may get stuck in the adjustable height parts of the headset if you have long hair (but unlikely if you don't move it on your head a lot), and if you have it on for too long, just like any headphones really, they will get sweaty and start to smell a bit. HOWEVER, I take them off and let my ears rest and or clean them with appropriate cleaning supplies and the smell is gone.I highly recommend these not only for the price, but the quality and longevity of the product!

  I got this headset May 5th. Out of the box there are little instructions on how it works. I plug everything in as the quick start guide says and my headset and the dongle don't pair at all. After trying to figure out why for an hour I gave up. There is no troubleshooting guide or even ANY guide to explain the LEDs ON THE DONGLE there are some instructions about the LED status light on the headset, but they were less than useless. The user manual listed ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE is for a different PRODUCT. The awful HyperX software would also just keep telling me that the headset is disconnected and never give me any settings.The headset's finish is a very light very cheap feeling plastic. I was honestly afraid that if I applied ANY force to it it would just snap in half.After leaving it to charge overnight in case that was my issue (again basically impossible to tell with the guides included in the box and with the user manual on the website being for the wrong product), I gave up and will be returning this. For $80 you could do much better. I couldn't tell you anything about the sound or mic quality because the thing doesn't work.

  These were great headphones that were comfortable while playing COD daily. That is until they started causing static in my friends head sets after about 14-16 months. I had 2 pairs of these being used in my house for the same period of time and both started having issues at the same time. Unplugging them would fix this to start, but it built up to being worse and worse. You can't hear the static so I guess they're not bad personally. Your friends may just not want to play with you any more.

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!
","

  I have purchased a total of 4 HyperX headsets for my sons due to the price point and being readily available.  However, all 4 headsets have had one type of issue or another.  The first two had audio issues and stopped working within weeks of purchase (could not hear or use the mic).  Luckily, I purchased the protection plan from GameStop and they replaced the items.  The next two were acquired via Amazon, and in addition to audio issues, the 3.5mm jack broke on both headsets.  Upon contacting the manufacturer (still under warranty), Kingston Technology, I was initially provided with misinformation and did not receive follow-up as I was told I would.  Upon initiating contact with the company again, I dealt with an extremely smug and arrogant representative who basically advised that they test their products so much that they know these types of issues shouldn't happen unless it is the customer's fault.  They also claimed to not have the original information I submitted nor my proof of purchase, which I had supplied to the company two days prior.  I was advised the claim would be reviewed but given the impression that it would likely be denied.  I gave this product 4 chances before writing any type of review, but after having so many issues and being treated very poorly by the manufacturer, I decided it would be prudent to let others know that it appears HyperX headsets are prone to different issues and that you are very likely to experience one sort of problem or another if you purchase one.  I would strongly recommend that you DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!

Great Sound and a Great Value
","

  Update: After just under a year my headset started to have an issue with one of the drivers in the left ear, but HyperX really stands by their products (even ones as cheap as this) and replaced it free of charge and even covered the shipping.Overall this is a great headset that can be used with basically any device that has a standard headphone jack. I would go as far as saying this is the best budget headset on the market.First off, for around $50 no gaming headset is going to sound as clear as this one. In FPS games like Call of Duty it does a great job of delivering accurate directional audio so you can pinpoint enemy footsteps.  On top of that the sound is very clean and the bass is just strong enough to really improve your gaming experience. I’ve tried other headsets in this same price range from TurtleBeach, Razer, Logitech, and Astro, and in my opinion this one performs better than all of them.While the materials are obviously going to be on the cheaper side (this is still a $50 headset after all), I find the overall quality to be very good. The fake leather ear cups make this headset very comfortable even during long gaming sessions.  They are super soft and headband has a wide range of adjustments. Lastly the microphone is surprisingly high quality.  I wouldn’t use this for dedicated  voice recordings like a YouTube video but it is great for talking in game or in calls, and people will often ask me what kind of microphone I’m using. In conclusion if you have around $50-100 to spend on a headset , the Cloud Stinger from HyperX is definitely your best option.

  Kind of a garbage gaming headset/mic but decent music headphones. The mic quality is bad, like really bad. Constant white noise, bad sound quality, etc. Issues just plague the mic, and just 5 minutes ago I pushed it into the closed position and the mic just snapped off. Not even a years worth of use out of it, and I wasn’t really that hard on it. Dropped off my desk a couple of times but usually when I’m done with it, I place it fairly gently on my desk. last one I bought the mic gave out within weeks. Absolutely joke quality. BUT, if you listen to music, these are actually really good in that area. Good bass, and sound. I bought my stinger from GameStop but want anyone who’s interested to know about this trash

Not great for music, decent for gaming
","

  I was disappointed that for a PC headset the cable was a little short, but it’s otherwise adequate for gaming. It’s relatively comfortable and very light weight.These are definitely tuned for bass and you’ll hear a little bit of a boom when explosions are going off in your favorite games. Unfortunately the bass is a bit overpowering in music and as such it doesn’t have a very good range of sound above the lower frequencies. It’s not offensive for music listening but not great either.The microphone is decent for in-game communication and conference calls. It does a good job of noise cancellation and isolation but runs a little hot. My suggestion is to move it further back from your mouth for the best experience. Luckily the mic is very adjustable and it won’t be difficult to find a good spot.Overall for the price I have no complaints. It’s decent enough for the price point but no better than that.

Decent Inexpensive Headset- Good Sound Quality
","

  This headset is decent, especially considering the inexpensive price.  It is lightweight and fits my head better and is lighter than the other one I had that was actually slightly more expensive.  The mic is also adjustable, which is a nice feature to enhance sound quality.  The sound quality itself isn't the best- but it isn't bad for an inexpensive setup- if you wan't Bose quality you are going to have to pay Bose prices.  When listening to something like a TV show or in game video, the sound is clear and good enough to hear what is going on with no difficulty.  My computer recognized it right away without having to download any drivers and it worked just fine in Discord.  It includes the adapter to put the one 3.5 mm plug that you would use on a laptop or tablet into separate lines for output and mic in that go with a desktop setup.  It comes with a 2 year warranty and is compatible with all of the major gaming platforms.  I really like how the instructions are on the inside of the box to save paper.  Overall, it is a nice inexpensive headset that will serve its purpose.

But after a week of usage, i can say i really like this headset, especially for the price. It’s light weight, no pressure on your ears. Sound quality compared to other higher end head sets at first, seems bad. But it quickly grows on you and becomes a non-issue, you won’t even notice a difference after awhile.

Great Value Headset

  This headset is likely the best you'll find for less than 40 dollars. Not the comfiest headset I've ever tried but after 3 hours of gaming it doesn't feel uncomfortable. The sound is good (not the best, but good for this price) and will help you hear other players as well. One of the features I like most is that the microphone is attached to the headset. Wire headset mics wear very easily, ruining the electrical connection and thus the mic. The microphone simply flips down when you want to chat with other players, and you can flip it back up to disable the chat. One feature I rather dislike is that there is only 1 volume control switch. Sometimes another player will be much too noisy or too quiet and If I want to change my volume I have to change the volume for the game as well. I prefer one switch for game chat and one for game sounds which gives you more control. Like I previously stated this headset is well worth the 30 or so dollars. If you want an upgrade over this, look into some of pricier Turtle Beach or Hyper X headsets.

  I’ve seen these on YouTube getting listed  as a great “entry level” headset. I have to agree with them, the sound is fantastic and the fact that this is the only headset currently made by HyperX that has a “swing to mute” function on the mic means you can game, flip your mic up and talk to people around you and flip it back down and there is no hassle. It is entry level because of the lack of full 3D sound. Other models have gotten it much better, but for this price, you seriously aren’t gonna get any better headset.

  TL;DR, if having a gaming headset with an inconsistent microphone is a deal-breaker, skip this one.I actually like this headset. The sound quality, the cushions, and material are all great and all worth the price. However, the only thing that kills it is its microphone. I played with this to Overwatch, Apex Legends, and Titanfall 2 on my Xbox One S. I kid you not, about 35-40% of every online game I played with this, the mic would work. But most of the time I couldn't communicate with my party or my teammates. I tried unplugging in some, didn't work. I tried turning off my controller, that didn't either. I even tried restarting my console and that worked only half of the time.These headphones are $50 not $15. It's not on the higher end of gaming headphones but the least you should expect from them is to work.

Dont buy for gaming
","

  I hate this headset, I bought it for gaming and it shuts off every like 20 min or so unless im playing music. doesnt matter if im talking or if people are talking to me in order for it to not auto shut off you have to be playing music WORST FEATURE EVER! On top of that after less than 2 weeks the wireless dongle stopped working had to wait a month for a new one. gave it 2 stars because im sure it would be lovely for someone who ALWAYS listens to music.

Good basic headset; not as comfortable as other I have
","

  I teach a couple classes at a local community college, and my husband teaches full time at a local university. Unfortunately, due to the shelter-in-place now in our state, we both had to teach from home. We had had one set of headphones with a microphone, but we needed another one. I saw this one offered, and I snapped it up so I could have my own. While this one isn’t nearly as comfortable as the one we own is, it does work well, the sound is good, and it is fairly comfortable. If you have a big head, it may not be as comfortable. It’s not high quality, and as long as the price isn’t too bad (there isn’t one as of this review), this is a good basic headset. Recommend.

Solid Headset for the Money
","

  I like this headset a lot.  It came with everything that you need to game on pretty much every device. It came with an adapter that splits the headphone line and the mic line for a computer, and it comes with inline controls for volume and a mic switch if your device doesn't come with that.The sound quality is really nice for the price, it's got great stereo spread and simulated surround.  I have tried other headphones that don't do nearly a good job with the spread.  I would recommend turning on the Windows Sonic for Headphones on on the xbox if you are using it with Xbox so it gives you a better surround experience.The fit is just slightly too tight, not enough to squeeze your head but if you play for an extended period time you may notice.Overall, For the price, these are awesome! 5/5

Decent and interesting to have wires on bothsides of the headphones
","

  These headphones is pretty much like most hyperx headphones I have seen minus the fact this one is wired. The interesting thing about this wire is that it comes out from both sides of the headphones rather than just one side. I found this to be a bit annoying as it get twisted and tangled. This one has a pretty decent feel to them. It works really well with my xbox one, ps4, switch and PC (be sure that you use 3.5 for sound and voice). I just use with my gaming laptop because it is light, small, short cable, and easy to carry around. It does take some getting used to with the material. I did try it with a PS4 and it works pretty when plugged into the controller. It is 3.5 plug to power and use so you do not have to worry about having to plug it taking up a USB port. In my opinion, the USB plug would be nicer as it does not seem to have issue with damaging the cable overtime. It also does not lose too much sound but you may have a sound card. The sound quality from the hyperX headphones is amazing. It gives a nice clear sound especially during gaming which you may have to tweek the settings to your liking but once I had it it was great! It is very comfortable headset and is adjustable. It isn't too tight but can remain stable on my head without issue. One of the biggest things about this product is the color for me. It has a traditional black color so work well for CoD (in my opinion) and tough material so you don't have to worry about it wearing down too quickly. Overall I think this product is a great thing to have for gaming whether its on console or PC. It is wired but there is a great amount of length that is given but you shouldn't be expecting to be pulling it across the room so be aware of that when purchasing this. The microphone is very clear and not too sensitive where it picks up everything but you may need to play around with the settings.

A little tight, sound not as full as desired
","

  Headset feels tight, admittedly on a large head.  Cups are deep enough, but the foam is not as comfortable.  Sounds is ok.  I am not an audiophile, but somehow music does not come through with a richness in the tone.  Not sure if the speakers are not doing their job, or the padding is not doing its job.  To be fair, this is advertised as a gaming headset (friends/players yelling at each other?) and not as a studio grade headphone.Had trouble getting this to work on my Dell laptop (but frankly can't see what's wrong with the connector).  Tested the headset on my tablet and on my Acer laptop, both were fine.  Maybe it's a Dell problem and not this headset.Final verdict - if you get this on sale, it will work.  If you want to immerse yourself in rich sounding music, keep looking.

  I've had these headphones for almost a year now and I'm overall pretty happy with them. The best thing about them is definitely the comfort, I can wear these for hours and forget they're on my head. The sound quality is just OK. They suck for music. Lots of cracking and distortion especially in the low end. I'd say for gaming the sound quality is definitely acceptable, you wont notice much wrong about it. The mic is also just OK. You'll have to turn it up in your computer settings for sure, as it is very quiet. The noise cancelation is fine. Nothing to brag about though. They also seem fairly durable. I've tossed them around quite a bit and they still look brand new. Overall pretty solid for what you pay. Would reccomend.

I'm gonna list the pros and cons and let me tell you there are not many cons at all. I hope this helps anyone looking for a great gaming headset.Pros:1. A great brand, HyperX has a great reputation in the gaming community2. Mic is good enough to talk to your friends in a party3. Can use for PC, XBOX, and PS44. Great awareness of your surroundings in Battle Royale and FPS games5. Noise Cancellation is okay not amazing but it's okay6. Gets a very good volume on all platformsCons:1. Design is all made of plastic but have had mine and thrown it around and nothing has broken yet2. Not Wireless3. Noise cancellation is okay but not the best4. Mic is okay but not the bestOverall, I would say if you are looking for a gaming headset of good value go ahead and grab this one and you will be very happy with it! Hope this helps!

  I purchased these headphones as an upgrade to my previous pair way back in 2017. Though I only intended to use it for my Xbox, they work just as well as casual headphones for your phone or laptop. For the price, it is a great buy, and they have held up to the less than fragile treatment over the years. The build is satisfying, not feeling overly cheap, and the feel is comfortable for hours at a time. The sound quality and sound proofing was a pleasant surprise to me as well. Of course these are still just $50 headphones, though for what they offer, I definitely suggest picking up a pair.

  I was looking for a mic that had the following:* mute toggle by raising the boom mic* no fancy lights with extra cables* short wire to connect to controllerThis headset works for all my requirements.  It's okay as far as comfort ability.  You tend not to notice it after wearing it for a while.I wish headphones would allow a way to hear outside with another switch to cancel the noise cancellation.  For example, if the mic is pushed downward, then it mutes it from the game but turns it up for the outside so you can hear your wife screaming at you instead of having to remove the headphone and yell ""WHAT?!?!""

Super comfortable! Bad Mic performance
","

  Pros:Excellent designVERY comfortable (I even fell asleep listening to music in them)Mic boom easy to mute- by lowering /raising micGreat to listen to musicCon:Not as great for first person shooter games for two reasons1. Doesn't distinguish sound direction very clearly.  Maybe these weren't designed to since they aren't a pro gaming headset. ??2. Others can clearly hear me through the mic, but the sound doesn't play back in real time through the headset, which makes it very awkward when talking when you can't hear yourself.3. Often when playing with others, I hear a 1-2 sec delay in everything I say which makes speaking coherently even more awkward. (Deal breaker in my opinion).Conclusion: keep as a backup pairWill go back to turtle beach. I can't seem to find anything that works as good as even their low end headset.

Better than SteelSeries Arctis 7
","

  I'm coming from SteelSeries Arctis 7, I had purchased THREE different Artic 7 headphones because they just kept breaking on me. I can definitely say that this is better in EVERY way, don't get fooled into buying a pair of Artic 7. The wireless dongle is a lot more convenient. It's easy to go from my gaming computer to my surface / chill laptop, this even works on my Linux Mint workstation without any configurations (just plug and play).The only place that the Artic 7 mildly wins is range. But we're talking about a couple feet after I leave my home, so if you're taking out trash with these on then yeah, it'll stop working. But because of this the only trash I'll be taking out is my Artic 7s.

  The quality is good. You know that going in with HyperX. For this particular headset the audio quality is... fine. Nothing great but it's just fine. Kind of expected better overall sound to be honest. As far as noise cancelling? Little. A pretty standard amount of noise cancellation for what you'd probably get for say a 20 dollar budget headset. I only paid 50 but I expected more. Mic sounds great. Love the rotate up to mute function.If I had to give it a overall rating out of 5 stars.... gonna be a 3. Good. better than a cheap budget headset. But for the extra that you're getting with this you may just be better off going the cheaper route or spend more than I did and get a better quality model than the Cloud Stinger.

I strongly recommend getting a different headset as I have seen other reviews with this problem.UPDATE: I returned the original pair and got a new pair. They worked great for 6 days until the audio completely cut out of both ears out of no where. DO NOT GET THESE.

  I have been using it nonstop since I got it. It came with everything you needed, instructions and cables. I think it was half charged. It looked brand new to be honest.I have been using it for gaming, watching shows and music. It's doing pretty good so far as the battery lasts for a decent amount of time before dying. I'd say around 6-7 hours of use. It does turn off when there's no activity so just hold the power button for a few seconds to reconnect. It fits well with my head, I did some push-ups with it and it didn't fall off. It did kind of fit my 7 year old niece's head, but YMMV.I've also went maybe 10-20 feet away from computer when using it, still connected without problems.The mic seems very good, it's clear enough to hear your voice. I would have to call someone on discord or skype to be sure. Might do it later within a week and edit my review.This is an early review but I give it 9 bass boosts out of 10 noise cancellations.05/17/2020 Edit: It's still working fine.

After a 3 hour session I took the earphones off and felt no discomfort! I am a true believer of hyperx's memory foam! The sound quality was amazing and my teammates stated they heard me more clearly without any echoing! I would purchase this product 1000 times if needed!

  I received the headset 2 days ago and played video games for about 5 hours that night and then the next day, which was yesterday, I played video games for about 6 hours. I got off for a few hours and came back to talk to my friends on discord, but noticed that they weren't responding to me but I could hear them. I ran discord as admin and tested the mic, but it didn't pick anything up. Rebooted my PC and reconnected the cables, still didn't work. Went through all the sound settings, disabled the device, re-enabled it, set it as the default communication device, but the mic was still not picking up any sound. After that, I uninstalled the Realtek (audio) driver and reinstalled it, rebooted my PC, and the mic STILL was not picking up any sound. This headset is defective. I will be contacting HyperX for a replacement. For now, I'm giving it a 1 star review as I've never had this issue with any ""budget"" headsets in the past.

  Do not waste your time buying this product if you are buying it to use with the Xbox One! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

  This review is for the HyperX Cloud Stinger Core - Gaming Headset. The kids' have been using this for playing Minecraft online and they both really thought it was cool that when they moved their heads around, the audio changed on the video game. My husband has been using it for online conference calls. The sound quality is good for that, but one caveat is when he talks, he cannot hear himself, but says that all his coworkers think it sounds fine. It pinches a tiny bit on my husband's head after a while but he admittedly has a bigger head.

  It's a great gaming headset, I use it almost every day, I had a pair of these for about a year and a half, but the mic broke so I decided to buy another pair because it was pretty good for being such a low price. I don't really care THAT much about the sound quality, and to be honest, it's not that bad. The mic is super easy to mute, you just push the mic up to 90 degrees when you don't want to talk, and the mic has pretty good quality. But the cord where it connects to the controller, I play on XBOX, breaks super easily and is super iffy when connected. There is static a lot of the time and I have to adjust the part of the cord that connects to the controller a lot. The mic doesn't work half the time, and to be honest, I was surprised that the quality was a lot worse than I remember. It might've just been this headset, but I would not buy again due to it working only half the time.

  Unreliable/Defective. Audio on the right ear cup stopped working consistently after a few months of careful use. Appears to be a bad connection with the cord that's attached to the headphones--if I wiggle the cord or bend the cord just right, it works again briefly, but then stops working again if I move it even slightly.It's disappointing that the build quality/reliability seems to be so poor, because the design is extremely comfortable and the sound is very good for the price. If they were able to address the quality issues in the manufacturing, I would definitely buy another pair, but until then I'd rather spend more on something I won't have to replace in a few months.

Amazing for Gaming and calling with friends!
","

  I didn't dislike anything. I see people saying how the sound quality is garbage but it's not! Maybe some orders get damaged on the sound quality, but mine didn't and I can play music, while on a call and playing a game with my friends and hear everything clearly. Speaking of clearly, the mic is amazing. I love the feature of moving the mic up to mute so I don't have to go to discord or Skype to mute myself and I can just switch it up and bam, it's done! Some people don't like the clicking feature when you go to mute yourself, but I do because it lets you know that you're now mute and unless your friend has the same headset as you, they won't know what the clicking noise is and that you muted yourself. Back to the mic being amazing, every time I talked to my friends they heard me very clearly and I didn't even mess with the sound on the headset at all, I just opened the box, plugged it in and got on a call with my friends. Now if you're a little insecure like me and worry about someone hearing you swallow or breathe or something, don't fear that with this headset. It picks up you talking great, but it won't pick up anything else. Some complaints from others were also about how long the cords are, but having a long cord is better than one that might be too short for some people. The headset is tied into the box with twisty ties, so I just kept the twisty ties and circled some of the cord around itself to make it shorter and less in the way. Now the last this I'm going to talk about is comfort. This is very comfortable. Every night since I met some new friends, we've been logging onto our game together at 9 pm and trying to pull all nighters while being on a discord call. We've sadly only make it to 3-3:30 am because we all get tired but we try. And not once since we started doing that has this headset felt heavy or annoying to wear. This is better than my $50 Rofeer Microphone and this is a cheaper HEADSET! I would definitely buy this again if I happened to lose it or if my brother wanted mine.

  Use this for discord/youtube videos. Sounds great. feels great. HyperX has by far the most comfortable headphones. Great headphones in general. Mic is a little quiet, so I had to adjust it myself. But overall good. But its a little harder if you have glasses, like me.

  So I originally got this headset and it worked well for 1 year and 11 months and then the audio began failing in the left ear. Thankfully there was a 2-year manufacturers warranty and they sent me a new one, but now within a year of having this new one the same issue is beginning again in the left ear. Otherwise its been a good headset, it just feels like it's designed to fail.

  As others have mentioned this is a pretty comfortable headset for me.  Obviously this depends on your head size and ear size.  I'm pretty happy comfort wise.  Battery life is okay.  I haven't timed it but lasts several hours easily which is all I play for usually.  My only complaint would be more of a possible limitation of the wireless or could be wireless interference.  It goes pretty far but not as far as my plantronics blue tooth headset I have for work.  I can make it to my kitchen which is about 20-30 feet.  If I go upstairs I do loose the audio though.  With my plantronics blue tooth I can go anywhere in my house.  I would guestimate its about 50-60 feet to my 2nd floor.  I don't use the mic so not sure the quality of it.  I do like that it can swivel up though.  I really do like that there are no wires though.  My previous headset was not wireless and it was a pain having to take my headset off just to get a drink.  If you are a gamer and want a headset you can walk 20-30 feet away and play for 1-5 hours this is a great choice.

  It sits comfortably on my head without making me feel like I'm wearing a football helmet. The mic isn't super flexible but it's adjustable enough so it doesn't actually sound like I'm eating it (so I'm told). The volume control on the side of the right ear cup thing is nice. Only real complaint is that the cord is SUPER long. I mean, I have it wound up and bound with twist tights so it'll get a little less tangled on everything, but still... it finds a way. But I wouldn't say that's a make or break thing. I think later down the line I'll probably look into the their wireless headsets.

  I've tried many headphones in the past, two of which were over $300, and I must say that these are one of my favorites. It performs pretty well in most common metrics you'd look for in headphones; however, the most outstanding feature (which only matters to a fraction of the population) is that they're one of the few headphones that you can wear comfortably with glasses!!!As a disclaimer, I bought these while they were on sale for ~$35, so that definitely played a factor in my review. With that being said, I'd still recommend this if you're looking for a well-rounded, cost effective set of headphones. If this product drops back down to $35, it's a must-buy.

You're better off with a cheaper headset
","

  I paid for a 2 year warranty on this headset (from Asurion). It malfunctioned in late January due to dead wire in the microphone. Asurion informed to talk to Kingston first and check with their warranty (which yes the headset also falls under)The company Kingston will replace the headset if:-You pay shipping-It doesn't get lost in the mailUnfortunately over here the shipping is just as expensive as the headset itself. So I sent a reply asking for a refund. 1 week later never heard from them. So very miffed right now.Pros-There is a good mute function by flipping the microphone up.-It's got plenty of cord.-Noise cancelling speakers are pretty good at noise cancelling.Cons-It's microphone is less clear than my Hunter Spyder headset.-Because it's a flexible microphone, it can easily die from it.-Good luck with replacing it if you are at a town where shipping will cost an arm and a leg. Especially if it's Kingston's warranty policies.I'd just get 2 Bengoos. They're cheaper than this mess.

","

  I really liked this product until the plastic swivel broke from well - swiveling it. I had it for less than year and the plastic swivel cracked and eventually broke after moderate-high use. I contacted the manufacturer and got the typical ""warranty does not cover abuse, misuse, etc."" which is frustrating. Its a PLASTIC swivel that broke after normal usage. This really changes my opinion about Kingston and HyperX. Shame since I really liked their products until now. If you are okay with replacing this in a year or less go for it. Otherwise I would encourage you get something else if you want real quality in parts.

  The sound quality is excellent! However, there are two small issues to address. One of them is when lowering the volume enough, nearly to the point its muted, you only hear from one ear until it's entirely down but still works when increasing or decreasing volume. Another issue is the mic. Works well on the phone but not so much on PC. Good chance it might be my integrated sound card. I'd recommend buying if you're on a budget for a gaming headset.

  I have had $12 headsets that muffle noise better than these. These I believe are advertised as noise muffling, these do not do that. The lack of volume adjuster on the cord make these a genuine pain in the butt. Having to reach my hand up somewhere to adjust the volume (if you slightly tap it and it goes slightly down you cant hear anything, you will be at almost max) Most of the time, even when my house is quiet, everything is incredibly quiet. I cannot hear footsteps or invisibility. You cant hear anything out of this thing. Honestly, get a different headset. I dont have recommendations for this price range, but just buy one thats like $70 or whatever. The seller however gave me the correct product and it was in good condition. The seller is good, but honestly I've had better headsets for $20

  ordered these in December 2019. was super stoked to finally get a wireless headset, after years of using wired I was just super tired of the clutter. when I received them they were awesome but I would notice that the sound would randomly drop to a very low volume every now and then. it was super annoying especially for war games where listening is key. after it happened a few consecutive times. I finally determined to return and give it another chance by ordering same ones back (in hopes first set were just faulty) but the second set were even worse. they would drop in volume every 15 seconds. I'm not sure if it were a battery thing or what but I was super disappointed. I'm returning the second set and am just gonna go back to wired headset to save the headache and trouble.

  I find the headphones comfortably fit over my ears whereas others squash my ears, but fitment is different for everyone. Stereo sound is great for directional detection while gaming.

  Long story short, these are fine if you're going to use them in not a social environment. Biggest issue is that the sound bleeds through the headphones into the mic regardless of how quiet it is, which can disrupt team mates in multiplayer games. Even if the mic is set to the mute position. Tried everything from setting up noise-canceling to turning of AGC(automatic gain control). No dice.Other than that the bass doesn't pick up at the lower ends but it's fine. Got these headphones for under $40 and guess I got what I paid for.

They're fine

  You should just know this right off the bat, the whole thing to me just screams ""You should have gotten the Cloud Flight"", BUT if you don't wanna spend the extra 20-30 dollars, these are the sacrifices you make.- Mediocre battery life, advertised 17 hours at half volume, I get just over half that at 9-10 hours.- Not particularly comfortable the first few days. These took me about 3 days to ""break in"" to where they don't leave my ears sore anymore. Now, after about a week, they're fine.- Sound quality is, fine I guess.  Highs, mids, and lows are good, nothing offensively bad, but nothing to write home about.- Horrible charging cable. It's 2 feet long, stiff, and just about impossible to plug in without taking the headphones off.If you can live with these admittedly minor trade-offs, they're a solid pair. But, if you can get closer to the $100 mark, the Flights or Corsair HS70 V2's may serve you better.

  I was looking for headphones that was cheap, but still higher quality and able to pick up sounds. I'm mostly deaf and need loud headphones. This is 100% not what I was looking for. No matter what settings I do, I always had to put volume to 100% and I still could barely hear anything. And for some reason, the longer I had them on, the lower the volume seems to get in the headphones, no matter how high the volume was at. Even the volume on the headphones was cranked up. I wouldn't suggest these to people who want louder headphones. The sound quality itself was good though.

Honest Review

  So I waited to do a review on this headset to fully see how they worked. For a headset that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, they are pretty great for the price! Sound quality is great, I can hear someone try to sneak up on me in MW, great if you just want to block the world out and listen to some music, and are quite comfortable for a long period of time. However, the only downside I've noticed for myself is that they're just a tad bit too big for my head even with the adjusters all closed (but that's just my personal problem). Other than that they're great for a first set!!

Headband is Uncomfortable
","

  I bought and tried these from BestBuy. The only thing i didn't like was the headband are uncomfortable after only 15-minutes of usage. Likely because they only have the single band design with cheap squishy material.When worn with glasses they squeeze the glasses a little but not too much. They should include a design that includes glasses-wearers.I love how they don't have flashy and gimmicky LED lighting.The cable is smooth rubbery-material so long-term wear of it could be a problem unlike the braided one's on my Razer Kraken 2019.The inner cushions feel like smooth leather.Im sticking with my Razer Kraken 2019's (the green color currently have a discounted price) and recommend them over these even though they're slightly heavier or same weight despite being much more comfortable.Im looking for a gaming headset that's $100 or less for playing PUBG Mobile on iphone. If anyone has any recommendations please let me know.

1 Month In. There will be Updates.
","

  2 weeks in so far and Ill be leaving an update after 1 month and since Ive seen some issues in other reviews Ill be doing a 2, 3, and 6 month as well.-- UPDATE (1 Month): Had the headset for 1 month and the headset is working great. Ive used is almost every day for gaming, Disney+, and phone conversations. The headset has no visible wear or has parts that have broke. The sound and mic quality are as good as the day I bought it. The foam for the earcups and headband have no wear. The earcup joints at the headband ends are a little more loose, but Im not concerned. It feels like it is from normal use. Honestly, it has held up better than I thought. I'll do another review in another month.-- Short version: Headset feels great, sounds great, noise cancellation is fair as they are a passive set, and good price on sale. Not sure if they'd be worth $50 if they cant last. If they do... worth the $50. Time will tell. -- Long Version: So, the package itself is good. It is designed to protect from normal travel and present the headset when opened. There wasnt any other accessories or tid-bits in the packaging. The instruction card I didnt find very helpful, but the biggest thing to note from it is how to turn off the mic. Simply rotate the mic stem upward and the 'click' means it's muted. Also, the volume control is in a nice location to adjust volume on the fly. Wearing these is very comfortable. My last set wasnt heavy, but the ear cups rested on the rims of my ears. These encase my entire ear and feel comfortable with glasses. These are also on the lighter end, but arent the lightest Ive worn. I would say the design for supporting the weight of the set is very well done as I hardly feel them. The band is wider than most and the larger ear cups with the metal in the band help support the weight across the sides of my head. The Sound. These sound really good for a stereo environment. Sounds are clear and crisp, Ive heard no interference so far, and it's easy to tell generally where noises are in the game. The bass is also pretty good. As far as I can tell there is one driver per ear, but there are little holes at the top of each cup to allow airflow for the bass. Honestly, pretty ingenious on saving cost while still making the best possible product by design. The material in the ear cups do a good job of muffling external sounds (simple foam), but not blocking it. Being a husband and dad this is great for me. The headset helps me stay focused if I wish while still being able to hear my environment. The Quality. So far? The headset feels cheaper. Nothing about the plastic says 'good quality' to me. The joints the cups rotate on feel lose, flex when pressure is applied and this isnt by design, but just because of the plastic parts. The foam in the ear cups is cheap and so is the mesh between your ear and the driver. The cord too is a basic cord with rubber insulation (a mother-hubbard to straighten out from the packaging. I feel like after two weeks it isn't trying to stay coiled all the time), the connections both feel cheap as one too many hard pulls or yanks and bye-bye connect. The connection of the cord to the headset and controller has a pretty stiff cone for protection on both ends, but I feel on the jack end it is kind of pointless, because the stem is so long and rigid. This makes it easier to snag and damage the jack. Also, the mic physically feels and looks cheaper. The neck is somewhat rigid, yet flexible allowing you to position easily, but this is probably the best part. The mute feature I could see being a problem as there is only a rotating 'click' and the more you do this the parts that create the 'click' will wear out. The volume control too is a simple slider on the bottom of the ear cup and has no true uniformity for changing the volume. Overtime this will wear out and a large movement will create almost no change followed by a small movement blasting your eardrum. This is a common issue in volume sliders. -- Overall, as long as this holds up for +12 months I can see this being worth $50. I paid $35 on sale and this so far is definitely worth that price. The sound is great, the design creates good ease of use and is comfortable. My only reservation is the quality and how it will hold up. Time will tell. ;)

  I've used this headset with the Turtle Beach Pro Adapter since I bought them in March when I started playing apex legends.My audio and mic are always crisp and clear. I hear footsteps, doors opening/closing, and general movement before anyone else that I'm playing with.The mic itself slides up with a soft click and than its muted. Slide it down and than you can talk to your teammates.I'd really recommend this combo for anyone that doesn't want to spend a ton but still wants crisp audio. My husband and I both put in at least 3-5 hours each a day into a combination of games and these have held up great. No complaints here.Update Feb 24th:These headphones have officially died. I can't with them at all. Everything is scratchy and so low its useless. My mic only works on one specific spot.They lasted almost an entire year and i only paid $40 for them. Overall, I'm pretty happy with them honestly. My husband and I used them almost every single day for at least 2-6 hours each. They definitely don't owe me anything.For a short-term solution this headset is honestly the best option at its price. If you're looking for something more long-term, I would do more research. This might not be the headset for you.

  Ran into issues plugging this into my Windows 10 laptop. Tried with and without the splitter, with a usb dongle to plug into, plugged into the laptop mic and output ports directly. Had various issues with volume on mic WAY too low, to the point where you can't hear anything but screaming or heavy tapping directly on the microphone or very loud static from the mic but volume was fine.Finally got it working with the single 3.5mm jack into a mic/output in one port usb adapter. Volume is high enough on the mic and no static. Fortunately I had all of these options, but I spent way too much time trying to fix combinations that weren't working.Didn't work with this: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IRVQ0F8/Provided splitter didn't help, neither did this: smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Y4663GGWorked with this: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L56C28R/

little issue with discord but overall great sound

  headphones work nicely but for some reason my discord has started cutting me and the person i'm talking to out so we end up not being able to communicate and when plugged in my previous headphones to see if it was still broken,  discord was fine so idk what that's about, please reply to help if you can but other than that the sound quality is really good.

  This was recommenced to me by a friend and i wasn't expecting much but honestly they are pretty good. Overall they are comfortable and are of good quality. For gaming they are perfectly fine. Music is a little lackluster to be honest. The mic also gets the job done. The best part about this headset is the noise cancelling.

HANDS DOWN BEST PAIR OF HEADPHONES UNDER 50
","

  The sound quality is absolutely nuts, it isn't overly bassy or tinny or anything it just sounds balanced. My Sennheiser Studio quality headphones have nothing on these, and as if that isn't enough this has to be one of the best mics I have heard on a headset under 100. Lastly the comfort on these is incredible, I got them today and have not taken them off for about 3 hours with no discomfort. And while your milage may vary depending on the size of your noggin (My head is fairly small) they stay on my head really well. There's a slight clamping force on the ears but these ear cups are so soft that it just means they stay on very securely. Honestly one of the best pairs of headphones I have ever used consider I got these for 35 freaking dollars.TL;DR An amazing deal for what you getThe sound quality: 10/10The Microphone: 9/10Comfort: 10/10Cost to performance: 15/10I'm sticking with HyperX for the foreseeable future

Mic kept cutting out sound right from the start

  From the first time we used this headset, the mic would cut in and out when trying to chat with other gamers online. We tested the headset on different systems and using different wifi, but always the mix had the same problem. Might have just been a problem with the individual headset we received, but we don't plan to buy it again.

  Was not expecting much for the price, but stunned by the quality! Very easy to use & interchangeable with my PS4 & XBOX 1 (sometimes the PC too).

Would purchase again, either for myself or as a gift.

Audio Quality not as Good as Other Stereo Headphones in Price Range
","

  I own 3 different set of gaming headphones in this price range.  These headphones have some features that I like, the over ear cups swivel and my favorite feature the mic mute by just swiveling it up.However, the sound quality across the entire frequency range just isn't as good as the Corsair H60.  The bass isn't as clean and there is some distortion in the deeper frequencies.  The high trebles have the same issues.  The audio just isn't ""clean"".Its disappointing the audio isn't as good as the Corsair H60 as this headset is really comfortable, the mic works well out of the box, the cable is really long, the volume controls on the headset are in a location that makes sense, and the mic mute is a simple solution that other headsets don't seem to get right.As a direct comparison to the H60, the direct competition to this headset, the H60 has better audio quality across the spectrum but the mic on the HyperX Cloud is better.  The comfort of both is comparable, not as good as headsets in the $100 range, but comfortable enough for long gaming sessions.

  These headphones are decent for the money. The sound stage is a little distant, but I bought them for gaming with a PS4 and they sound good enough. Other audio sources show that the headphones can do pretty thick bass, though the high end doesn't seem to sparkle.The headphones are all-plastic, including a cheap-feeling plastic volume slider on the bottom of the right earcup. It all functions fine, though. Friends say my voice sounds clear, though not quite as good as a wired lapel mic I usually use. Being able to mute the headphones by flipping the mic up is really, really nice. I do wish they had a removable cord for storage and replacement in case it ever wears out.The included TRRS to separate headphone/mic TRS adapter is nice and fits very snugly.The one thing that bugs me is that the headphones have very low clamping force. I think they're made for very large heads. I thought my head was large, but I keep these on the minimum size setting and they tend to fall off if I tilt my head back. Maybe the band's too heavy or not stiff enough. If you have a small head, beware that they may not stay on your head.

  Bass is over the top and it has a bad response at normal volume levels, you have to crank up the volume for sound to have an acceptable quality. Also, the wireless version is a Class 1 USB audio device, which means it can only do 16bit audio, so no HD audio. I guess if you really like loud bass you'll want it, but if you want sound quality this headset is not for you.

  Comfort  wise ; the foam  ear cups are really nicely cushioned for a 29$ headset and the headset itself looks and feels sturdy with a good mic. THE BIGGEST  LET DOWN  : is the volume wow it’s so low I’m starting to wonder if I got a faulty pair I’ve been testing it with a few games ; Fifa 20 , battlefield, Forza . I know for 29 bucks I can’t ask for too much but seeing all the reviews and raves I thought I was gonna get decent sound at the least !

  I'll throw my opinion of changes out first. If I had the design choices, a cloth ear pad would be a better choice to help those of us with glasses as the faux leather sticks to the ear pieces and the scrunching sounds as it moves gets picked up by the mic plus it breathes better. A switch on the cord to mute the microphone would be preferred to raising the boom since this avoids the noise of bumping the mic while it's active.Both are insignificant and easily worked with because in the end it is an extremely good quality headphones and mic for the money although it's definitely more suited to games and videos than music as it colors the sound too much to provide a truly neutral sound.

  I was really disappointed in the sound and the way these fit. My ears really hurt after wearing them for any longer than an hour, and the sound quality is rather poor. For lack of better description, the sound is ""dry"" (hope that makes sense). Its quite obvious that the speakers within the headphones are very low quality.I've spent $30 on Chinese made headsets that had better comfort and sound quality than these, so to have spent $50 on a product that seemed inferior was a bit of a shock.Cool that I can swivel the mic to mute myself though. And cable length isn't ridiculously long like a lot of other headsets. Two stars for the design.

Lackluster audio and fixed cable to the head set.
","

  Purchased this for the Xbox one. Right out of the box i realized the cord is wired into the head set and the other end that plugs into the controller is straight. In my opinion the end that plugs into the controller needs to be a right angle (90°), this one here will short out soon and ill have to toss the entire headset into the trash because it's wired into the headset. The audio is lackluster,nothing to write home about.

  Headset is okay, audio is okay, not the best but gets the job done. Worked well until the mic stopped working in half year.

  This was my first foray into using a gamer headset to play Halo online.This set was listed #1 in a few articles ranking afforadble headsets.I love it. Very comfortable, good sound quality. The volume adjust knob on the earpiece itself is a nice touch. With the game volume and headset volume both turned up all the way, it is super loud. That is great for game play, but I like being able to turn it down on the headset, too. This allows me to have the immersive audio experience while still being able to hear things in the room like a baby monitor, or my wife calling my name from the other room.I also dig that the microphone shuts off automatically when you tilt it up all the way.

my favorite headset, with one simple mod
","

  I love this headset. It's my new favorite. I love the slightly larger earcups, the lightness, the rotation swivels on the earcups, and the raise-mic to mute.The stinger does allow some environment sounds in, so I can hear the clicking on my mechanical keyboard, and people in the room trying to talk to me. If you want 100% sound isolation, look at the Hyper-X Cloud-2 instead. With the CLoud-2 I literally can't hear my wife talking to me from 5 feet away, with the Stinger I can. Pick your poision.I did make one mod to it, that I do to all my headsets. I cut a piece of coat-hanger to match the boom, and bound it to the boom with black electrical tape. This allows me to bend the boom to get the mic where I want it, and have it stay there. Without this, the mic keeps springing back to a position too far from my mouth. I also added a mic fuzzy,I was previously using the Hyper-X Cloud 2.... I tried the stinger out because I wanted something that didn't pressure my ears as much during long sessions, and I found some reviews saying the stinger had bigger ear cups.

  I'm not a big fan of this headset. It's value is definitely there, for 40$ you get a decent headset for watching videos and playing games but it's microphone is awful. It picks up on alot of background noise and your voice will generally be pretty quiet as well. If you aren't going to frequently use the microphone it's alright though, you probably can't beat the headsets sound quality for it's price. If you have enough money to invest in a headset or mic there is definitely better options for you out there but if you want a cheap headset that you're probably going to replace a year later this is fine.

  For headsets in the $40-$50 price range I think there are many that out perform the HyperX Cloud Stinger, its just an overall mediocre headset. The sound quality is far below the previous budget headset I replaced (steelseries $30 headset). The mic quality is just a little better according to my friends but not noticeably so. Imo its not worth the much lower sound quality. Also, the same day shipping turned into 4 day shipping. There is no local mute or volume function on the cord of he headset which is also a minus imo. I think its more of a console headset than a PC headset as its main plug is a combination meant for controllers, it comes with a splitter to use on PC. The plastic feels cheap, and understandably so for the price, however - There are far better options on amazon at the same price point.

  When I saw these headphones while I was researching for a new pair, I was a bit skeptical. I read countless reviews online and came across a common phrase between them, mentioning that ""the majority of the cloud stinger is made from plastic"". I guess according to the individual, it could be perceived as either a good or a bad thing but I personally see it as a bad one. Although the plastic aids in the headphones being lightweight, they also risk them being more susceptible to damage. Overall, these headphones are good if you're a casual gamer looking for something cheap.

  I am writing this review about the HyperX Cloud Stinger WIRELESS version, and can say that they are super comfortable on your ears and head in general. I have been using them as my main pair of gaming headphones for the past couple of weeks and they're great! I can use them for hours and hours without pain, unlike other headphone brands I've used.They seem very durable and will hopefully last me awhile...also the battery life is good, but I use them ALOT so I am charging them up every few days (there is an LED indicator to let you know whether your battery is dying)One last thing I want to mention is the range, I live in an apartment and my gaming setup is in the far back corner, I can go to the complete opposite end of my apartment and still hear my PC's audio just fine! So if you live in a smaller place, chances are you can go anywhere in your home and still have a connection!!Overall, they are a good buy. Would Recommend!

  So, I was given this headset used, I don't know how used it was but anyway, It was given to me when mine broke by a friend. It has been about 2 years since I got it and the headset is finally starting to die. There is static when I unmute now, and my headset randomly drops voice. But 2 years is still pretty good for a headset. I have never had one last longer than this before. My razer only lasted one.This was a good headset, I loved the flip mute function and I loved how noise-canceling it was. I had to leave one side off if I was listening for the oven or the door.My only complaint is that it uses jacks instead of a USB. But tbh that is because my front jacks of my PC no longer work and plugging it in in the back is a pain.

  The quality of the actual headphones is better than ~$70-100 headphones I've bought in the past.  Thought it was great, until the port snapped after a month of use, and since the cable is wired directly to the headphones (I assume this increases sound quality but really, such a fragile and frequently damaged part should be easily replaceable) I can't just replace the cable like with most other headphones.  So now I have a nice looking $50 piece of trash unless I can replace half the wire.

POOR MICROPHONE ENCLOSURE DESIGN
","

  The sounds quality was ok, not as good as everyone made it to be in the reviews. Get an actually good pair of headphones and compare. Its good enough for the price. The thing i always had a problem with was the microphone, though. The headset worked fine up until recently, but the small plastic cover came off with normal use after only about 3 months. When it came off after being used and set on the table, the microphone popped out as shown in the picture, but still worked. There is a small plastic ridge it can be reinserted into and it would work fine, but people would have trouble hearing me sometimes. It eventually broke recently and Kingstons warranty service says they wont replace it due to it being from physical damage. I recommend if you buy this microphone to get a special box for it and not to set it on the table next to your computer like a normal person would because the plastic cover will break off (poor design) and you will be out $60. The headset only lasted a little over a year. I had a poor experience with their customer support. I will not buy another Kingston product in my lifetime.

$50 Pricetag, $20 Quality, keep looking for another pair
","

  Just received them. When I put them on I knew immediately they were going back. It’s sad when a $50 product is worse than a $30 product.Lightweight? Nope. I have a smaller head, these were tight and heavy. Not to mention- hot? The ear pillows heat up and stick to your skin. I guess they consider squeezing your head between two glorified earmuffs “nOiSe CaNcElLaTiOn”.Sound Quality? Hahaha. Yeah. You’ll be able to hear more with these headphones versus without, however, I bought these to be a step up from the cheaper pair I have now (Hunterspider’s under $30) but the sound amplification is actually BETTER ON THE CHEAPER set. So it’s not that the sound quality on these is bad, it’s just... not that good. I turned the volume way up. I even had to change my audio settings back because the Hunterspider’s were too loud. The volume control on these are also in a weird place.I do like that the wire to plug into the Xbox controller is lightweight and short. The mic is flexible and the swivel-to-mute feature is much more enjoyable than a volume control wheel dragging down a wire.If you’re looking for just a pair to get the job done I don’t recommend these at all. For the price tag you could get better quality at a cheaper price. I’m nit here to promote another brand though. I’m just here giving you an honest review because I assumed spending more meant you get more, that is not the case with these HyperX Cloud Stingers.Keep your search going.

  I ordered the ‘HyperX Cloud Stinger Wireless Gaming Headset with Long Lasting Battery Up to 17 Hours of Use, Immersive in-Game Audio, Noise Cancelling Microphone, Comfortable Memory Foam, and Designed for PC’ to use mostly for video editing and listening to music on PC. I would like to share my thoughts after quite some time using these headphones thus far, but first I would like to say that I am a big fan of HyperX and the quality products they produce.Cons:Comfort - My initial impression was how light these headphones are and expected them to be extremely comfortable, however after about an hour into wearing them I noticed that the head padding just doesn't work for me. I have a bald head and find that many headphones just don’t have either the right amount of padding, or use a “not so comfortable” material. I much prefer my wired HyperX headphones for comfort.Sound - Although the sound quality is good, I expected it to be much better. For me there just isn’t enough Bass nor Volume to these Cloud Stingers. Don’t get me wrong here. The sound is nice, clear and not muddy but I really think that my wired HyperX cloud headphones sound much better.Frame - The Steel Slider frame is nice and light however the slider is a bit loose and tends to adjust too easily which gets annoying when you find just the right fit (btw they fit big in my opinion).Pros:Swivel Earcups - I absolutely love the Swivel Earcups which make it easy to turn the earcup away from your ear so that you can listen to someone talking to you in the same room without having the headphones slide off you head. I wish my other headphones had this feature.Sound - I may have expected better sound quality however as I stated in the cons, but they do actually sound good and are very clear.Earcup Padding - I have no issues at all with the comfort of the Earcups nor padding. In fact they are very comfortable, just as my other HyperX headphones.Wireless Connection - The 2.4Ghz Wireless Connection has exceeded my expectations and works much better than Bluetooth in my opinion. I can walk into the next room without any loss in sound quality or losing connection.Battery Life - I have not fully tested how long the battery “actually” lasts but it does last a long time. I don’t charge them after every use but I will say that I have used them for hours at a time, then turned them off and came back days later to find them still capable of several more hours of use with zero issues.Volume Control - Though the Cloud Stingers don’t have the volume level that I expected, I do like that the volume control is nice in the sense that you can “fine tune” the volume level. By that I mean, as you slide the volume control it doesn’t jump up or down super fast as most do. As you rotate the volume control, it’s very gradual. The control doesn’t stop either way you rotate it. To adjust the volume you need to rotate it several times to go all the way up or down and the tension is absolutely perfect. This makes it nice so that if it slightly gets bumped by just putting the headphones on or taking them off (or rubbing against your hoodie) you’re not going to suddenly change the volume by much at all. I appreciate this feature probably most of all!Other Thoughts - The Swivel Mic does seem to work well the few times I have actually used it however I kind of wish that it was removable. The USB Dongle is nice and small however I have to admit that I have lost it a few times. I have recently however found a solution to this problem by placing the Dongle flat inside the earcup and twisting it slightly to fit snug and secure (see attached images)Overall I am a fan of HyperX products and do feel there is definitely value to the Cloud Stingers and I do plan to continue to use them for video editing. However, I think there are better “wireless” headphone options for gaming and listening to music, but you will spend considerably more for those options.

  HyperX knocked it out of the park for me! I switched to these after sending my Logitehc G933 in for the second time for quality issues. After that, I decided it was time to find a new wireless set. I had a pair of HyperX wired ones several years ago and those were one of my favorite headsets to date. These have great sound and the mic is so much clearer than my last two headsets. The only negative thing I can think of is that these were definitely made for folks with a big head. lol

  The sound quality is good, it doesn't get super loud but it's good enough I suppose. So 100 or so yards away from my house it picks up the train whistle...

Save Your Money!! Won't Last Long!!
","

  Do NOT buy these headphones!!  Save your money and go with another quality brand.  The microphone will quit working with barely any use, and the headphones will get static noise.  Kingston's (the maker of the headphones) so-called warranty is the WORST in the industry.  They require YOU to pay for return shipping on THEIR defective products, only to get another pair that won't last long.  So not only do you spend money on the purchase of the headphones, you then have to spend even more sending them back. So it's a lose lose for you.  Avoid the frustration!!

  Let me start my stating that the model I am reviewing is the HX-HSCSW2-BK/WW. Amazon, as usual, have mixed up reviews from multiple models, so some clarification is required. This is sleek and comfortable headset that I have used repeatedly with my PS4. The sound is crystal clear, and I have received no complaints about my sound quality from fellow gamers. I can wear this headset a long time without feeling like it is putting pressure on my ears. The mic can be muted by simply flipping it up. A nice feature that I think more headsets are starting to use. The battery lasts several hours on a single charge, which is more than ample for game play. Plus, one can still play while it is recharging with the USB cord. Overall, this has been a high quality headset that has quickly become my most favorite headset ever. A highly recommended purchase!

  Had these for about a year now. They sound really good and the microphone mute and volume features are really intuitive and convenient. Would recommend! The only bad experience I've had with these is that I may have bent the plug a little bit and it doesn't make perfect contact inside my xbox controller and has produced some noise in that way, but it can be fixed by plugging it back in. I think it's more of a problem with my controller, honestly.

  Comfy, loud, and clear sound. Very good for the price. I like the flip up to mute on the mic.

  Right off the bat, the one thing you're gonna notice is that it looks pretty much identical to the original wired HyperX cloud stinger, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but when picking these up I can honestly tell you right off the bat it seems to have a little more premium build and these are only $89 so really for $90 you're able to get a wireless gaming headset that these are capable of being used on the ps4 the PC and the Nintendo switch as long as it's in the doct mode also in the Box you get a micro USB cable for charging, I absolutely hate micro USB cables but this does give you 17 hours of use as far as you're right around the medium volume it also comes with the wireless USB dongle and that's the only way these can be used they are not capable of being used wired, but the USB dongle is extremely clear and I was able to get maybe 40 feet of range away that I was able to use these so the mic that's on here is non removable but to turn it on you just simply flip the mic down and to mute it you just simply flip it back upThe mic is actually really good and it is hard to find a good microphone on a wireless gaming headset so what HyperX was able to pack for $89 is pretty impressive, but still, it's not as clear as the flight.The rest of the build quality is plastic it does have a steel frame on the inside but as far as durability goes I kind of feel the same way I did about the original stinger these do feel a little bit tighter in my opinion but I still feel like I can twist and turn and throw them in a bag and not have anything to worry about. This plastic is more of a matte finish so it's not picking up fingerprints right up top you can see the HyperX logo which is kind of embossed and that has a little bit of a gloss which also goes along with the HyperX logo that is embossed on the side of the ear cups as well.Ear cups definitely falls in the line of the HyperX headsets it's one of the softest most comfortable wireless gaming headsets in fact that these come in at under $90 having that comfort usually when you're spending $90 you kind of get stiffer ear pads you're gonna get something where durability as an issue and so for a hundred dollars durability and comfort alone is a big plus now these are trimmed in black if you're interested in the Blue Console model you can find them on Amazon too but I think they work the same either way because these work for the PC the ps4 and the Nintendo switch comfort was again this is typical for HyperX there is plenty of padding here this is a really lightweight headset so they didn't have to add a lot of padding I think it would have been comfortable either wayyour left and right are marked on the inside part of the headband these do swivel flat but they do not fold inward so as far as buttons and controls with this being a wireless headset when your left-hand side you have your power button and then you have your micro USB input where on the right-hand side you simply have your volume wheel, but you can just control game audio you cannot monitor yourself it does not have the mic monitoring feature built into it which is not a huge deal to me but I know it does matter to some peopleAs far as volume level I found that these got plenty loud whether using them on the ps4 or the PC that is a huge plusbecause a lot of headsets have trouble getting loud volumes with the ps4 so the big thing here and the big thing that proved me wrong is the sound out of these because I honestly thought this would just be a wireless version of the HyperX cloud stinger and it would just sound very similar to those and not really offer anything special and this again is where I was completely wrong the sound out of these are really robust it is very in-your-face and punchy but the treble is the one thing that I think is just kind of dialed back a little bit But for $90 wireless gaming headset these are pretty much damn near perfect they are competing with the Corsair HS 70 which I really like and I think these are a great competitor and I think at $90 wireless gaming headsets have a lot to offer right now.For the soundstage and the sound imaging is done very well in here I was able to tell where things were coming from pinpoint where voices and footsteps were coming from, it is extremely clear, again still feel like the treble should have been boosted just a tad bit more because these do have plenty of bass really good mid-range so again dialog is coming through very well.Conclusion to be honest, out of all of hyper X's wireless headsets they have, I think for $39 more the HyperX cloud flight in the HyperX cloud mix is a better option, but for $89 this one is still really hard to beat, just a couple of things that I would have liked to see them tweaked and this would be the perfect $90 headset.So that was my review for the HyperX cloud stinger wireless, thank you so much taking a minute out of your busy life to read it, if you found this review helpful (or got a laugh out of it) by clicking on the “Helpful” button below.

Best gaming headset I've owned
","

  I bought this for my son a while ago, he says the following:I fell in love with this gaming headset. The second I received this item in the mailbox, I ran, opened it and tried it out immediately. I started playing some games such as Fortnite and GTA, the sound is awesome, you can hear every detail, such as if a player walks for a split second, if a player is up, under, or beside you. You could even tell which floor they were on just from that split-second movement. These headsets give you a competitive advantage over the rest of the players you're playing against. Anyway, that concludes the sound part of this review.The mic, really awesome for the price, usually with headsets like this almost the same price, their mic is bad and your teammates can barely hear anything you say. When I tried out the mic, my friends noticed it immediately because they were so good, I had to test it out myself, by plugging in the headset to my pc, I ran a quick voice test as in recording my voice and listening back to it, you could literally hear me as if I was right in front of you in real life. I also tested this mic with a couple of friends with other more expensive in the 100-150 dollar headsets, my mic, was better than theirs, I was speechless on how good the mic is.Overall it is a great headset for gaming, music, etc. Sound quality is extremely good, and so is the mic quality. BUT there is an issue, as I had bought the 2-year warranty for this item, today is the day I need it, and note we've had this headset for only a year or so. Anyway, the jack ""broke"" you can say, you had to hold it down at the perfect angle to get at least one ear working, and the mic broke down on me. I have no idea what caused this issue. So, I contacted HyperX support through their official website, saying my issue and so on, and giving my order number on amazon, they replied with something along these lines, ""HyperX warranty doesn't provide any help or support for such issues regarding the headphone jack."" s/he also tried blaming me for ruining it when I used this headset properly, never messing with (until it broke of course) and so on. Unprofessional and rude. But other than that, good product, lasted a while, but all things come to an end, and this was an early one. I would recommend buying this product without the warranty because most of the damage will be ""accidental"" as the HyperX team likes to call them.

I liked them while they lasted
","

  For the most part, I really liked this headset: it sounds good, the mic sounds good (according to the people on the other end), and it is mostly comfortable. The negatives are with keep me from getting another one. My ears got hot after wearing it for 30 minutes or so. Annoying, but acceptable. These things bleed sound like there's no tomorrow. Not a problem for me, but if you need a headset that won't bother others, you should look elsewhere.The biggest issue for me, though, is the angle that the cable sits at coming from the earpiece. It was ALWAYS hitting my shoulder and collar when I turned my head even slightly. Couple that with my awful track record of getting the cable caught on everything that doesn't move and it was a recipe for disaster. I went wireless after these and there's no going back.

Wireless - Save your money.
","

  As someone who absolutely loved the Hyper X Cloud II when it first came out, I thought these would have potential when I was searching for a headset. Boy was I wrong.They are very comfy, they don't give me a headache after wearing them for awhile, they're EXTREMELY light for a headset. When I picked up the box I was convinced there was just packing inside... Nope. It's just lightweight. I've always loved the ear cuffs from this company as they don't make me sweat nor do I feel hot. Thing is, this only came with one set. If you want to replace your's, you'll have to buy them. No thanks.Not like this really matters but the packaging was cheap. I liked the idea for the plastic snapping around the headset and not having to deal with a whole bunch of extra garbage like the HXC2 but... yeah.The audio is decent. I've adjusted my audio using the Razer Synapse software so everything sound better. They'd probably be average at best, in regards to sound, without it. The mic quality is pretty good, definitely a few steps up from the HXC2. I HATE that the mic is a swivel to mute. It's the dumbest thing ever. I imagine the mic will break and stop working within a year. The person you're talking to can hear you touch the mic handle and move it. They can hear the click when it mutes and unmutes. not horrible but not ideal either.Durability? Eh, I doubt it. As I said it's very light weight. It's basically all plastic and I'm sure one drop on the ground and this thing is gone.The volume and power buttons are in decent spots. Nothing special about them. They work just fine.I love that you can use these when they are charging. It's a good thing you can because their ""17 hour battery life"" is complete horse poo. I fully charged these bad boys and put it to the test. I think they made it to maybe 7 hours before they beeped at me and the light on the back was blinking red. Definitely not 17 hours. This was just from me talking on Discord while gaming and writing. The charging cable is -just- long enough to reach from my tower to the headset and again, it's two feet in front of me. If you plan on wearing this while gaming make sure it's fully charged before you do. If your rig is set up to where your tower isn't that close, you won't be wearing these while they're charging.It's great that they're wireless and all, but the dongle size is ridiculous. It's about the size of those 2GB usb memory sticks. I find it to be annoying because I have it plugged into the front of my desktop tower and so it gets in the way (it's right in front of me under my desk). I'm sure I'll end up kicking it with my foot on accident and breaking it and my computer port. Let's hope I don't.I'm disappointed that these are hardly noise-cancelling, in regards to the outside noise you hear when wearing them. It does muffle external noise but... They could do a lot better. One thing I can say about the Hyper X Cloud II is that I couldn't hear much of anything externally when I had them on. I really miss it :(I'm not entirely sure why companies are trying to push this 90° angle rotation for the ear cups, but it's not cute, nor do I find it useful. If you're going to put the headset around your neck for whatever reason, why not just take it off? Have people really gotten that lazy? The only time I can see this being convenient is... Well never. It's not like these are bluetooth or anything so you'll always be using them with your computer. If you don't plan to keep them playing when you step out of the room, then take.them.off. Period. Just another useless feature that upped the design cost and pushed it off to price gouge gamers, again. Boo.TLDR; Save your money. I'm sure you'll find a better headset out there with the features that you need, but this isn't it.

  My son likes this headset- it's his 2nd gaming headset and has lasted a lot longer the first set. This set seems to work well for him, and the 'noise cancelling' element must work extremely well- he can't seem to hear me no matter how loud I holler! There are times he actually plays with the headset pulled off of one ear so he can hear what's going on around him.

  We're a gaming family, so we've gone through quite a few sets of gaming headsets, and this has to be one of my favorite models so far! It's extremely comfortable and the mic quality is pretty good, but best of all is the noise-cancelling. I didn't even realize how good it was until a few nights ago, I was playing WoW and took my headset off to talk to my husband, only to realize it was storming VERY loudly outside and I'd never had a clue. It was great! Everyone I chat with also says the sound quality through the mic is just fine — nothing spectacular, but no issues, either. I have no complaints and am honestly really impressed by the quality, especially at this price point!Oh, and...

  Worked good for 7 months, up until the moment the headphone jack was pulled from a controller and fell apart at one of the black bands. Leaving part of it inside the controller and the rest still on jack.

  These sound great, I like the materials, and they are overall lightweight compared to other headsets. I think the raising the microphone to mute feature is super neat. Unfortunately, they are not at all comfortable. The microphone side of the headset is considerably heavier than the other side, and within 5 minutes of wearing them I already start to feel pressure and weight on my left ear. I wouldn't want to use these for the length of a Youtube video, let alone hours of gaming. I already have a pounding headache and can't bear them! To be fair to this product, I did try to wear them for a couple hours to see if I could get used to it, but I did not adjust to the  weight difference, and it just left me with a bigger headache and a strained neck.

  The woofers in this headset are basically made out of cellophane. For no reason the cellphane because dislodged or perforated somehow and then the right side was buzzing/cracking horribly making these unusable.Hang on to your receipt for warranty replacements. I didn't, so now I'm shopping for new headphones. You'd hope that a pair of headphones would last at least two years, being used by an adult with no children or pets, but alas, Chinese manufacturing. I wouldn't recommend these, as even if you keep your receipt, it's still a huge hassle to RMA. I wish I would've just spent a little more money on a better quality brand.

  I purchased several sets of the HyperX Cloud Stingers at Pax East a few years ago. HyperX was selling them for half price so I just wanted to get a few backup pairs of headsets (my animals tend to tear them up). I had never used HyperX headsets before. I have owned several pair of Astro headsets and while the SOUND quality is better on Astros, everything else about these, I love better. SOOO much more comfortable for extended sessions. I've worn these to bed to listen to music, Astros make my head and ears feel like they are on fire if on for more than 45 minutes. I recommend these to everyone!

  This is a vine review of a free product in exchange for an unbiased review.  If you find this review hellful, please click the “Helpful” button and let me know!Pros:-  No annoying wire in your way.- Lag free 2.4ghz Wireless.  Most bluetooth solutions have 40-200ms of audio latency, which can ruin your gaming experience.- Super comfortable like all HyperX are.  I have some HyperX Cloud as well and these are on par for comfort.- Price for quality is good.  These are much cheaper than other highend sets in the wireless gaming categoryCons:- Unlike the Cloud series, you cannot detach this mic... For those streamers running external microphone, this is annoying.- You must charge them once in a while.  To go without wires, this is a necessary evil.  The box says up to 17 hours, so as long as you put them on the charger every few days you will be fine.  Just make sure they are fully charged before you think about playing fortnite for 12hrs on saturday.

  Comfortable because they go around your ear with also helps with noise canceling. Nice and light weight for being wireless. Not having a wire is great for gaming so it doesn’t get in the way. Easy to use volume control on the side. Charges quickly and holds a charge well. Do need a USB port for the headphone to work so it won’t work on an iPad. Highly recommend.

  I bought these in August 2018 and first noticed problems with them in February the next year. The right side speaker spontaneously went out and started working a few minutes later. The problem progressively became worse to the point that both speakers went out and wouldn't start working again. I was able to fix the problem and regain function in my headset by repeatedly throwing it against the ground. I smashed this thing pretty hard and the plastic all held up fine. Some scratches sure, but aside from that It still fits the same and it works again!1 Star exterior Durability1 Star comfortable fit-1 Star sound quality could be better at this price point-1 Star literally broke (short lifespan)-1 Star manufacturer didn't tell me about the secret fix

Does the job but not worth the price. Mic is good. Sound quality is bad.
","

  The mic is good for a budget headset, but I was disappointed with sound quality despite knowing it wasn't going to be great. If you want sound quality, a pair of $20+ earbuds will sound noticeably clearer and crisper. If you want a headset, consider a standalone mic with your current headphones or look for a different headset.These will do the job, but its price is too high for its low sound (and lazy build) quality. Comfort in my experience is a 2/5 and the noise cancellation is a little sub-par for over-the-ear headphones, but it's not awful. Also the cord cannot unplug from the headset, so you're stuck with the original cord (fairly long) attached at all times. On that note, the mic doesn't disconnect either. These may not be issues for some.I use these strictly for voice chat because of the mic, but immediately switch to my earbuds when I play solo or if I'm listening to music; both for comfort and sound quality. For reference, I got my earbuds for $25 ($15 with a sale) at least 3 years ago from Skullcandy. They shouldn't be so much better that I change headphones the minute I get off voice chat considering this headset costed me $35 more. And the mic is good but not nearly THAT good. The budget $25ish mics sound better than the headset, but I understand the appeal some may have for a headset.I highly recommend either getting a standalone mic and using your regular good headphones, or investing into a more expensive headset if you really prefer that style.

  If you're looking for an incredible but not outrageously expensive pair of gaming headphones, look no further.These rival my Bose headphones in sound quality, so that's all you need to know in that department. They are also extremely comfortable; I can wear them for hours without feeling anything at all. The noise cancellation feature is NOT headache-inducing after long periods of time, a problem I've noticed on some other headphones. The microphone has the unique mute feature when you pull it up, which is great for gaming, phone calls, etc. Charges fast, good battery, Lastly, I'm a huge fan of the wireless feature, because I hate wires on my desk when I'm trying to game.100% would recommend.

  This is a wonderful least expensive route to take if you want to obtain a wireless head set for your computer. It uses a USB port to be able use wireless connections.  The range is not entirely bad on this as well. The sound quality is mediocre, but better than just using a standard head set.

  Personally speaking, I found that within a small amount of time I was hating these.I was looking for a decent set, but i've found that honestly I got some odd feedback in the left ear in a short order.Bass is basically non-existent on these, so if you also enjoy listening to music, these make for a poor set to do it with.

Sound good and very comfortable!
","

  So far I have used these headphones with my PC and my Playstation 4, and they work very well on both systems, both for gaming and normal media consumption. The sound is quite balanced and works well for listening to music, but while gaming this pair of headphones really show their true colors. I can hear footsteps approaching and can tell where they are coming from (which is very helpful in PUBG).The wireless range is good, but does not blow me away. I've used other headsets with better range, but these have a good balance of all features: comfort, audio quality, range, and battery life.As far as comfort goes, I find the memory foam earpads to be quite comfortable, but they do get somewhat warm if you wear them for an extended amount of time. Also, noise cancellation could be better on these (hence the 4 star review), but they are fine as long as you aren't in a very loud environment.For the price, I think these are a bargain and would happily have paid out of pocket for them.

  I’m a fan of Hyper-X cans.  Ever since getting my first pair several years ago, they have remained a staple in our entire household. The key points in retaining our brand loyalty has been the mix of reliability, comfort and performance.  They also offer an excellent bang for the buck. This is my second pair received specifically for review but we have spent hundreds of dollars out of pocket on several additional pairs for our kids over the years. My son is a hardcore gamer and he won't buy any other brand.This new wireless Hyper-X headset doesn't disappoint. It's comfy, sounds great and battery life is pretty good.  The set paired effortlessly with my desktop after I plugged in the USB receiver.  The power button and volume knob are the only buttons on the cups and both are very easy and intuitive to use by feel.  The headset is comfortable to wear for long periods and I don’t experience any issues with weight or heat, even during long gaming sessions lasting several hours. I haven’t experienced any issues with connectivity like drop outs or other problems.Sound is really clear and accurate including ambient sounds.  Sound isolation is also great as I am able to easily differentiate the different reports, explosions and other sounds from my games.  When I engage in full-on fire fights, it sounds like I'm watching an IMAX movie or something similar. The adjustable boom mic quality is very good as well, at least according to the feedback I requested from other gamers I voice chat with.  It’s also the cause of the one very minor con I have with this headset.  A moderately audible click can be heard when the mic is raised and lowered. It sounds like the mechanism that activates the mute. It's not necessarily a flaw but just makes the cans feel a little cheaper in quality.  Thankfully, I'm not worried about the actual quality because as I shared above, we have owned and still own several pairs of Hyper-X headphones and have yet to experience a hardware failure.  The biggest reason for replacement is either the cup padding gets worn out after a few years of constant use or we just want a newer headset from Hyper-X.So far, these have lived up to expectations.  They aren’t a top tier offering and it shows.  There aren’t any special bells or whistles.  There’s no amplifier, although I find the volume sufficiently loud enough if you care about your hearing down the road.  However, if you want a set of cans that are plug and play ready, comfortable durable, affordable and perform very well, these are worth a look.

  The sound quality is very good and the headphones are comfortable. Mic quality is also very good.Only fault is in the quality of the headphone jack.

However I don't expect many people to do this as it is not practical for most.For $50 it is probably worth it as long as you are careful not to damage the connector. Don't drop your controller :)

  This product feels very fragile, and I'm afraid it will break. Especially the mic. Whenever I move the mic up to mute it or down to turn it on, it makes a loud clicking noise that sounds like its snapping. The sound quality is superb although I feel the noise cancellation could be improved upon. Coming from a very loud family with constant yelling going on in the background, it would be nice to not be able to hear them at all when I'm playing. The adjustable audio is controllable with a slide on the headpiece itself which is a nice touch. The mic quality is very poor in contrast to the great quality of sound. My voice is extremely muffled when I am talking to friends through the mic, and it is very upsetting.Pros:-Great sound quality-OK noise cancellation-Very comfortable to wear unlike other headsetsCons:-Feels extremely fragile-Mic audio is very poorAll in all, this headset is not the best, but for under $50, it is a pretty good deal. If you are looking for an durable headset with great mic audio, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for nice sound quality or something that is comfortable under $50 then this is the way to go.

  I was looking for a headset to replace my OLD Plantronics Audio 370 which I loved, but which had lost a channel. Looked at a lot of headsets and reviews, and actually bought a newer Plantronics which was supposedly the replacement for the 370. It was OK.  The Cloud Stinger was well reviewed, and I saw a sale on an open box model so I jumped at it. I am very happy with it. Used mainly for Gaming but also for music, it is light, comfortable and provides great sound. I like the earcup volume control and the flip up to mute microphone feature.  Hope it lasts as long as the old Plantronics!!

The Noise cancellation is a detracting feature
","

  The noise cancellation on the microphone does not work as I suppose it is intended, and caused me many issues (mainly, people said I sounded like I was in a hurricane). The problem was exacerbated by a faulty splitter, after only around a month or so of use. That said, you can't really beat the price:performance on this thing when it comes to sound quality. My suggestion: Kingston, PLEASE make the noise cancellation a feature that could be turned off via a software or something!

Amazing For The price
","

  I've had these for about a month now and I think I can safely say they were well worth the money. I did my research on them and heard that the mic wasn't very good, but it has about as good quality as my recording mic. The only issue is the noise cancellation isn't perfect, but it's more than good enough to work with; as long as I keep the volume of things reasonably low while talking to people, they don't hear an echo, and it suppresses most background noise just fine.The headphones themselves are reasonably comfortable, even over long usage, and especially for the price. I've only had one other headset before, but these are certainly more comfortable and adaptable. As for the sound quality, it's great. I was disappointed it couldn't get a bit louder, but that's probably best, both for the headphones and my ears. Beyond volume though, the quality is great. Bass is a little light but that's not necessarily a bad thing. But perhaps most importantly, they seem durable and have yet to show any signs of damage. They aren't just made of cheap plastic, which I think is what really helps them stand out from other cheap headsets. Instead of putting most of the budget into flashy lights, they put it into actually making a good, sturdy headset.In conclusion, they aren't perfect but I never expected something in this price range to be anywhere close to this good. I'd have to say I am more than satisfied with my purchase. I'm sure you can get something a bit better if you're willing to shell out a few hundred bucks, but if you're looking for something reasonably priced that's worth buying, definitely consider these.

  you buy the the Hyper-X USB Sound Card for $30. The mic on the Hyper-X Cloud Stinger barely works - always sounds muted and terrible unless you max all settings and yell into the mic - which is not great if others nearby or perfect if you're a rage player. I tried every option and checked every YouTube video (supposedly fixing the weak mic) to no avail.Since I was already in for $50 on this I bought the USB Sound Card or I would have spent the $80 on a Corsair or something else with better results.Sound is good and the USB Sound Card does offer slightly better sound options - and definitely fixed the weak mic.So pick your headsets wisely.

  It doesn’t have noise cancelling technology but it does block a lot of outside sounds.

Good headset for a small budget.
","

  I purchased this headset years ago because at the time I needed a decent headset with comfortable ear cups and good sound. I still use it and considering how long it's lasted me I decided to let you know the pros and cons.Pros:- Good sound- Comfortable- Muting mechanism- Very durable (try slamming it on the ground hard and it still won't break)- Good noise cancellationCons:- Microphone staticFinal Thoughts: If you need a good gaming headset but have a tight budget, this would be a good buy. The mic static happens when you have your mic volume up very high. However, when recording, your mic volume would be too low. Also if something is too loud like a video or song, the mic will pick it up. This is because of the static from the mic. The only way to counter it is to get a very good sound card and connect it through the back of your pc instead of the front panel. Aside from that, noise cancellation is decent because breathing heavily doesn't pick up on the mic but having a clicky keyboard will pick up 100%. How the headset mutes itself is by simply moving the mic upwards until you hear a click. I really dislike the fact that the mic would be able to pick up sound from a video or game if it was too loud but there is a way to counteract it.Better Headset Specs:7.1 Surround Sound > StereoUSB > 3.5mm Dual JackGetting a headset with 7.1 surround sound will sound way better and connecting the headset with a usb instead of 3.5mm dual jack will eliminate all mic static. Saves you the trouble of getting a good sound card. However, these specs make a headset cost more.Overall Score: 3.8/5

Lightweight, Quality Discord Headset
","

  They work well for the price range. The audible clicking when you put the mic up is kind of a emberasment. However I have heard no clomplaints in Discord team chats, there are things like loud mechanical keyboards that would annoy someone before these headphones do. The weight of these are the best and are comfortable for long sessions. I don't find myself taking them off, just only one ear cup when someone has to talk to me. Volume adjustment on the side is nice, but most of the time the slider is on the lower end. If I really need to adjust volume in a pinch, I do it on my keyboard. I did have a problem with mic placement, so be sure to place it close enough to the mouth. It is also nice to see the splitter cable is extra long. I connect the mic and sound jack in the back of the PC for best mic quality. It's nice to have a quick connect instead of going behind the PC every time I want to remove them. I find that phones with audio jacks, just plugging in the headset is good quality for Discord chat too. If you flip the mic up, the audio goes through the phone speakers so watch out. Sound quality could be better in terms of listening to music, but they are great for gaming. I'm sold 4.5/5 stars.

  I had purchased this product as my friend was pressuring me into buying a headset so we could communicate properly and I could have better audio than the earpiece that comes with a new PS4.  He recommended this one, so I purchased it and was pleased with the quality.  The plastic felt durable, the mic worked wonderfully, and the audio has been great.  Unfortunately, in the middle of conversation, I needed to mute for a moment.  I unmuted and said a few things during a lull in the conversation before my friend said I was still muted if I wasn’t already aware of that.  I definitely wasn’t muted.  I suppose something internal broke as no matter what I have done (unplugging and plugging the headset back in, muting and unmuting again, and even restarting my systems) has worked.  This product is wonderful but unfortunately the quality doesn’t last long.  I would recommend anyone spend an extra $10 or $15 on a better headset.

  Playing video games such as NHL 19 Far Cry 5, and Overwatch, this headset is amazing. Whether you are playing with friends or playing by yourself, these headphones are great. I got this pair as a Christmas gift. They are snug around your ears and you can turn the volume up or lower them on the side. I use these on my Xbox One S. They just plug right into the controller and you are ready to go. The mic allows you to mute yourself if you would like by pulling the mic up to your ear. The heads phones sound quality is fantastic! you can hear footsteps of a nearby player. Whether it be AI or another gamer. The bass on them is decent, but for gaming on my end, isn't my top priority. The comfort and the noise quality is what I look into for having a nice gaming headset. The noise cancellation is not the greatest either. You can hear noise on the outside, but turn the volume up and you will be fine. Overall this headset gets 5 stars for me. I have used Turtle Beaches and they compare pretty well with each other in my opinion. I don't want to spend too much on headsets and this headset is priced perfectly for the quality and comfort you want in a headset. I am a casual gamer.

  I ordered this headset a couple days before they were released because a friend had recommended the normal wired version, and I figured that because I wanted a wireless set I'd give these a shot. So far they are excellent. They are plug n play, you just plug in the USB receiver and hit the power button and you're good to go. No drivers or any other setup.I had a few requirements for a new headset which these met: leather ear cups (I strongly prefer these to any kind of felt or mesh which I find itchy and irritating to my skin), plain look - I don't like anything too flashy looking, and a smaller/adjustable size because I have a small head and I find most headsets/headphones are too big and uncomfortable. I don't think these would be bad for a bigger head either, I just appreciate that the smallest adjustment setting is actually small and fits me well. They can be adjusted pretty far for a bigger head size (the friend who recommended the wired version has a pretty big head and they are basically identical to the wireless ones). I should also mention that my requirement of leather ear cups was pretty limiting because I could only find a few sets that weren't mesh or felt. These seemed like the nicest ones of the bunch.The build quality is nice too. Leather ear cups and a nice padding on the top of the set so it's quite comfortable on the top of your head. The plastic is also very rugged and thick feeling and I don't see that giving out any time soon. The adjustable band under the plastic is thick metal as well. The connector to the microphone is a nice bendy metal and seems solid. If you put the microphone up there's a little click and it mutes. I like that. There's also a volume slider on the right side which is easy to adjust but isn't too sensitive. Overall built very nicely and strongly. No gripes here.The sound quality is decent too. Not the best I've heard, but nice nonetheless. I adjusted the settings in an EQ and they sound even better. Very nice for music, games, and TV/movies. The weakest point I think is the high end, it can sound a little distorted if the pitch is very high but this is infrequent and therefore doesn't lose any points for me. The mic quality is also nice, I was told I sound louder and more clear than I did before. No complaints there.Overall these have been perfect for me and I have very very little bad to say about these. They are very nice and worth the $100 price tag to me. I have only had them a short while though so if anything happens I will update my review immediately. I would say to anyone considering these: BUY THEM! They are an awesome headset.

  Loved the product until we had the same problem that others have reported with the mic falling off due to bad manufacturing and the vendor not covering due to it being “damaged”.

I recommend the vendor recognize it has a problem and cover under warranty or the buyers look elsewhere as it isn’t worth the 6 months you get out of it.

  I recieved these headphones as a birthday present 13 months ago. Throughout that period I never once had an issue with these headphones. They were comfortable and worked perfectly. According to my friends that I play with online, my voice was crystal clear when I used these headphones and their awesome mic, which you can swivel up to mute as well as bend it closer or farther from your mouth without damaging the mic at all. I can't speak on behalf of the audio too much because I haven't used any other big name headsets like Astros or Turtlebeaches, but I never had any issue hearing anything in-game even with a Ps4 party running in the background. If you're looking for a quality headset that will meet your needs, then look no further, this is the headset you want.

Nice looking headset, but it feels a little fragile.

  Pros----- The earpads are very soft and comfortable to wear on the ears.- The headset has a nice, sleek, and unoffensive appearance.- The swiveling mute mic function is very interesting and surprisingly intuitive and more natural than pressing a button.- The headset volume slider adds another level of control for quick volume adjustment.- Doesn’t feel bulky or heavy on my head. I don’t feel fatigued from the weight of the headset.Cons----- The swivelling joints on the earpads feel a little fragile. This scares me because if these joints break off, there goes the functionality of the headset.- The microphone doesn’t feel as sensitive as other headset mics I’ve had in the past. I have to speak up a little louder to have my voice picked up. It's decent, but not the best.- When the microphone is moved between the mute and the un-mute position, it makes a very loud “click” that sounds like the headset is breaking. It makes me nervous every time I move that microphone piece.- I feel like a mute button would have been a little bit more practical and durable than having it controlled by a flimsy turning switch hooked up to the microphone.- I’ve heard better noise cancelling from other headsets personally, but it does the job.Conclusion-----It’s a good headset for the price, but you might want to find something a bit more durable if you don’t want to shop for another one for a while. Durability is the main reason why I'm hesitant on recommending this headset to other people. I haven't had it for that long but I suspect that things will start failing in a month or two. I’m not 100% confident that this product will last for a year (unlike other headsets I have purchased in the past) so if you buy it, just expect it to act as a quick replacement for a couple of months.

Average Gaming Headset with Questionable Quality
","

  The HyperX Cloud Stinger, whatever that name is supposed to mean, are an okay choice for gaming and pretty crap for just about anything else. It does have some good features, such as the swivel to mute for the mic, but it doesn't really matter when the padding starts to disintegrate in about a year, leaving black flakes inside of your ears and on your clothes. The wires in the headset also have a habit of eventually starting to rattle around and get annoying within a few months. The sound quality is also pretty poor even for this price range, so if you're big on listening to music or audio in general, you're not going to be too impressed. . My advice is to see about getting a decent pair of headphones from a more established audio brand, with a standalone microphone. This can be done at about the same price of this headset, maybe a few bucks more. You may lose some convenience, but you'll gain significantly in quality.

  As a person who games a lot, I look for plenty of quality in headsets. When I ordered this, I was ecstatic. I couldn’t wait to receive it. When it arrived on my doorstep, I immediately opened it and tried it out. At first, it was great. Amazing sound, perfect noise cancellation, good mic quality.After a while, maybe a month say, the quality of the mic started going down. I was getting more and more complaints from my friends on Discord saying that it was super loud and distorted. Now at the 2 month mark, the mic has a terrible quality. It sounds scratchy and loud everytime I test my mic. It also makes loud, high pitched squeaks every now and then. The audio is still fine, great in fact, I’m just disappointed with the mic and how long it’s quality lasted. (Only a month!)

Hard to say about this one.
","

  This unit takes lots of adjusting the settings to sound right.  I have had some headsets in the price range just sound good when you put them on.  Not this one.  I had to go into the mic settings and use the highest setting on the mic boost icon to get it to sound right to my friends.  It is comfortable to wear and seals out sounds but I don't feel the sound is loud enough when listening to music or games.  Price point was ok but I would not buy these again.  I plugged in my old 20 dollar usb heaset to make sure I was not crazy and these do not sound as loud on my system.  I am going to keep these only because they are comfortable but I will be looking to pass these off to a less picky family member come Christmas.  These is no volume or mute on the cord.  You get the mute by pushing up the boom mic and it mutes.  This is ok but if you grab it too hard a noise is heard to all your friends and they ask wth?  You really have to be careful when using this and trying to mute.  Also when you do crank up the sound to max... which is not that high the sounds bleeds though to the mike and people ask if you have a tv on.  Took awhile to figure it out but there is bleed though.  So all in all these would be good for someone that doesn't like loud speakers and likes comfort.  Otherwise take a pass and find something better.

  These are the worst headphones I've ever bought. The sound is muffled. Although the foam pads feel good, and there is a good amount of base, it sounds like the sounds are being played from a room away.The mic is even worse. I had no idea until I tested it, but there is a constant hiss in the background, creating an awful experience for the people on the other side of the chat.I have a slightly broken pair of 3 year old logitech headphones that this was supposed to replace.  Even coming apart, the logitech unit is far superior to this one.  I won't be fooled into buying another HyperX product

  It is not full noise canceling but it does a great job at canceling out enough to fully enjoy the sound quality these headphones provide. I feel that the cables are almost a bit too long especially for PC use, no ones PC should be almost 6 feet away from them needing all that cabling. They aren't too heavy and are very comfortable, I use them for very extended periods of time and it doesn't hurt my ears, head or neck.

  Initial impressions:- decent packaging- nice design- mostly made of plastic, feels cheap, feels like it will break- comfortable on ears (much more so than my razer krakens which this replaced)After a few hours of usage:- still comfortable, no ear paint, or excessive sweating around the ears- great noise cancellation- Microphone sounds decent, love the auto mute when flipped up feature- Volumne control on the headset is more practical (vs the Krakens on-line controller which eventually stopped working properly)- SOUND QUALITY BELOW AVERAGEExpanding on the last point:The sound just isnt good to me. Coming from the razer kraken, the sound quality dropped a considerable amount. A few hours of apex legends, the audio from this headset sounds hollow and thin. It just sounds cheap. But for $50 i cannot expect the same sound quality as my Sennheiser hd380 that i used for mixing and mastering. I may need to just tweak the sound and even out the mid, and boost the bass cause the sound produced by the headset sounds like both of those levels have been dropped and the treble boosted all the way up (hollow, thin, crisp).Overall 3/5 from me. The sound quality cost it 2 stars, otherwise it wouldve been a 5/5 at this price point of $50.

  I have only one gripe with this headset and it could be a deal breaker for some, not too much for me. But these headsets have a huge problem with noise bleeding from the earphones back into the microphone. You literally have to have your headset turned down a lot to avoid having that boeed through. Other than that the sound quality sounds great, they are super comfortable and feel pretty durable for what you pay for them. All in all a decent headset except for the audio bleed.

Recently, the plastic part for the filter of the microphone snapped and it no longer has a filter. The speakers also are starting to rattle and give a nasty shake sound to it.

  After 2 Logitech headsets, the G430 which I'd had since moving from PC to PS4 and the G930 which was too quiet on the ps4, and a slew of random headphones and earbud configurations I can say that while I haven't had any experience with high-end gear that I honestly can't think of too many ways in which the HyperX Stinger headset could be better. It could be made out of better materials, the ear cups could be shaped a little differently, and they could have used something other than pleather for the pads, it could have used a 2-prong 3.5mm connector rather than the single... but that's all minor and can be summed up as this headset feels like something in its price range. But that's it. The sound is fantastic, it's loud even through the DS4 (which is notorious for making headsets quiet), it isolates outside noises really well, it projects location and distance superbly, it fits my big head, the microphone is really nice, and it's priced excellently for what you get. I would highly recommend this to someone looking for a budget headset.Disclosure: I did not buy this on Amazon.

  First off, I do not consider myself a ""gamer"", so for the Gamers out there, my review may not be relevant enough for you.A group of friends talked me into playing World of Warcraft with them. So, I was looking for a basic headset with decent reviews for a relatively inexpensive price. That way if I didn't care for it, I wouldn't be out much cash.  I checked out a couple online review site by gamers specifically for inexpensive headsets.  This set came up in the top 10 on a couple sites. So for the price I figured I would give them a shot.I've had them a couple weeks now, so this is a new product review still. (if anything significant changes I'll post an update)Comfort: 8 out of 10.  (compared to regular audio headsets I've worn)They are relatively light weight and breath well (no sweaty ears)Noise Cancelling: 6 out of 10.Not the best noise cancelling if you really need it. I don't so this doesn't bother me.Audio: 8 out of 10.This is hard to rate so far. As I haven't really done a comparison test.  may have to circle back to it. For my level of game play in WoW, the sound seems good to me.Mic: N/ACan't really rate the Mic quality.. I'm not a big talker, so no one in my group has commented on Audio quality from me.So, For a beginner Headset for a relatively low price I would say it is a great buy.

I contacted Kensington to try and file a warranty claim since the headsets were less than 6 months old and found out that a broken or bent connector is not covered by the warranty.  My advice is to avoid these like the plague.  I will definitely be avoiding Kensington products from here on out.  I would have more respect for a company that just flat out says once you buy it there are no refunds or warranty than have a big written fine print warranty, that of course doesn’t cover anything.  DON’T BUY

  These are not studio quality headphones. The noise bleed, especially certain sounds, from can sometimes be picked up from the microphone. However, these are fantastic for the price point. For only $50 you get a headset that can be used on your PC or phone and delivers MUCH better sound than the speakers in a phone, TV or PC. I would also rate these a 5 for comfort. I can wear these for HOURS and my ears don't get hot or uncomfortable. I have owned this set for close to a year now and even bought a pair for my mother so she can do hands free calling in her office. I also bought a pair for a friend as a gift which were a big improvement over his (phone) earbuds.

  First let me say that this is my favorite gaming headset that I had bought yet. The sound is good, maybe not the absolute best, but good enough that I can hear directional noise cues like footsteps quite easily. The mic is great at picking up my voice and not any of the other sounds in the room. I also really like that you just slide the mic up to mute it, as I found that easier than many headsets that have mute buttons alongside the volume controls on the cord. Last but not least, these are the most comfortable gaming headphones I've ever owned. They are light enough that I could wear them for hours without any discomfort. Most headsets might feel fine after long gaming sessions until I shift my head a bit and realize my ears are aching from being pressed to my head. The over the ear design of these are roomy enough that my ears never hurt which I really appreciated.

  I used to have a refurbished Razer headset before this one. The sound quality on my old headset was excellent; I thought nothing could compete. However, this headset does a fantastic job in terms of audio quality, although it falls ever so slightly short for me. That being said, it's WORLDS more comfortable. It's pretty lightweight and not very bulky, and the fold up mic is great. I haven't heard any major complains about my mic's quality from people I've talked to. I'd definitely recommend this headset to anyone who just wants an all-around great and comfortable headset.

  *EDIT: MY RIGHT EAR STOPPED WORKING AT A YEAR'S TIME. I AM UPSET, AND HAD SOME ISSUES CONTACTING HYPERX INITIALLY, BUT FINALLY GOT A HOLD OF A HUMAN AND AM WORKING ON A REPLACEMENT. WILL UPDATE IF THEY ACTUALLY HONOR THEIR WARRANTY.*First off, build is great, sound is great, and comfort is great. But if you are plugging into a PS4 controller and are used to ear buds or a powered/amplified headset, then these DO NOT GET LOUD ENOUGH. I mean, for most games and movies they are fine, but I have to keep at max volume. And if it's a quiet movie or YouTube video, there is no way of increasing volume. And yes, volume at max on headset AND PS4 settings. So now I've got to spend $50+ on an amp to be satisfied. Just saying, if you want to hear everything and watch movies, you may just want to go ahead and spend more on something that's amplified.

  I bought the Hyperx Cloud stinger a month ago, because the many reviews and feedbacks. Almost all of them are good. But for my experience, it hasn’t been that good. First of all the sound is very low, even if you switch the volume to the max, you don’t really feel like is the max volume, also, there is not noise cancelation AT ALL, which is a big inconvenience, people is talking in the back an you can get them. the weight is good and the material is great. Microphone works ok. Overall I think that you can get better than the Hyperx , I was really expecting something different.

Great at first, but did not last long.
","

  When I had first bought this headset, the quality was perfect, and still is. The headset is breathable, and even feels greats on top of my rather large head. The sound quality was great for the price as well, even allowing to hear even the more quiet things, like footsteps in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. However it has been almost 8 months since then, and after my prolonged use of the headset, the left ear has stopped working. I had been keeping this headset in great shape, and never leaving in places where it may get easily destroyed or impacted, but while talking to friends in my Playstation party, the audio had stopped entirely in the left ear. I tested the headset on my LG K30 phone, and still, the left ear stopped working. Everything else in the works(right ear and microphone), but there is no audio in the left ear coming through.If you are buying this headset, trust me its a good headset, however be wary that the headset may stop working when it came to audio. If you may be wary because of this, try the other Hyper X headsets, which work just as amd even better than the Cloud Stinger.(This is the only thing that killed my rating for the headset. If the headset didn't stop working, this would be a 5 star review)

  I used this headset for a while now and all of the sudden the headset didn't work properly. The headset made people I was talking sound very low which meant I couldn't here them and It made music and sounds in game sound distorted or louder then usual so it was really hard to listen to things in games.

  Bought these for my 9 year old little brother for Christmas and he likes them a lot. I was worried they would be too big but they fit his head well. I was also worried about some reviews saying they break pretty quickly but almost 2 months in and they’re still fully functional. My little bro has a tendency to leave them on the floor and drop them by accident but they’re still going strong. Convenient because he can just plug them straight into the PS4 controller without having to charge them or anything.

  Incredibly cost efficient gaming headset. I’ve had it for about a year in a half now (using on PS4), and absolutely no issues whatsoever. Very durable; I’ve dropped it a few times and no cracks or anything.Sound quality is fantastic for the price. Of course you can get better, but for $50 you can’t go wrong.Flip up mic control is very efficient and nice. Easy to tell when the mic is on and off, rather than an in line control, and the mic quality is great.Comfort of the headphones is fantastic, surrounds the ear with room left over.Definitely would buy a HyperX if I wanted an upgrade.

  Bought new at a store, so not an Amazon purchase but here it goes.1 star, that's it... I had this for 6 months, took care of it, and it gets staticy as hell now. I have to fix it by messing with the mic and bending it. My friends all have to tell me my mic is messed up, and that doesnt do the trick, so I have to keep it off in games.If you can't guarantee quality out of a product for longer than six months, you dont deserve a star at all, really. Not to sound bitter, but I think that's a fair statement. You're pretty much selling trash. Useless material that's supposed to be a functional product. It is what it is. When you buy something for the first time and you find out its junk, you bought experience and a lesson learned. If I go through this a second time, the only fool is me, so I'm out on HyperX products.Sure, maybe I just got a bad individual product but I'm sure as hell not spending that money again to find out when theres other options. Going with a different brand this time and keeping my receipt!

  Headset is comfortable and has good sound.  If it lasted, it would be a great value.  Headset was used on an Xbox One controller.  It was kept in the controller at all times, so there wasn't any repetitive removing and reinserting of the jack. Upon contacting customer service, first agent approved my return but my proof of purchase didn't attach.  Second agent assisted, followed by an email to return the defective headset without a return label.  Customers should be provided with a courtesy return label for defective items that don't last a year.  We have 3 HyperX headsets.  We don't plan to purchase anymore from Kingston.

Mic didn't work
","

  I bought this headset for my teenage gamer. The headset was comfortable and had decent sound quality. The biggest issue was the mic. For the most part it didn't work. When it did work his friends could barely hear him & he would cut out. They said he sounded like he was in a tunnel and there was a constant high pitched whining noise. (From the mic, not my teenager lol) He tried adjusting settings on his computer without success. He also tried it on the xbox and had the same results. He stated even if it did work the mute function of having to raise the mic was annoying. He wears glasses & would bump them when raising the mic. Not a huge deal, but with the mic not really working anyway he said he wouldn't order another with this function. While trouble shooting he found a lot of articles about this set having detrimental mic issues. (Shame on us for not doing our homework prior to purchasing.) He wound up pitching in his own money for something more expensive and higher quality. I think our expectations were just too high for a set at this price point.

  2 years and counting, overall this is a great headset. Sturdy construction, comfortable, stable and responsive boom mic, volume control slider on the right earphone, and a decent price. Something I’ve noticed with other headsets is that the earphone pads will eventually dry out and crack, but this baby still looks like new. Only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because the audio connections might be starting to wear down, I have to adjust the jack sometimes to make sure sound is coming out evenly from both earphones - sometimes the right side drops out. Considering I use this thing for hours every single day of the week, It’s been holding up extremely well though. I would absolutely consider buying this product again in the future.

  I bought these because I finally broke my Logitech G430 after 2 years - I was pretty unhappy with the way they broke as it showed just how flimsy they can really be.So I bought these Hyper X Cloud Stingers, because they looked better built, and seemed to have decent reviews.Turned out the construction and materials used is pretty much identical to the G430...Decent audio quality, but the microphone quality is absolutely awful.The microphone also picks up audio played through the headset, so whatever game you're playing, or music you're listening to your friends will hear as well, unless you turn it waaaay down.The microphone mute doesn't seem to truly mute the mic either. It no longer picks up any noise you make but you can still hear background static.This was at least the case for me.Adjusting levels, using noise suppression etc. did not help.This is in no way a $50 headset.I would put it at the same level as the $20 SADES headset I used in 2016.I'm returning these and buying another G430 for $10 less.

  Bought this headset to replace my old PX11, which was falling apart after 8 years of use. Good sound quality but I just could not get the mic to work, which was half the reason I bought it. Changing settings on my computer made the mic either far too quiet for anyone to hear me or added too much static to the mic to the point where it was irritating. Spent 3 days doing research and trying to figure it out, but could never get the mic to work properly. A lot of other people report having the same problems. It might of been a hardware issue with my computer, but I'll never know. Ended up giving up and just returning and buying a used PX11. It was too much of a hassle

  I got a pair for each of my boys.  They each wanted ""gamer"" headphones.  After doing some research, I settled on these.  My boys are very happy with them.  They say that they can hear background noises in games such as Fort Nite that they couldn't before.  Excellent sound quality.  Also, the fold-up mic is nice.  My 8th grade and 6th grade boys are happy, so I'm happy with the purchase.

Broken splitter cable
","

  The headphones are really nice and comfortable, this coming from someone who can sit at the computer for 14+hrs a day. BUT the mic/headset splitter cable that came with the headphones was busted and doesn't work for audio. (So i can either get audio and no mic or no audio but a working mic). So I'll have to get another cable, which they aren't too expensive, but it's annoying/not preferable.

I Prefer the stingers over Cloud Alpha
","

  Been using this headset for 2 years now and it’s easily the best headset I’ve owned. The on ear controls and the raise to mute mic are great features. Sound quality it great. Even though they are mostly plastic. They are VERY durable. I recently decided to upgrade to the Hyper X cloud Alpha headset and was unimpressed and are now back to using my Stingers. My friends even commented that the mic on the Stingers sounded better to them than the Alpha. This headset is a STEAL for $50. Very underrrated.

Audio keeps cutting out on Xbox One S
","

  Fitment is not great if you have small ears and a smaller head. I am using it on it's smallest setting and it's loose fitting and slips and slides on my head. For comparison, I tried an Astro A10 on at the store and it fit much more snug and the ear cups are great for smaller ears.The build quality is junk. It is all cheap plastic, light and not durable feeling. Seems like it will snap like a twig if used often.The audio seems ok, the mids and highs are good. The bass is lacking. This is all only when it works. The audio cuts off all the time on my Xbox, I hear static and hissing when the cord is touched. It sounds like when your computer slows down and the audio and framerates stutter and lag is what I would describe the audio cutting out as.I am returning it for something else. I did not buy this on Amazon but at a physical big box store.

Best Headset I've bought yet.
","

  First of all, I've own my pair for quite a few months now. They are used quite often, usually on a daily basis.Compared to previous sets I've own prior to this, hands down the Hypercloud has been my best set yet.Ive owned Afterglows, lvl 3 and lvl 5. Comparing those to this pair is quite a difference.With the Afterglow, by now, the connection would be getting severed inside the cord. I have yet to have a single issue with connection.Material wise, it's quite comfortable. As I wear glasses, I have zero pressure from the headset.Sound quality is good. I've had no problems at never picking up any sound. If I had to nitpick over anything, I would say I wish I could adjust it for more bass at times.Listening to music through them however, provides a great quality. Make no mistake that the quality is poor, it's just my personal preference.The Afterglow lvl 5 had the best bass control to date. Though the set required batteries. I didn't think I would be satisfied using any other. Though I still own a pair, I continue to use the Hypercloud exclusively.For the price, durability, to the sound quality, I have zero regrets.

  The sound quality is not the greatest. 3 stars out of 5. But more importantly I bought this headset because I needed a mic. At first I had no issues with the quality of the mic sound but about after a month of use it started to make static noises from time to time. Sometimes it will work great and then when I go to talk again, my friends won't be able to hear me or what I am saying. I tried to return/exchange even pay more for another one of the same brand but product support closed on the 4th and they won't let me do anything about it. Also the flip up to mute function does not work. It never worked from the beginning. Very disappointed in hyperX.

  I bought this headset for my son to use with his Xbox. It barely lasted 7 months. The microphone fell apart and no longer works. The headset is in otherwise pristine condition. This issue was not due to rough use. I called Kingston technical support. They would not lift a finger and the part is not replaceable so we now have a $50 paperweight. It's a shame that it is poorly made and Kingston support doesn't care about their customers.

  I bought this as a Xmas gift. It sat while he used another one. Now he finally goes to use them and they do not work. I don't even have the box but I am very disappointed. If it breaks down when not being used can you imagine if it was being used? Stay away.

An Amazing Headsey To Gift To Yourself Or Others!
","

  I bought this headset as a gift for a fellow friend who used to call me as we talked through our games. It’s been a little over a month now, and I am highly jealous of his headset compared to mine. Listening to very crisp and clear audio allowed his voice to be the center of attention, opposed to background audio which was, for the most part, cut out. Along with this, the distance the mic was from their mouth/nose allowed little to no heavy breathing audio to go through. When I went over to his house and tried them out however, that’s when the jealous really kicked in. The sound quality is high, and noise cancelling. When put the the highest volume I had so much trouble hearing myself talk, and it allowed music and gameplay to be stellar. My friend often uses the Xbox One, and now also has a PlayStation 4, which the headset works perfect on both platforms. Along with this, it’s very comfortable to wear. I fell asleep while listening to music, and woke up perfectly fine with the headset still on my ear, and had it on for hours while gaming at his home. I may buy one for myself sometime soon, it’s worth the low price of $50! I’d go as high as $150 to pay for these.

  Update: Now the left side for audio doesn't work at all, which is a disappointment. No damages to the headset or the wire.I've had this headset for nearing 2 years and the audio is still working great with no parts falling off. The only problem I've recently had was the padding on the headset is starting to peel on both sides on the inside and out. Little black pieces will sometimes get in the side of my hair or ears, but besides that it's a great headset.

Hyperx cloud stinger headset sounds amazing!!!
","

  I did a lot of research and comparing reviews finally settled with these, glad I did! Unbelievable headset at a $50 price range! The bass is very good/loud and pure sounding, nice hard hitting!The mids and highs are nice/crisp and clear. I like how the mic is turned off by lifting up or on by pulling it down, quick and easy.  The volume being on the right earphone is easy to adjust and gets very loud. I use these headphones on my ps4 mostly and have tried many others but this is my favorite and for a reasonable price!  It really sounds like true surround sound and helps me pin point exact direction any sounds in games are coming from.I highly recommend these headphones!I know I will be buying the same ones again if these broke for any reason.I bought them somewhere else but wanted to share my thoughts on this headset on Amazon.

  I bought these after my Logitech G430 randomly broke, like they're notorious for doing (just read its reviews, all the same issue). I got these for $50, I'd say you could do better for the price or a little bit more. The sound isn't great. Computer volume all the way up, and it feels like there's no bass. The mic is extremely quiet, I increased the boost in the control panel and it's audible now but there is an echo. Would not recommend.

Been Through 2 Pairs In 3 Months - Don't Buy!

  This HyperX Cloud Stinger Gaming Headset is really poor quality.  Sounds is excellent, but unfortunately the headphones are made very cheaply and break after only being used for a few weeks.  Been through 2 pairs in 3 months.  Will not exchange them again.  Looking for a different brand. Save yourself a hassle.  Don't buy the HyperX Cloud Stinger Gaming Headset.

  These are a good quality pair of Headphones. The plastic is nice and hard, sound is clear, and weighty in the hands (which is a plus for me). I have dropped these things more times than I would like to admit, but so far not a scratch, and the mic is clear (or so my friends on the other end of the Discord call say). If you are looking for a quality piece of headphones, I 100% recommend these. The only thing I have against these headphones is that the cord is not braided. But if that is not a problem for you, then get these headphones and I guarantee that you will not regret it.

  I've started with two of the same headsets. The first one the white wire within the mic broke. Soldering from manufacturer was subpar. The second headset, the mic doesn't engage. The manufacturer honors the warranty but the customer has to pay for shipping. I'm not satisfied with the product. It becomes a headache sending it back and waiting for a replacement.

  Had these headphones for about 6 months. I went to pull the jack from my controller and the male jack on the headphones cracked and fell apart. I’ve owned many sets of gaming headphones and never had any breaks over the years.I would not recommend this brand to anyone that wants a product that will last, I will personally be going back to turtle beach brand in the future, and further more I will probably be visiting a store for my purchase so I know if I have problems, I can just bring back the product without issues.

  The headset heats up when I use it too much. Warms my ear which I don't like. I like the sound and the build quality. The mic is alright it is not bad but not meant for making YouTube videos or live streaming on Twitch. The mic is mostly used for CS:GO or Fortnite where you talk to people in the game. I like the 90 degree ear cups.

  Sound quality is good, really good bass, microphone quality good, clear and loud, comfort is extremely good in my opinion, even for someone with a fairly small head. Only complaint is its super fragile, the microphone plastic covering chipped off and I had to super glue it back on, so the material isn't the sturdiest just be careful

  Had been using this for one day now. I wore it for several hours, hasn’t lost its comfort and doesn’t make my ears warm plus very light weight.  I love the ear cups great comfort and doesn’t lose its shape/comfort. Mic is great too,  it’s very clear and doesn’t alter your voice.  Even if you’re speaking loud on the mic it won’t give that annoying screeching sound when you are being loud. Had these for a few months

  First off this isn’t a bad headset.  The sound quality is amazing, it cancels all the sound around you, and the headset is super comfortable, but when I plugged in the headset to my controller and I talked in party chat nothing showed up.  But I could hear thr sounds of my game just fine. (NOTE THIS IS ON XBOX)  if you are solo player this headset is perfect for you,  but this headset doesn’t work for talking .
