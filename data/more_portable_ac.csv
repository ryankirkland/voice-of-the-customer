Cools great, great for travel or your desk
","

  A nice little fan you could keep on your desk or bring with you to travel. Very nice that it is rechargeable with the same cord you could charge your phone or other accessories with. Very cool when you add ice or water to it. I see many uses for this little fan and will bring it whenever I travel.

Amazing

  Didn't really didnt know what to expect when I order this product. When. I am working in my office it get so hot and I dont ahave a ac in there. I try a fan but it blows hot air. So I found this product and decides to give it a shot. To my surprise it blew me away. I put it together and plugged it in and in a few seconds it was blowing cold air. I'm just happy that whoever came up with this is a very smart person. I highly recommend this. Hope you love it as well as I do.

  This does not really cool more than a normal fan.I have yet to see the ionizing lights turn onAfter 3 days it started making a weird sound as well. The sound occurs only on the lowest fan speed setting.It still works, but this is definitely no air conditioning unit.

Not that as big but it does a great job

  When I first opened the box, I thought this little thing would not work.  My company is trying to save money and at times will not turn in the ac.  But when I used it in my cubicle at work, it provided the extra comfort I needed.  It does work better with ice cubes.  Make sure it’s chipped because it cubes maybe too big to fit through.  I would definitely recommend this product.  Looks maybe deceiving, but it’s a great product

Good Portable Fan
","

  Ever since the pandemic started, I have started working from home and had to setup a home office make myself comfortable working for long hours. The only missing part was a source of continuous fresh air as I was used to with in an office. So I decided to to go for a small portable fan which can help me with continuous fresh air while I am working. I came across this fan and has been using it for quite a long time now. I also carry it while I go for a road trips and can use while on beach or any other place. Its very easy to use as it has 3 speed levels and sturdy build. It can throw cool air or hot air depending on the type of water you add into it. It doesn’t throw huge air but kind of optimum for office purpose. I can say its good fan but not sure about its worth. Its good to have it.

This works great especially now during the summer heat in Louisiana, and it’s so easy to charge too. I just plug it in with the USB on any outlet and it works for hours on its own charge. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for some cool air circulation that can be brought anywhere!

Be Cool
","

  It is a simple and small personal evaporative cooler! Sure it works with just water OK, but try tiny ice cubes from the Yueton 160 Tray Silicone Frozen Mini Cube Ice Mold Candy Chocolate Jelly Mold (White). They are just what you need to make it chill! Remove some of the filter paper inserts to make room then pack it with these tiny ice cubes, but do not totally block the airstream of the fan. If you remove 4 inserts, you will have a spare set for later. Add ice in the water tray as well with only a little water; just covering the bottom - very shallow. The overall ice melt will add to the water reservoir. It will take a couple of minutes to actually have a real cooling effect! Really don't see how normal size ice cubes can make this truly work and cool you! Tiny ice is the secret to real coolness with this great little rechargeable fan!

In addition to the cooling effect the air it blows is humid and this helps me because I often get really dry nose and bloody noses at night.

  My girlfriend and I love going to the beach and we were looking for something to cool us down while were sitting under the umbrella. In Florida the heat is crazy and sometimes it feels like you can't breath. Thats why we bought this little mini air conditioner and it does the trick. It is completely wireless so you can take it anywhere you want to go. All you have to do is add water to the tank and it blows out cool refreshing cool air. It is also light in weight and the battery lasts about 6 hours which is a lot longer than I thought. If your looking for a portable ac you can take anywhere I defiantly recommend this one.

  This is the best invention for an office since the USB tower!! I love love the mini AC. The most is not so much that you feel wet but enough that you feel cool. Great idea; works perfect !However, in between working perfectly, it stops working. For about two minutes. Then starts again randomly. Lol. I don’t mind but just throwing that out there.

Cool 😎

  Kind of awkward to get back together and add ice. It's pretty loud which I'm okay with bc I use the sound to help me sleep. It blew cold for about 2 minutes then the water warms up and it's basically just a rechargable fan. But it's pretty neat if you were camping or something for a little something extra.

It's just a tiny fan.  Nothing else.
","

  I cannot understand all the 5-star reviews, which is the entire reason I purchased this.  First off, it's the smallest, tiniest little fan!  I have a small hand and I could palm it in one hand.  You put water in this tiny little compartment.  It holds less than 1/4 cup of water.  Instructions say you can add ice cubes but that is hilarious.  Unless you have ice chips, you can't fit even one regular sized ice cube anywhere!  I gave it 30 minutes to see if it would cool and it was sitting on my desk only one foot from my face.  All I felt was a regular fan.  A tiny, tiny, tiny fan.  For over $35 after tax, this is absolutely insane.  Save yourself the headache of this ridiculous tiny plastic fan and do not buy!

No worries about running out the battery, since you could also charge It in your car, or even with a power bank.It’s extremely easy to use.. The instructions are clear and easy to follow and once you get the hang of it, it’s a breeze!!I put an ice bag on top, on really on hots. after turning on the air a few minutes later...  there is an even more cooling breeze. I have found that using the ice is actually much more refreshing than using cool water..totally cooling me down, even on the hottest humid days we experience in New England.It’s so adorable, lightweight and compact.Amazingly powerful and quiet little device!!Overall, I love it, Totally worth the price.. highly recommended!

Most importantly, it is quiet. The instruction provided by the manual is intuitive and easy to use.

  Got this AC for camping. I was really worried about the battery before I purchase it but after my first use, I was happy because it lasted more than 5 hours with the first charge which is really good. The device is very light and you can carry it anywhere you want. I have it in my trunk for camping.Update:Even though this device is very cute but I'm reducing the rate to 3 stars since the item is not blowing air as much as I was expecting.

Easy portable and cool air

  When my son and I sat at the back seat, the air conditioner of my car doesn't seem to be working than the front seat. So we took this product out for our short road trip (about 5 hours) today. This product is so light-weight and small size, so we had a cool and comfortable trip. Compared to regular fans we used before, this product can slightly cool the air and very be suitable for a small space like in a car. It really helps my son have a good sleep in car seat during hot summer.

Gamechanger in this humid heat!
","

  I've used this for about 3 weeks now. It is FANTASTIC! Its quiet, lightweight, and portable. We dont have central air. I've used it all over the house; in the kitchen when I'm cooking over a hot stove, in my bedroom at night, in the bathroom. The air is alwaaaaay cooler than just using a fan. It's not as crisp and cold as an air conditioner, but it's pretty close. Its definitely a personal device. It's not going to cool down a room. Its will cool down the person its aimed at, though. I've even taken it to the drive in with me. My local drive in requires all cars to turn off their engines, so it can get hot and uncomfortable.  I plugged it into an external battery pack and I had cool air blowing on me for the whole movie. Once the battery is charged, it'll run anywhere from 1.5 to 5 hrs depending on what speed you have it set at. But if you leave it plugged in, it'll go for 9+ hrs, basically until the water tank runs out. I cant say enough good things about this, it's my favorite purchase of the summer!

  due to working from home condition, I try to work from my backyard as it gets very depressing to be inside the home all the time. The summer sun has been a damper to this concept. I was looking for a portable air cooler so that I can use it in the backyard. This is perfect for that!!!To get the best cooling, please add in several ice cubes and then ice cold water. This really helped with the cool breeze. The usb-c charger is universal and it is great to keep it plugged into my laptop as well if needed. I have got about 5 hours of continuous operation on battery and it has been good.

Compact and powerful portable ac
","

  The size is perfect not big.  I can easily place it near by a window or on a desk since it does not occupy too much space.  The reason I bought this is to use it in my computer room as currently I am working from home 3 to 4 days a week.  Also my computer room is on the top floor which is the hottest area in the house.  This portable ac comes handy.  I just place it on my desk and the cool air starts blowing.  I do feel much better to work from home now.It’s better to soak the inside part in water because it does help cool down hot air.  If i want to be much cooler, I can just simply place some ice cubes in the top container.  Cold air does coming out to enjoy.  This little product can help reduce some electric costs.Besides great things I mentioned above, it can be used as a humidifier so the room does not get too dry.  My skin is easy breaking due to dry air.  I have been using this product for almost a week.  I can see a positive result that my skin is in a better condition now.Overall, it’s a product which you won’t regret of buying.

helps keep me cool while working at home in the summer time

  i'm often the hotter one in the house and we try not to blast the air conditioner to high to save electricity. this is a great solution to provide localized cool air. it's a portable fan that blows cool air utilizing a reserve of water that slowly is released. i load the water section with ice cubes so that the water will be extra cool and possibly have less mess if it tips over.one good feature that i especially like is that it is usb-c powered. since i use it close to my computer, if i have to give it an extra charge, i can just use my computer charger easily.

worth every penny
","

  I've been searching for a portable AC/cooler that I can use in my bedroom where there's no windows.  This is not a cheap device based on its size and capacity.  However, it is also a lot more cost friendly compare to those brand names/ larger capacity machines.  It's been super hot this month and a fan is no long enough to cool down the room during sleep.  After reading all the reviews among similar products, I decided to give GtTech Portable Air Conditioner a try.  To be honest, I didn't give myself much hope on this little thing and was already thinking about return it before first use.I received this little cooler 10 days ago and I still remember the night I first use it, it is truly a LIFE SAVER!!!!!  I had my best sleep in months.  I even need to keep my blanket on so I don't get cold and it's very dangerous to get cold this days because of Covid-19 especially you could lose your job because of it...I have been using it every single night for the past 10 days and I have to say it worth every penny.  The price for its compact size is a good deal I would say because it does not take up much space in my already lack of space room...What I like it even more is the soft lighting feature it offers.  Not only it has different colors you can choose from, you can also turn it off.If you are also looking for a personal AC/Cooler , this GtTech Portable AC/Cooler will not let you down and you will not regret.  It's already on my Christmas gifting list for this year ;)

  I live in NY and it's been really hot for the past few weeks and sometimes having the AC running the whole night wakes me up in the middle of the night, so I decided to try this in hopes of a better sleep.Upon opening it, it didn't have much instructions, but it was simple enough to understand.I charged it out of the box and it took about 2 hours to fully charge it and the first time I ran it, it went for about 2 hours on the battery at highest setting.  It's not noisy and it does feel nice and cool after you've soaked the filter and put water in it.The next night I ended up plugging it in so it would last the whole night and I was still feeling the cooling effect when waking up.I'm pretty pleased with the product and wouldn't mind getting it as a gift for someone.

Best Portable AC Fan I've ever had
","

  I have a work office in the garage and it gets very hot during summer. I have tried many different kinds of portable AC and none of them came close. This fan can be moved anywhere on my desk due to its own battery(which can last a long time) and doesn't need to be plugged in all the time like the other ones i've had. The cooling part is very very consistent as in that blue filter doesn't dry out and the spray from the water tank is really good to keep it moist. I love how i can charge the battery with USB C (faster charge and easier to connect). The lighting part is a big plus as it seems to give me good mood or add color around my boring color office (the others have no lighting at all). I would pick this over all the other portable AC.

  It's summer, and my house is very hot and stuffy during this time. I do not want to turn on the central when I only need the bedroom to cool down.  This little fan is very interesting.  It is nice, and small.  It has a night light, and 3 fan speed settings.  I poured some water into it, and turned it on.  The fan at low is pretty strong.  The spray option I guess makes the air even colder and add humidity is not too loud, but you won't be able to sleep with that sound on.  It's a nice little portable water cooled air fan.  I don't think it will cool a room by 6 degree Celsius in a short period of time though.  Good fan to cool the baby when it is sleeping.

This portable AC has made my 8 hour shifts working in the factory during this heat wave pleasant.
","

  I live in Ohio where the heat has been unbearably in the 90's for going on two weeks now. I work in a factory where if it's hot outside, it's even hotter inside and because of the products we make, we do not have good air conditioner but rely heavily on fans blowing on us. And if anyone knows about running fans in the heat, it's pretty useless because it just blows more heat.  My manager informed us that we can bring in our own fans and so I decided to look into portable air conditioners and most were too large that I would need a window to use it which of course would be impossible.  Then, I saw this small air conditioner that reminded me of something similar I've seen on a TV commercial and the price was much less than what was advertised on TV but because I was curious and comfortable with the price and because I was in dire need of something quickly for work, I decided to give it a try.  I've only had it for about about a week but I was too excited to share my thoughts on this.  I can't express enough my satisfaction of this portable AC and it's power. I was a little skeptic at first because I kept thinking where I stand and work, the way I would have to set it on, would I be able to feel anything. Well, I've had this sitting on a stool about 6 ft away from me and it really does work well. It feels as if I am sitting in front of my own living room AC.  What I do like is that you do not need an plug outlet to use this for you can charge using a usb chord. So you can charge it and it works for about 2 hours depending on the power you use it on. I have it on the 3rd power which is the highest and it does feel good.  But because it does last about 2 hours on a charge on high, I like to have it attached to my extension chord connected to the outlet to a port I have that takes usb.  But if you need to use this on charge without going more than two hours such as being outside, in the car or even in your office with no window. You can use this and it will feel like spring or fall time winds coming at you. Feels good and it gives me a sense of comfort as I am working in the hot factory.  Now, be sure to have water available because you will need to fill the top with water which is what provides that cool air and what I do is, I put ice cubes in it for that extra burst of cool air but any temp water will do since it's the fans blowing out the air.  Comes with different options of power from a low cool to a high cool and like I said before, because it's portable, you can use this anywhere. I also use this at home when I am asleep which this offers a cool feature that the top lights up with several colors using a built in led light which makes it nice to sleep with , especially with my infant baby sleeping in bed with me. You can adjust the fan shutter from blowing the air directly on you to moving it up to maybe push the heat up away from you.  It's super quiet and it really doesn't take long to cool off, I say it is almost immediately how fast it cools me off at work.  It comes with a strap where you can easily carry it anywhere and you can sit it on anything from the grassy yards when enjoying the night starts, to my coffee table while watching tv.  I can attest that is a great product and I am very pleased with this purchase. I am so happy with it that I am buying another two , one to keep at work, the other to keep at home and one to give as  a gift to my friend who also works with me.

Works but is kinda loud.
","

  Design is sleek and easy to fix. However, it is pretty loud - we find it difficult to sleep with it so we shifted it to the living room. When I use it during conference calls, people think I’m in the car or ask if I’m near an engine (desk is 3m away). It does take some time to cool the room as well (living room is 28 SQM) but does help to keep the overall temperature down and therefore still a saver for a hot summer. We love the dehumidifier function.

Great unit, terrible hose
","

  The actual A/C unit is fantastic! But you better own duct tape because the hose connection to both the unit and the window is AWFUL!! It falls out even if you circle it in and it doesn’t stay no matter what. The window unit is also terrible, very cheep. It’s a shame, because the actual unit is great, cools the room immediately and doesn’t stop. I would buy again just for the power of the unit but should have a much more solid connection from both sides of the hose.

  Our master bedroom is upstairs, faces due west with very large windows and is the farthest away from the HVAC unit so in the summer, it gets hot in the evenings as the sun is going down. In order to cool our room in the evenings, the rest of the house would be frigid. This A/C unit fits the bill. All summer nights are comfortable now. It does make some noise though. It doesn’t bother us sleeping, but while watching tv. If I knew there were more quiet ones on the market that performs as well as this one, I would have paid a little more. But, definitely will not be returning or switching out. It works for us.

~~So far, excellent product~~
","

  Living in a log cabin, I have debated for several years about purchasing one of these portable units.  The ceiling is 14 feet high and didn't think a unit would cool things down much.  But, with the oppressive heat this summer ...in the mid 90's in Vermont...I decided to buy this unit.Have used it four times so far and was pleasantly surprised at how much it cooled the air in here.  The first day it was 94 outside and the temperature went down to 84 in a few hours.  That is really good for the amount of air that needs to be cooled.The unit is really quiet and another bonus for me.  In actuality it is less than the roar of the three fans I also have in here.  I did purchase the protection plan for 3 years for some added assurance.In Vermont the outside air begins to cool this time of year.  I do think this unit will be used in September for a few days and also some in October.So far, most pleased with this unit and very happy with my purchase.Will update with any important issues that I may have.Two pictures are included so one is able to see the manner in which it was vented out my window.  Plexiglass was used for the entire window and a hole was cut to vent the unit...  No problem for the man that installed the vent.Highly recommended.

My apartment was 85o when I turned AC on and 1/2 hour later I am able to breathe in 70 degrees!!  Love it!  It sits it my living area but, I can feel the cool in kitchen and bedroom!  Amazing!  Gem.

Cools Well, definitely not quiet
","

  As I recall i picked this unit because it was stated it was very quiet, can't seem to find that wording here now. In any case it DOES cool very well, can't argue that. However... When it was new it was relatively quiet. The longer we've had it (5.5 months now) it has gotten louder and louder. At first it rattled when in A/C cycle, now it frequently cycles between A/C and fan mode (i presume when it reaches the set temp in the room). When it goes into fan mode it makes a weird sound and then quiets down then kicks back into A/C mode with a bang, which wakes you up. Wish it was like our last one that finally burned out it just hummed along in a constant A/C mode. Anyway i know one of these days i'm going to return home from work and this unit will just be ""gone"" and my wife won't know anything about where it went i suppose. One plus note when the unit first arrived the remote fried after one button push and they sent me a whole second A/C unit, that one resides in my four year olds room and it has performed somewhat quieter however it too cycles frequently which can disturb his sleep.

  This little air conditioner is fantastic.  Measured the temperature of the output at 55 degrees in full blast  I use it primarily in a shed that's 20ftx10ft with 14ft ceilings and all the insulation of a paper bag.  It takes about 5 mins to drop the temperature from 100 to 85, and another 10 mins to get it to 75 degrees.  It has a lowest temperature setting of 64 degrees, but I'll never see that in my shed; it'd easily cool to 65 degrees if placed in an insulated room.Noise level is low for an air conditioner and about on par for a floor fan.  You can easily have a conversation.Let it sit for 24 hours when it arrives to make sure the refrigerant and oil settle and you're good to go.

  When received it worked well.  I was irritated that it didn’t turn off when reaching the desired temp but instead ran the fan 24/7.

(See attached picture)I have to cycle through numbers to figure out a puzzle of what’s being displayed.Now it’s not cooling hardly at all.  It’s set to 68 and it’s almost 89 degrees in the room.  The room is 10x9, well below the maximum room size by a lot.My electric bill jumped through the roof.  I expected it to go up but it shouldn’t be drawing this much current for such poor performance.Purchased earlier this year and is outside Amazon repair warranty.

  I bought the 10,000 BTU air conditioner. I’m using it to cool my living room and kitchen. I stretched it’s limits By about 50 ft.², because I didn’t want it to be too big or heavy. It really makes a big difference, even though it can’t keep up As well as a larger unit probably would. It’s been getting to be 90 to 100° Lately, and the sun really beats down on my living room. Also, my refrigerator has been putting out more heat, to keep its contents cool. Sometimes I have to run my dishwasher or cook something. That also increases the heat load. Still, I don’t believe the temperature inside has climbed above 85 Degrees. I usually just leave it running nonstop when it gets like this. I live in California, and we’re getting a lot of smoke from wildfires. We cannot open our windows to let in the cool air at nighttime!  This little unit has been a lifesaver!

  This AC unit worked well at first. My room is about 100 square feet, and would be icy cool after having the unit on for a few hours. However, now that I've had the unit for about 2 months, I've noticed that the dehumidifier no longer works, and it no longer drains water. I've attempted to solve the problem myself, but to no avail. And even after having the AC unit on all day, my room is at best a few degrees cooler than outside. This should easily be able to cool my tiny room. Of course, since these problems slowly started after a month of having the AC unit, I can no longer get a refund. Waste of money.

  As with all portables, it's noisier and not as efficient as a window unit. Having said that, it's done its job. I really think it deserves 4.5 stars, but it's noise level, for a portable, is a bit louder than I'd like.

It's an air conditioner, but 10k btus??
","

  Okay, so we have been having alot of very hot days. Like HOT days. This unit has done very good in keeping my living room nice and cold, but just the living room. You don't feel any of that beyond the threshold to the dining room. The thermostat right around the corner from the living room (which is the dining room) usually reads 78-80F so I know I'm not just crazy. The window AC that I replaced with this one was only 5k btus and managed to keep almost both the living room and half the dining room cooled down. So I have a hard time believing 10k.Noise level is average for a portable unit. Which means yes, it is somewhat noisy. Go outside and stand next to your window AC. That compressor is inside the portable unit. If you want it to condition air, then it has to be noisy lol.As much as we've run it we haven't had to drain it, and it's not leaking anywhere, so that's a plus.It works....average, which is why I gave it three stars. It does what it's supposed to, sorta.

  Eats a lot of electricity, air coming out of the unit pretty goes nearly straight up, the vent is not useful in redirecting forward.  Will only cool a small room.  Vent does not stay in the window well, could use better thinking through.  The hose coming out the back makes it a beast to maneuver in a small area.  Overall if I had to make a suggestion, it would be to use a window unit instead.

Best portable unit for the price!
","

  Wasn’t sure what to expect with the mixed reviews, but this unit works great!! Ignore the bad reviews. Its actually pretty quiet (compared to the Honeywell 10000btu machine I had before). Sure, you need to turn the TV up when the A/C is running, but you forget about it pretty much instantly. And when it’s just the fan running, it’s remarkably quiet. Cools my entire ~400 square foot living room in 10 minutes, but you feel the cool air filling the room instantly. Remote control is easy to use and the unit has a lot of functionality: different modes (a/c, fan only, dehumidifier), different fan speeds, and optional oscillating vent direction. Window insert was easy to set up, although you may have to put some insulation below it to get it to sit high enough so that the tube doesn’t pop out, if your window sill is flush with the bottom of the opening section, like mine is. But they provide more than enough insulation strips. The unit is actually pretty small and looks sleek, especially with the LED info screen that shines through the front wall. I did a lot of shopping around before picking this unit, and I am confident that I chose the best one. Very pleased with the purchase :)

Ok product with some problems
","

  Personally, I think it's an OK product, what is an OK product? Just what you need, but with flaws.1. really noisy, because it's a small air conditioner, so it's usually placed in a bedroom or other smaller room so that when I'm working, I'm often interrupted by the noise from the air conditioner and even have to resort to silent earplugs when I'm sleeping.2. for some reason, after a few weeks of use, in dehumidification mode, the air vents of the air conditioner began to have a faint moldy smell, although it disappeared after switching to cooling mode, I am still very concerned about the moldy condition inside the air conditioner. I don't know if this is an isolated case or what, I'm just voicing my problem.Other than that, this air conditioner is perfectly suited to a variety of rooms and easily cools the entire room.  If you're ok with the aforementioned issues, this air conditioner is still good.

A little noisy. But a very good AC.
","

  Ordered this a few days ago to cool my mid-size studio apartment, and thus far it works great. Has a sleek design and handy remote for controlling the unit. The AC also came with 3 window panel adapters which was long enough to seal my tall vertical window. Assembly was easy and it seems to be able to cool my entire apartment really effectively.The one downside is that the ""silent"" mode is not at all silent. I would equate it to the noise level of having two fans on high. BUT its not unbearable, and thus far the cooling aspect makes it worth dealing with the noise.

  Great machine: it is nice, white and clean. The only issue -- the tube was really hot which heats up the room. I got a Cool-Aide and that took care of it (see the photo of the tube insulator attached).

  Based on reviews and someone I know confirming - bought because I was told it doesn't cycle itself off every x number of hours to give the compressor a break or whatever it's doing...  If you want one that doesn't shut off during the middle of the night and the deafening lack of sound that follows - look elsewhere.  Cools, works, does the job - it just shuts down and I was looking for something that stayed on constantly.  Maybe an unrealistic hope, but at least one that ran 6 - 8 hours so it didn't wake me in the middle of the night when it went off.  Your results may vary.  :-P

  We have a 2 bedroom apt and it can actually cool down the livingroom/kitchen area after an hr on medium setting. If the AC is used in a bedroom it gets pretty cold pretty fast. The fan noise is really quiet, the AC noise its a little louder but you can get use to it.NOTE that when using the AC and when it reaches the Tº desired it switches to fan mode, but when ambien Tº goes up it goes back to AC mode, so If you sleep with the AC in your bedroom, the noise that you get when it switches from fan to AC can be a little loud so be prepared to have that a couple times a night.Other than that this is a great portable AC, we're very happy with the purchase.

  10k BTU was recommended to me for my 1 bedroom apartment and just for the bedroom. I bought the 12k BTU just to be on the safe side and also I sleep better when the bedroom is ice cold. My old AC which was 8K BTU was a hand-me-down from my mother in law for when my wife and I moved in a few years back. So we finally replaced it with this unit and it’s been a huge disappointment. How on Earth a 10 year old 8K BTU beat up window unit kept the room cooler then this unit???People warned me about how much portable units are a waste and I ignored them thinking they were exaggerating.I WAS WRONG!!! In order for us to feel SOME air, the unit has to be next to the bed and we have to keep the blankets off.The unit can run all day but the temp in the room stays in the 70s even though the unit is set to 64.The 8K BTU that’s over 10 years old kept the room at 68-69 when set to 60 degrees but the 12k struggles to keep it under 75 degrees????Then ontop of that, you got that SUPER BRIGHT LED that lights up the whole room with no option to dim.I would return this unit if it wasn’t a hassle to return it so I feel I’m stuck with it.Will move this unit to the living room in then near future and I’ll buy a window unit from Costco as recommended by people who say their AC cools their entire apartment and their room is icy cold.

  It's not the quietest AC unit ever, but it's also not the loudest. The sound is unobtrusive, sounds like your normal every day air conditioner with a little oomph to it. Cooled my entire room it was purchased for in less than half an hour, to 69F. Before we had to use 2 separate units to achieve that, and now it's just one. Set up was super easy and straight forward, though I do have smaller (and much much older than normal) windows and had to trim about 4 inches off the slider piece but that was no problem for me.Overall I'm super pleased and happy with this air conditioner.

  Bought this to replace a different brand that had failed after five years of continuous service.  We use a 25ft racing trailer as a storage unit and exhaust out the roof vent with the drain going out a bottom hole I drilled for that purpose.It doesn't keep the trailer (insulated) as cool as the other but it is quieter and more energy efficient (measured).  The energy efficiency may be due to it not cooling as well.It hit 80F a few weeks ago and it supposed to be 95 this weekend so I'll test it out and update.  As long as it keeps it around 80 or less I'll stay with it.  Otherwise, I'll replace it later this summer.As far as I can tell it does dehumidify well.

  The ground on the plug is a bad design, it's round instead of semi- triangular like a normal ground and when I tried to unplug from the wall it ripped the ground off the plug and left it wedged into the outlet and I couldn't get it out so I had to shut off power at the beaker and replace the outlet. So now my AC has no ground. This is the only thing that I I found flawed in the design and system. Blows pretty cold and cools a good sized area. You just have to monitor the water level when it needs to be drained. I just put a hose on mine so it is always draining.

  I purchased this item and it arrived in beautiful condition. It was packed perfectly. Everything about dealing with this item has been good. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I worked at troubleshooting why the compressor would not kick in, working through the instructions in the pamphlet that accompanied the a/c unit, nothing worked. I tried for two weeks. I hated to let this thing go. It is beautiful. It is quiet. It worked well as a fan. But I just couldn't get the unit to work as an air conditioner. Reluctantly I contacted the company and they are excellent in customer service. They worked with me in every way. I am not awaiting a call tag for UPS to have it picked up. I am giving this air conditioner a five-star rating because of the excellent customer service. No hassles, no difficulties. And the item is really a beautiful piece. Disappointed, but not disheartened. Thank you NINGPU for being so nice.

  Here are some notes from our experience:1. The story:My son bed room that is always hotter than the rest of the house. So far we like the unit a lot. It has only been a few days, but definitely the most important thing is it has massively improved the living conditions in his room in the last few days. For sure it isn’t quiet (=60dBA) and I’ll say it makes lesser noise than the window A/C unit would produce. He has no trouble sleeping with it through the night.2. The NINGPU portable A/C unit:First off, the packaging was awesome which is something that everyone usually overlook. All I had to do was cut a few straps and I was already in business plus the installation was simple. Due to the room layout, I bought a counterclockwise JOYOOO (79 inches) 5.9 Inch Diameter Intake/Exhaust Hose PVC Flexible Ducting for Portable Air Conditioner to replace the included extendable exhaust hose not long enough (59 inches). That helps the efficiency and it will NOT sag to the floor which hurts airflow. This portable A/C unit blows ice cold air and cools down a 300-350 square feet room to 74 degrees fast and in no time. IT HAS CONTROLS ON THE UNIT ITSELF. This is simply a must I’m my opinion. Remotes get lost, break, etc., and we wouldn’t want the portable AC to become useless if the remote breaks. The controls are well thought out and function well. The timer can be set for both start up and shut down.3. The bottom line, all in all were very happy ... it’s a great portable AC and notably better than a brand name on the market.

  Completely useless in cooling you down even if you are right in front of it. The water tank is tiny. That goes for all the other similar products in similar price range so there's that.

Or spend the money for a night at hotel during the heatwave.Plus the fan just won't spin at all after just a few hrs of usage.It's really rare to see a simple product just broke down like this nowadays.

Even on the lowest fan setting, the fan keeps me quite comfortable on hot California days. Works well too up to 8 feet away on higher speeds while watching TV. It will not cool a room - the operation is directional. The fan is very quiet - water has to added after a few hours of continuous operation. We accidentally dropped the first unit with water in it. It stopped working for a while but sprung back to life after a day of air drying outside. I think the design is elegant, simple and very efficient for the operation I described. Be cool and it will be cool.

  Maaaaaannnn, I love this fan! I think it's important for people to understanding what they are getting and not expect this to be comparable to an ACTUAL AC unit. BUT, if you are like me and have no AC at all, this is so much better than just a regular fan. No its not going to cool an entire room down. But when the hottest part of the day makes my apartment miserable and my regular fans are just pushing around warm air, putting ice and cold water in this and sitting in front of it made a noticeable difference. It puts out a lot more air flow then I was expecting, and is super quiet. The only things that keep it from being WOW out of this world 5 star is the ability to tilt it up or down and if the water reservoir was a bit more insulated. With the ice there's a lot of condensation (but none of it gets in the surface the fan is on) so that just means the water doesn't stay as cool for as long. Otherwise I absolutely love this thing.

  It's okay for what it is, but is really better for short time use and if you're planning on sitting near it while using. Need to put ice in water tank to make the air cold but the opening for the tank is very very small. If you just use cold water, the air it pushes out isn't much colder than if you were to use the fan alone. Also, even when filling water to max line, it only lasts for about 2-3 hours depending on speed you put it on. Definitely not going to last all night during sleeping hours. I do like how quiet it is though and is a pretty good fan if that's all you want from it. A

  I bought this product based on other reviews and with next day delivery, since I ordered it on 7/22/30, I got it started immediately.I have seen other products advertised, but they seemed too primitive and got more negative reviews, since these personal coolers are fairly new to the market.I would recommend this for anyone who needs one, mind you they work best when humidity is low but you can compensate by adding ice to the water.  I live in the hot dry desert of Arizona and from time to time my apartment AC, also a swamp cooler, quits working.This little unit, even with no ice, cools the air so well, a life saver if there is an AC failure or if your office space is too hot at work.  It does not dampen things, it puts out a dry but cold and invisible mist.These units would be wonderful in places where people dwell in non air conditioned dwellings, in poor countries, or in camping grounds where tents are used.They are meant to be used close to the human body, but they could save many seniors or those adversely affected by heat due to illness, climate or trauma.  I appreciate the reviewers for recommending this product and the seller who got it delivered as promised.

I had originally bought a different one of these fans, but this one is AMAZING!

   Initially I purchased a black boxy-style from a different seller on Amazon... I needed something fast and thought a black one would look more expensive, yada yada yada... well, it looked like a big 'ol plastic vented box sitting on my desk, and I pretty much hated everything about it.My office is mostly white with gray and blue touches, so I have no idea what I was thinking when I got a black fan, but I realized that I needed to start looking at white ones, and didn't realize that they make cute LED ones... well, I'm a gamer/streamer, so my office has to have a certain aesthetic that's pleasing to the eye and pretty modern-looking or else I don't feel like I'm achieving what I want with regard to my streams. In came this fan. Now, for the price, I was hoping and praying that it would be everything I want, because paying $60+ for a desktop fan with misting and LED lights seems preeeeeeetty steep, amirite? Well. folks, this is it. This is THE fan. For me, at least. It's bigger than I expected but pleasantly so, looks VERY expensive (and, well, it WAS after all), and has such a clean aesthetic!Hopefully the video does it justice. It mists, it changes color, you can also pick the color per your mood-of-the-day, and it's really not all that loud, even on the highest setting. I have a secondary tower fan that sits behind me and oscillates and on the low setting of that fan, I can't hear this baby on its highest setting, so there's that. Not sure what that adds to this review, but I've said it.The misting function is fantastic. Some might argue that having actual mist coming out near my $1500+ setup is silly, but it's not much, and it mostly hits me so I'm good there. I'm just beyond pleased with the outcome of this purchase! Yay!

  Great little air conditioner to sit on your desk or wherever you want some portable cool air. LED lighting makes a good night light while you're sleeping. Just add some ice water and soon you'll be cool as a cucumber

refreshing
","

  Just in time to get this portable AC right before summer. This is a big relief especially in the last weeks til now that the temp here in OC is getting hot especially during the day. I’ve been running this everyday while working from home, in fan mode in the morning when it’s not that hot and in cool mode in the pm.For cool mode, I tried adding water only and it’s refreshing. Adding some ice cubes to the water as an option is a nice touch but I’m lazy to go down to get ice lol. Cool mode with just water is enough for me.One minor issue is the condensation when in cool mode (shown in the pic) but it’s not a big deal as it doesn’t drip down or making a mess at all. It’s documented in the manual that a little condensation is expected. So after use, I just tilt it back a bit and the water is gone.Overall I can recommend this portable AC.

The Next Best Thing
","

  When an AC unit isn't accessible, this is the next best thing.We live in an early 1900s home that we are slowly updating. We currently can't use window AC units in parts of the home as there are only stained glass windows that do not open.This unit actually makes a pretty big difference in air temperature in a small area around you, especially when ice is added to the reservoir.Operation is very simple as there are only 4 buttons:-Fan Speed-Timer-LED Lights-Cooling MistWater can be added to the reservoir through a small door on the back of the unit or by opening latch on the bottom of the unit. When full (there is a water fill line) the unit can cool for up to about 4 hours. When the water gets low, there is an indicator light that will turn on.During the day, this unit is next to my workstation, the fan is quiet and the cool mist really keeps the immediate area more comfortable. At night, the unit moves in to our TV room and keeps us cool in there as well.At $50 - 55 this is a good investment if you need zonal cooling or just can't get an AC unit.It has been a few weeks now and the unit has held up very well. We give it a wipe down every few days as the mist builds up around the brim.The many colors of LED lights is a nice touch and my cats are mesmerized.

I'm a fan of this fan
","

  This is my 3rd time trying to submit a review for this fan that for some inexplicable reason Amazon keeps refusing to post and will not respond to my inquiries as to why.I'm really enjoying this fan.  The more I use it the more I find to like about it.  It's very cooling.  By adding ice-water to the well the cooling is enhanced that much more.  It's small. It's compact.  It's stylish.I've been using it daily for over a week and it is much quieter than the other fans I had going.  It's not a room cooler though - it has a very limited range of impact.  For a personal fan, that's all you need.I like the colors - adds some whimsy.  I like the size.  I like that I can use my aromatherapy oils in the well as well.'I 'm not going to write too much more at this point in case Amazon refuses to publish this review as well.

Beats the Summer Heat - Personal Use - Mini Air Conditioner
","

   Why I bought it:- Needed something which could be easily kept on my desk, as I usually sit and work most of the time- Although I have a standing fan, however it doesn't cool down the air- Summer is getting too hot and I just couldn't bear the heat, also couldn’t afford an air conditioner at this timeThings I liked:- mist functionality, really cools down the hot air- provides focused air, mostly on face but does cool down areas in its proximity- convenient to pour, just pour the bottle water into the tank and switch on the mist mode- display shows everything: fan speed mode, mist mode, water sufficiency, LED light, timer- LED lights are absolutely enchanting, you can set them to individual color or shuffle mode, through button press- it's design is really cute, all curved and just seems very pretty- i have always liked white color and this one too has a sophisticated lookThings I wished it had:- rotating fan, sometimes too much focused air makes your face too cool and uncomfortable- bigger water capacity, current one runs for like an hour- long cable length, however it is perfect for me but I feel it should have more length, just in caseWill I recommend it:- Yes, I would say it is the exact product as you see in description of the product pageWill I revisit my review:- Mostly not, I have been using it on a daily basis since three weeks now and have not found any issues yet. Works absolutely fine. (haven't used the timer function yet, as I keep it ON for like entire daytime)- Also, they wrote in description that they provide 12 months warranty guaranty & unconditionally REFUND or RESEND with any quality problems, so I guess if something ever happens will try to reach them and post updates here

Parallel way to save electricity when I alone need cool air
","

  Ordered this portable AC to use it when I alone need air conditioned cold air when located in certain area of my home as my home has central AC and for me alone, if I turned on my AC, it consumed lot of electricity. This is very portable easy to use AC and I simply have to refill it with water every day after using it extended periods during the mornings and afternoons. The controls on its front are very well designed and its overall base which is used as its grip to hold is also firm enough to hold it easily without any issues and same way its wider round base is also more than enough to place it firmly on a solid surface like my Patio table and living room table. I use this mist fan at medium speed most of the times and there is little to no noise at all during its extended usage. The front cover of the fan is safe and there is no risk of my fingers accidentally touching the blades inside the fan so safety aspect is good. There is also a timer mode of 4 hours and 2 hours and I have kept the 2 hour mode On by default unless I manually turn it off before that so that feature is also handy.2 Bonus features which i did not anticipate earlier but after using this product I loved were:A) The fan when using at night time displays the wonderful 7 different colors of my choosing and if I am using it outside while chilling at my patio, it feels so refreshing at night when viewing those colors on the circular disk of the front of the fan and at the same time receiving cool mist from it in hot and humid climate.B) 3 sepearate buttons for Wind/Cool/Light so I do not have to do multiple presses on single button to change the settings or any effort in that direction. Plain simple whatever setting I need, I simply press that button on the fan and it provides me and that is all I want in hot temperatures around this time of the year.EXPERIMENT:I experimented twice by adding the cologne I have with water and ice inside the fan's tank and the mist indeed brought out so tempting fragrance outside and filled the entire surrounding area near it with this fragrance. I have since then mixed 2 different colognes I have with water and ice and used them in late evening time when simply relaxing on my patio and it felt good.For its cost, it is a good deal and savior of both my electricity bill as well as myself from the currently hot temperatures nearing almost 95 Degrees daily.

  to be stuck at home working in the home office can be really boring. so i bring out my laptop and lemonade to enjoy the beautiful clean air. but it's been getting soooo hot. i use to be able to work outside all day with no problems. just the past couple of weeks i can't even stay out there past 10am. it's already 85 degrees by that time.i was looking for a small fan that would use water and ice to cool air blown at me. i read the reviews and tried this one. it works better than i thought it would. mind you that i had very low expectations. but filled with water and ice really keeps me cool. of course i still can't stay out in the patio for the whole day but i can stay there until 12pm. i go into the office to work a couple of hours then finish the day outside at 3pm with the fan after the sun was at it's fullest intensity.its really quite and can do conference/zoom meetings while it's about 2 feet away and no one hears it. i use filtered cold water from the fridge so i never had any cleaning problem. i would make sure it's empty and dry after each use to it doesn't develop mold. i like the light and timer feature. i haven't had to use it but the light is pretty cool. kids like to turn it on at night with the fan blowing. great product.for the newer model i wish the had black as a color. white gets dirty really fast. also next model hopefully has rechargeable batteries or battery option along with the cord. it'll just make it that much more versatile

Perfect for Summer!
","

   With the temperature rising, this is the perfect solution for people (like me) who is trying to save money on their electric bill! It's hard to find a portable ac that you can easily store when it's not needed but does the job when you need it to! This is the perfect size that it doesn't occupy much space on the desk or the floor (if I'm working on the floor). It keeps me cool for a few hours just by adding water. Condensation will begin after 20 mins but not to the point of leaking on the desk or the floor. It's easy to clean/ dump the water as the plug is detachable. Carry to the sink and dump or fill with water.Added bonus is the cool light option when you have this on at night. It serves as your night light and your ac. It's not loud which allows you to sleep peacefully.

The water drawers works more effectively with ice water or we put frozen ice pack in there, just keep it away from the arm that comes down and draw water and you are all set.

  For the price I am honestly satisfied with my purchase! As soon as it got here i set it up and my room temperature felt much cooler within 45-1 hour. Its pretty easy to set up and would recommend to use ICE for cooler results. Overall Im please and excited to not be sweating all day  !!!Only reason why Im giving it a 4 star is because my room doesnt feel as cold as i was anticipating -_- and read from the other comments, however it DOES work meaning it cools the place down a bit....BUY IT if you cant stand this heat!!!!!

  I purchased this as a gift for my daughter who's AC had just failed. The delivery date was August 25th -27th but it arrived on the 22nd. OUTSTANDING!! She said it started to cool her condo down within 5 minutes on a 96 degree day in Colorado and she was finally able to sleep through the night. She's happy so I'm happy.

A life saver in the dry Nevada heat- but the price changes
","

  If you are thinking of purchasing this unit, watch the price a bit because I have seen it fluctuate by almost $50. I have had the unit for a week now in the middle of a major heat wave in Nevada. Temps have gotten up to 110 degrees fahrenheit. My room is south facing and was getting up to 100 degrees inside during the day because our upstairs air conditioning barely works anymore, especially during this heat. The unit, when filled with room temperature water, lasts over 6 hours for us even on max level. It keeps the room at 71 during the day and it has even gotten down to 68 at night. It really works in a small room with no moisture. The unit did produce a bit of weird smelling air the first night, but it just smelled like wet cardboard and I never smelled it again after the first night. It is easy to fill up and use, and I love that it comes with a remote.

  We have little to no AC in our apartment so it had been unbearable when the temperatures went up into the 100s. Unit came a earlier than predicted and is very light so it’s easy to move around. Unfortunately the cooler we received  had a crack in the tank so it wasn’t able to be used. Called the customer service and after a few emails and pictures of the damage they sent us and entire new unit! I was expecting just a new tank so it was an awesome surprise that they were able to fully fix our issue. New cooler works great, we put ice packs and ice cubes along with cold water in the tank, which lasts quite a long time. So thankful in this heat.Also we were able to flex seal the broken tank shut and also works like a charm so we have one going in each room. Love love love this cooler, completely worth the price tag.

  Hey brother listen up!Okay so here it. Your H0melabs evaporative cooler. I know you’ve been looking at all the other “portable swamp cooler” scenarios for a little under 300 or 400 bucks like I had. Well let me shed some truth on your question mark train of thought my brother!This medium size swamp cooler. Is.... decent..Now let me shed some light on that D word (aye)If your planning on having this device cool down your whole room, it will. If your planning on having this device cool down your whole house, naw. Unless you live in a beautiful rundown vintage trailer like I do!So let’s get down to that nitty gritty.I live in a Desert. We get up to 109 degrees. This device has legitimately made my days waaay cooler. BUT.... if your expecting this to cool your master bedroom/your kids room/ your side girls room in the garage/ it’s pretty much only good for one room but a large one at that. If you positioned it correctly and had the correct type of house and kept constant ice in it 🧊 well then excuse me! Put this in a corner of a very large room, keep ice in it. That room can be more than 10 degrees cooler. I had an issue with the motor rotating down into the panel where you put ice and water for around a week or two before I figured out you have to be very careful when sliding it out and back in. (Also there is a plastic sticker you have to reach in and remove for it to work properly which I didn’t know about and wasn’t said in directions)Now I know how to do it correctly with my manly strength. So my decent rating is for the effectiveness, which is good. But definitely needed better instructions on how to use it right out of the box. But it really does work well my brother and I would actually recommend this for a large room and a garage 🙂

  It makes a huge difference and the water lasts longer than I expected.  With the full tank, it lasted 10 hours and it had a little left.  My wife did not like that the fan is strong but that is a good thing for me, it helps with me feeling cooler.  You can not substitute the air conditioner but in our case, we are putting it 8 degrees higher than we normally put it and I don't feel any difference at night.  Also from 3 pm to 6 pm (because of our electricity plan), we turn off the air in AZ and I am not dying around 5 pm.

  I am very pleased with this purchased. I have a room that faces the direct sun all afternoon and its the furthest room from  the AC cooler, so it gets cheated. Once its hot, its almost impossible to cool down so I purchased this unit to counteract the heat.  I love that it has a variety of settings and that I can change the speed and direction of the blower. It works as a fan and as an evaporative cooler, and I use the cooler with cold water and ice.  The cool setting takes the room temp down 10 - 13 degrees in a matter of minutes and the ""night setting"" is not perfectly quiet, but easy to accept and slept through.

  Have used the cooler for several days now. In a low humidity region (northern Rockies). Using the cooler to help in the great room of a log home. The unit doesn't put out cold air. It puts out cool air. On really hot days the AC has come close to kicking in, but the cooler may have kept the room temp from going over the edge needed to kick on the AC. In the relatively large room I am using it in it seems to not so much cool the room as keep the temp in the room from increasing as fast as it would otherwise. The unit does increase the humidity in the room somewhat. It's super easy to use. Glad I got it.

Great way to cool down a room
","

  This swamp cooler works perfect. It cameFully assembled, just add water and turn on. It is easy to use and cools my bedroom to a comfortable temperature. I wasn’t sure if the tank would hold enough water to run all night but if I fill it all the way up it does. Still unsure if there is an auto shut off, at least for the pump, if it runs out of water. Only downside it has is it is a bit loud. It’s fine if you run the fan on normal because it’s a constant white noise but the other fan settings (it does irregular fan speeds/turns off completely and then back on) are really unpleasant to listen to. I would recommend this to others.

It cost me $115.30 in shipping to return a DOA product that cost me $180 for the initial purchase.

  I live in coastal South Carolina and bought this evaporative cooler for a room that faces south. Despite the room being connected to our home's central AC system, the room has been practically unusable  due to its having windows on 3 sides that gets sun all day. Winter or summer, if the sun is out, the room is uncomfortably hot. If you are familiar with personal size swamp coolers, this works much the same way, but on a grander scale. Unlike a regular fan that circulates whatever air is already in a room, thiswell-designed unit will blow out really cool to cold air within a sizeable area. My room is 168 sq ft (the specs say it is good for cooling a room up to 200 sq ft), but the cooler does not cool the WHOLE room...but rather makes the AREA of the room where I place the cooler....cool and comfortable. If you have reasonable expectations of the device's capabilities, you will LOVE this product. I love this product. I keep it at a lower setting, as it can be a bit loud... a fair trade off, I think, for the benefits it provides. The machine is attractive, easy to use, with many options for operating. The remote control is an added bonus. It arrived sooner than expected and was VERY well packaged. I hope to have use of it for years! Thank you for this product, especially at such an affordable price.

True Evaporative Cooler - Good for Small Rooms
","

  I've been using this cooler daily now that Texas heat has reached 105 and over some days. My house has basic evaporative cooling so our rooms heat up a lot at night making it uncomfortable to sleep with just a fan. I decided to buy this unit because the price point is affordable and it has a somewhat larger tank so filling it up and using it throughout the night isn't a problem. The capacity for the water tank is fairly large so I was able to fill it to almost the fill line then add ice. I recommend you add ice for best results as the a/c has a fan function as well as a cooling function and the best option is definitely the cooling function.The a/c unit does have a couple of cool features - notably you can pick what ""wind"" style you want which is you can have the fan wax and wane while controlling the motion of the blades like a typical old school fan. I like to leave mine on a fixed setting because it feels best to cool down a room. The a/c is also very easily portable, it's not too heavy and has wheels on it to make taking it to other areas very fast and easy.The biggest plus is the remote - I don't have to get up from my bed to control the unit and I can easily switch between modes effortlessly with the tap of the button - which includes turning off the cooling function, controlling the swing and speed of the fan blades and simply turning my a/c off and on.My two biggest cons and what makes me give this item 4 stars is that 1: the unit isn't quiet - you do get used to it but there is definitely a loudness to it and 2. the size - like most portable a/c units, this one is on the larger size so if you are in a small space, this can definitely take up a lot of room. Right now it does just that so it feels a little bulky.Overall, still happy with item and appreciate that it's helping me beat this summer heatwave.
