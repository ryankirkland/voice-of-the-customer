Didn't work, then worked, now don't work again
","

  All I got in terms of use out of these batteries were about three days of use out of two of them and have had no additional success. I bought them because I was bleeding through AAA batteries and was hoping the compact design would be better than something more bulky.Right out of the box, I charged them until the light was green indicating they were fully charged, tried to use them in a couple of devices and didn't have any luck. I was going to return them, but my friend suggested I switch from charging in an extension cord to directly in a wall socket. I thought that it did the trick, even though I thought that was silly, when I tried the batteries in a device after letting them charge overnight plugged directly into the wall socket, they did work, and worked well.About three days later, the device stopped working in the middle of high powered usage (hair trimmers). I swapped the batteries I had in there for the other two that had been charging the entire time, and they didn't work. I went out and bought regular AAA batteries and the device went back to working just fine. I tried the batteries in a few other devices and they aren't working. It seems they work just enough to convince you they work, then stop working.I don't often leave feedback on products, but I felt it was important to say here that I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. If not totally faulty, they are at the very least completely inconsistent, and you'd do better just buying disposables.

These absolutely suck
","

  I bought these for a wall mounted magnifying mirror that has LED lights so you would think it shouldn't be sucking an immense amount of power out of these. If I turn the mirror on long enough to check my makeup and apply mascara I get about 3 uses out of it at 5-10 minutes a piece before these die and have to be recharged again. Opening the mirror to remove them is a PITA so I'm not pleased.

Poor Quality - Unreliable

  I had high hopes for these batteries because the design is a great concept. However, I was very disappointed when I charged up the batteries and placed them in a flashlight and found that two of the batteries quit working after only a few minutes. Amazon offered to send me a replacement and yet I still have had the same issues with the second batch. I have tried using both sets in several different flashlights and have experienced much worse performance with them compared to generic AAA batteries that I bought at the grocery store. I have seen someone else write about a similar experience which leads me to believe that this is a common problem.

  I love the idea of rechargable and this was one of the few lithium ion ones that are rechargable individually by USB.  It was hard to compare to normal ni-cad rechargable but these seemed more environmentally friendly.  The form factor and convenience are real. The biggest disappointment is the length of time they last.  I use a generic Bluetooth mouse.  Previously I used non-rechargeable Amazon basic batteries. They lasted about 2-3 weeks being used about 9 hrs a day for work.  These batteries last about 2 days for the same use.  The other difference is the normal batteries would slowly die and the mouse cursor would slow down or glitch.  These die instantly. I guess that's the lithium ion experience.  I.e. like your cell phone.  Not sure I would buy these again for something that is more critical for power or harder to change the batteries.  I can't compare to other lithium ion.

  I ordered with high hopes, and first set came with one battery that didn't hold a charge.  The others that did charged rather quickly (about 2 hours) and I used a set in my Xbox One controller.  It lasted about that same time as regular batteries, which is awesome.  Had to send those back, as a replacement was sent to me because of the one defective battery.  I kept the two that I knew worked well, and took two others as a replacement and sent the old ones back. The two original are still working fine (on second charge and still lasting just as long), but I received yet another dud.  This time, the battery seems to charge (I receive a green light indicating full charge), but it conks out after a few minutes. So, at this time, it seems the batteries are unreliable, which is a shame, because when they work, they seem to work really well.  But at this time, it seems to be a gamble whether you get 4 good batteries, or just a couple and a couple of duds. As it is now, I have to send all 4 back for a refund (they won't replace them this time).  I really want to like these batteries.  There are other AA USB charging batteries out there, maybe I'll have better luck with them.

  These are novel and strange batteries. It's super convenient to recharge via USB chargers (which are ubiquitous these days). It'd be nice if they came with a 4-way cable to permit charging all cells off one suitable USB charger. These are excellent when you have a device that's really meant for cells like alkaline or lithium primary cells that put out a full 1.5V. Sometimes such a device won't work as well from 1.2V rechargables like NiMH or NiCad. These cells will work better, but you'll need to be aware of key downsides:1) Because they output a full 1.5V steadily until fully discharged, there's no voltage dip for electronic gadgets to use to gauge battery charge remaining. So your device will appear fully-charged on these batteries 100% till cutout, which will be sudden and unexpected. Have a backup set ready!2) Because of (1), these cells are a little risky when used to power devices like digital recorders and cameras. They'll work, but because of the sudden cut-out when discharged, if you fail to stop your recording in the normal way beforehand, you may lose the /entire/ recording due to failure to write-out and close the recording file to the flash memory normally. For a still camera, this'll be just the last picture at cut-out, but for an audio or video recording, you might lose the whole recording. The risk can be minimized by timing the runtime in the device you get from the cells in a test-run first, then being careful to stop using the device in the field in sufficient time to save and close your recording before that time (being sure to adjust for extreme temperatures, which reduce capacity).3) These batteries work by using a micro-mini voltage convertor to step the cell's native 3.6V (4.2V - 3.0V) down to a fixed 1.5V output. A side effect of the convertor's operation is stray radio-frequency emission, some of which is conducted thru into the device being powered. If that device is a radio receiver, like a handheld scanner or FRS/GMRS handy-talkie, or similar, you can expect reduced receive performance.In testing with a handheld scanner I use to monitor operations at my local airport, I experienced a 50% reduction of sensitivity, and some low frequencies (e.g. the AM broadcast band) were lost in the RF noise from these cells entirely. This isn't a defect, it's just a side-effect of how the cells work. A battery-powered GPS device may also be affected, I tried them in a Garmin GPSmap 60CS 2-AA handheld GPS unit. They worked flawlessly for me here, with no reduction in satellite signal strength, but your device may vary and you could try it out first before going into the field. And again, there will be no warning prior to end-of-discharge cut-off, the GPS will appear ""fully charged"" the entire time.So what do I use them for? I have an LED flashlight that's super bright, but was designed for alkaline cells and would not get to full brightness on normal NiMH rechargeables. These cells work _perfectly_ there. The only remaining downside is limited cell capacity. From 2400 mAh NiMH cells, I'd get two hours continuous runtime, but these cells can only provide one hour (1200 mAh capacity). Again, that's simply a side effect of the design and isn't a defect.I also have a couple of fancy electronic flash units for my SLR camera, and these cells work extremely well in that device too!So, know your device and your application to decide if these cells are right for you. Most modern electronic gadgets like radio equipment or digital recording devices will be designed to operate just fine from 1.2V NiMH cells, and these won't harm the receive performance of a radio like these USB cells. Plus, you'll get proper charge-state indications from NiMH cells. Just remember to select and pack a quality NiMH charger in that case.

  The one and ONLY downside I have found with these batteries is that you get no directions, but it is extremely easy to figure out.  They light up when they are charging.  The AA blink until fully charged and then have a solid blue light near the Positive end.  The AAA batteries blink until they are full charged, which at that time the light shuts off.  The shipping was quick and adequate.  I'm using the AAA for my wireless keyboard and mouse.  I'm very glad not to have to buy any more batteries for a long time to come.  The AA batteries I'm fix'n to put into one of my TV remotes.  Can't say enough good things about this product.

  I purchased the AA batteries.  They do not come with instructions.  What is written on amazon is what you get.  They do not have a red light to indicate charging.  Mine flashes blue.  When they are charged they turn to solid blue.  After the second charge I had thought the batteries stopped working.  It turns out the pin in the cap was slightly bent and was not making the correct connection with the bottom part in one of the batteries.  I bent it back to match the other batteries and everything seems fine for the time being.

WORKS GOOD FOR MAGLITE
","

  The 4 pack is awesome, for testing purposes though, I have only been using the same 2 batteries in my mini maglite for almost 2 years (the other 2 are used randomly in the house) and have charged them over 50 times. When using the flashlight a lot I can get two weeks from a charge and have they sat unused for months and still had adequate charge left. The charge doesn't last as long as alkaline but, on the other hand, I haven't bought batteries for my light in two years. It takes about 4 hours to charge from completely dead.  They make the flashlight as bright as a ""fresh out the pack"" pair of alkaline batteries and they stay that bright. They don't dim the flashlight as they discharge like the alkaline do. The flashlight stays at peak brightness until the batteries are fully discharged and the light goes completely out. I keep a pair of alkaline batteries in my toolbox at work for when the light dies and I'm needing to use the light and cant wait for them to charge. When the batteries are done charging they go back in the light and the alkaline go back in the toolbox.

  The fact these even exist in the first place is a godsend. They charge via any USB port in about an 90 minutes and will work in your every day electronics. Is perfect for game controllers that still use AA batteries, TV remotes, wireless mouse and keyboards (which is what I got them for) and many other devices.If there is one thing I will say is a small concern is the cap on top that covers the USB port. It's held on by a small elastic cord to prevent it from being misplaced. I would be very careful when removing and replacing, as it feels it can snap off if moved too fast, so just be careful.Other than that, my only other complaint is........why did I not get these sooner? They are 100% worth the money. I plan to get some more of these and some AAA versions soon.

They do what they claim to do
","

  Been using these for 6 months in my game controllers. I've only had to recharge them once so far.Because of the elastic band holding the cap on, it can be a little finicky to get them properly charging in the USB port, but since they illuminate when charging that's not much of an issue.The biggest downside that you might overlook is that any device you put these into can't know the charge level. So my wireless controllers won't warn me when they're low on battery anymore -- they just go from working well to flaking out when the batteries are low without much warning. Presumably this is because the voltage of these batteries as they discharge doesn't follow that of a typical alkaline battery (instead, the voltage is mostly constant throughout the discharge because of the circuitry that converts the 3.7 V of the lithium battery to the 1.5 V presented at the AA terminals, until it just completely drops out).

  Been using this for my gaming mouse which uses 2 batteries at a time and they usually last about 6-8 weeks before I have to switch them out. That's perfectly acceptable for how much the mouse gets used.  With regular batteries, it would last about 5 to 6 months so you get your money back and then some within the year. I'm sure wit degradation I will have to switch them out more frequently but that has yet to be determined.

  I had purchased a large pack of regular lithium batteries for my Blink cameras and Kwikset Smart Locks, so I would have extras on hand. The batteries last so much longer than standard batteries, so I decided to look into rechargeable lithium batteries.I bought this 4-pack a a test. I like that you just pop the cap off and stick them in a USB to charge. It takes about 90 minutes to fully charge the batteries. The red light is on during charge and off when done. No looking around for the charging equipment either, which is incredibly convenient.I put these batteries into a new Kwikset Smart Lock I had just installed. I replaced the batteries in another Kwikset Smart Lock elsewhere in the house, so I could compare the rechargeable vs standard lithium. The other lock is used much more often and the batteries in it are still going strong after I just had to charge these batteries. Time was about 3.5 months. Considering I could recharge them and replace them at no additional cost, AND that they still lasted 3.5 months in the lock was impressive enough that I plan to buy more.Next, I would like to test them in my Blink cameras to see how they fare. I will update this review once I have done so.

  No need for a battery charger, you can just plug it into your laptop, computer, or wall charger to charge them. They do not have as much capacity as a normal rechargeable battery (which is less than a normal battery) but it is TERRIFIC for wireless mice and other low-draw devices. They also weigh less than normal batteries, meaning that they are great for devices that you would think would be better if they were lighter (again mice/gaming peripherals). I bought these for my Logitech G604 and have only switched out the battery once in 6 months of never turning off the mouse or switching it over to Bluetooth, i.e. worst-case scenario for the mouse.

  I purchased this item and the associated charger because I am burning through batteries with my gen 1 Blink Camera devices and thought a rechargeable was the way to go. However, I have noticed, and since reached out to Blink, that I have lost functionality for the cameras. (I am told it is because these rechargeables are not recognized, nor is there any plan moving forward to support rechargeables:(My motion sensor is all but useless, the live feed is slow to load and takes multiple attempts, and then it continues to fail to register that a fresh set of charged batteries are in the device.While this is not a direct reflection on the batteries themselves, it was an investment to purchase both the batteries and charger that I am now left to find other uses for since that are contraindicated for the original intended devices.

  We go  through batteries like crazy around our house.  Although we've had a several times tried re-chargeable. they just need recharging to often.  So we usually resort to AA and AAA lithium batteries from the major brands.  When I saw these advertised I thought how clever, a AA rechargeable Li-ion battery with a USB plug at one end for charging!  They actual charge well, although a little slowly(probably a built-in safety feature).  They also don't have the high capacity that I was used to  back in the NiMH days.  They are only rated at 1200mAh.

  Been using them for a few weeks now and they work great charge fast and last pretty long mainly been using in my Xbox controller only reason there 4 instead of 5 is because there is no low battery warning it just dies abruptly without warning so not good for competitive play but for normal functionality would not be a problem definitely saved me money in buying batteries

  Use these batteries in my Keypad for my alarm system.  Regular batteries last about 2 days on average.  The only drawback is you have to take the time to recharge.

The blue light will inform you when the battery is fully charged and ready for use.  Great value for the money as of this review.

As fragile as an egg shell
","

  I purchased a couple sets of these as an alternative to purpose-built rechargeable battery packs for Xbox One controllers. While I was initially pleased with the purchase, that pleasure unraveled in short order.The Good:The little rechargeable batteries feature a nifty ""flip cap"" design, exposing a standard-issue USB-A male connector (think: the tried and true USB connection type for desktop computers and wall chargers). They charge relatively quickly, and fit perfectly well in anything that accepts AA batteries.The Bad:TL;DR: they break. Very. Easily. The USB connector (not the battery top-style cap) breaks with very little provocation. On top of that, the actual innards of the lithium battery also come out of the metallic ""battery"" housing without much effort as well (say, when removing the battery from the port in which it's charging). Out of eight batteries (two 4-packs), only about three remain intact at the time of this review. While I admittedly did not got out of my way to be extra gentle (and, to be fair, I didn't see the need to be), I also did not physically punish these items to the extent that their current condition would suggest. I've handled plenty of similar-sized USB devices from thumb drives, to Bluetooth/WiFi and more, and have not experienced this level of degradation before.Conclusion:I believe this product to be a case of good idea/poor implementation. The convenience of having AA shaped/sized rechargeable batteries which do not require a specialized charger is delightful, but the elation there only lasts as long as these batteries (read: not long at all). I have since broken down and purchased charging stands with battery packs for my controllers, and that seems to be working out a good deal better. I wanted to like these little guys (and actually did, in the beginning), but I can't allow myself to love a product with throwaway build quality. Buyer beware.

  Absolutely love these. The time to a full charge is a little bit longer than what it says on the site...(I'm seeing approximately 2 hours from a near dead charge to full but that's fine.  I use these for in wireless IEM's and they work great.  The ONLY drawback, (that I admit I have not experienced yet but I anticipate a failure) is the stretchy string that holds the cap on -  i see it failing, and i also see really no way to replace it, which means at some point I will likely lose the cap rendering this useless.  Nevertheless, 1500 charges before failure, I figure I will save close to $1200 over the life of the batteries.

  These are a fantastic idea. I love them however I wish they lasted a little longer. I bought them to go in a battery operated under the cabinet light strip.

I do like that they are super easy to recharge and I like that the caps stay attached by an elastic cord when charging. I will just have to find another use for them.Edit: after having these for a while I dont even really use them anymore. They would be good for a low power device maybe.

  I purchased these for my Oculus Quest controllers, and at this point, I'm convinced they should just be purchased for anything. Unlike most rechargeable batteries, these give off a full 1.5v (instead of 1.2v which many other rechargeables do) and the fact I do not need another charger (it's built into the battery) just make these the best rechargeables I've owned so far. As far as battery life goes, they surpass the Quest's own battery life even after heavy Beat Saber sessions (and yes, putting sabers into the fields so the drain is even harder).They may be pricy at $20 for 4, but if you hate swapping batteries and keep losing the chargers, pair these up with a USB multi-charger and you have a match made in heaven. Also, the battery case included is pretty nice as well and most hotels I've seen now have USB chargers in the room, so what isn't to love about these things?

  These are so far very good indeed. We are using them for Sennheiser EW100 wireless body pack microphones, which are medium to high-drain devices, and have done so for a few months now. They easily last for 6 hours on a charge. Indeed, after 6 hours of use, the battery indicators on the transmitters still show *full.*  They are already saving us on disposable AA alkaline cells.These don't fit in adjacent ports in a typical USB charger, but that's a charger problem. We can always get little USB Male to Female pigtails, but I just use additional chargers. Problem solved.Also, I plugged just two them into my desktop computer to charge, and they took away power from other connected USB devices. So you might need to use a dedicated charger, or perhaps only charge one at a time with your computer.From reading some of the reviews, I'm thinking that these might not be good for low-drain / low-use applications such as digital clocks, remote controls or doorbells. So your mileage may vary.

Less waste than regular batteries (and yeah we all know we aren't supposed to throw batteries away with our regular trash, yeah? But who actually knows where to take them? And who is actually disposing of them properly?)2. Safer. No chance of leaky, corrosive chemicals.3. Cheaper. Yes the up front cost is more, but they pay for themselves.4. Long lasting life. I have them in my toothbrush, something I use 2x every day at least, and these batteries last 1.5-2 months.5. Quick charge. They take maybe an hour to fully charge!6. Convenience. Even if you have self-centered interests, these are still for you. You don't have to remember to buy more batteries. Like ever. Never again.All in all, these batteries are must-haves and worth the initial investment.

  I use mine in Blink cameras.  So far I have had a pair in a camera for the past 6 months and they are still going strong.  This camera goes through a pair of regular lithium batters every 10 months.  I will definitely be purchasing more.

","

  These are solid lithium batteries that work as expected for high demand devices.The only real downside is the removable end caps elastic connectors feel rather flimsy, and I have doubts how long they'll last before breaking. (Hence the 3 star rating.)They're good, but honestly I'd say you're better off going with different models with micro charging ports rather than removable top caps.

  I was expecting a longer lasting battery. These last about 1/2 to 3/4 as long as a basic cheap AA battery. They last about 2-3 hours in a XBox one controller. One battery hasn't charged properly after the initial charge, but the other 3 seem fine. I now use these in a AA mini Maglite and they do fine for that purpose, but for heavy use I would stay with non-rechargeable lithium-ion or standard alkaline batteries. If being rechargeable is a requirement stick with a quality Ni-MH battery.

  Using in my Blink XT and 2Xt cams.

Works good so far but I'm worried about losing the caps on the AA batteries.
","

  On the AAA batteries you plug a supplied micro USB into the side but on the AA batteries you have to take off a cap to reveal the USB charging connector. The cap is attached to the battery by a flimsy thin bungee chord that may not stay attached very long because of the wear-and-tear on the chord every time the battery is charged. The cap is also the positive (+) battery connector so if the chord breaks you'll probably lose the cap soon thereafter and then the battery won't work in any device. And yes, you HAVE to take the caps off to charge the batteries via USB even if the device you're using them in can charge rechargeable batteries.

","

  Right approach for 1.5v uses, however after 1 year and 4 recharges one battery is completely dead-20 millivolts. Other 3 are still 1.5v.  However it’s hard to estimate life when one is going bad.  The first use lasted long as I expected. The next two 1 month, then 2 weeks... I have contacted seller so an update on their review depends on their response.  I would not repurchase 3 for the price I paid and need to re-evaluate their performance... meaning longevity in milliamp hours.  Upon reflection, not incorporating micro usb they could probably increase capacity by 1/3 using that space with battery... but it does make recharging easy if you have a 1200 milliamp hour battery need.

  I use these in my oculus touch controllers and they last quite a few hours I use it daily and about once a week i have to recharge them.  There is no indication that they are getting low though they just either work or are instantly dead so its good to have the 2 not being used all charged and ready.  This is way better than buying regular batteries over and over.

  These are very convenient to use because you can charge them at any USB port...on your laptop, in your car, or any phone charger. Plus their output voltage is a full 1.5 vol5s, where most NiCad or NiMH batteries output only 1.2 volts. Doesn't make much difference for flashlights or motor driven devices, but some elecronic devices may  have reduced.performance at the lower voltage.Only drawback is their capacity, due to shorter length necessary to accommodate the USB charging cap.  At 1200 mAh, they have less than half the capacity of NiMH rechargeable batteries, which are available up to 2850 mAh.

  I purchased these to use with my wireless keyboard and mouse. I think it's a great idea to use these for items you don't tend to use often. Regular batteries have a tendency to explode slightly if left in for too long. Using rechargeable lithium-ion batteries saves time and money, and they fit just as well as a regular AA battery. Will definitely buy again.

Bad design!!!
","

  I wanted lithium ion for the constant 1.5 volts. I use AA batteries in a wireless microphone and a wireless personal ear monitor in the worship band at my church. We do two services, so I wanted these to last through that. I charged them and took them to church, installed them, and... nothing. The devices wouldn't power on. I brought them home, recharged them, put them in a TV remote, then again, nothing. I studied the design, and seeing that the top came off for charging, I assumed that they were charged, just not making good contact. I tried again, this time putting the batteries in the device with the contact point (hinged side) of the batteries down, so as to keep pressure directly on the contact point. This time they worked. BAD DESIGN! I gave them a rating of 3, because I guess they work, however because you have to put the in a certain way, that is not very practical nor efficient. I can't speak as to the battery life or durability as of yet.

  I've had these batteries for about a week. After charging them I put them into my mouse and keyboard, and haven't had to charge them since. I like how the batteries have a built in usb to plug them directly into my pc for charging. Other usb rechargables that I've tried have a micro usb port that has to be connected to a cord in order to charge them. So far the only thing I don't like is that the positive cap that covers the usb is connected with a tiny piece of elastic and with probably break easily. When buying these you have to know a couple of things. First these batteries are 1200mah and most nonrechargables are 1500mah batteries. This means that the rechargables won't last quite as long as nonrechargables before needing to be recharged. Also These batteries are lithium ion batteries, and will not function well in extreme cold! In my opinion these rechargable batteries are good to use in remotes, and controllers that stay inside the house.

  These Li batteries took an hour to charge out of the box. My 4-star Battery Life and Durability ratings are provisional, since I've used the batteries less than a week. I use rechargeables in a Braun Pocket Mobile electric razor, whose running speed is limited by the battery voltage. NiMH run at 1.2 volts. The Sorbo box indicates an output rating of 1.5V, plus or minus .2V, or 1.3 to 1.7 V. The razor performance is noticeably better so far. I'm guessing I'll get ten days to two weeks out of a charge. Although the Braun is light, because it's intended to run on batteries and there's no charging circuitry, the Sorbo are also noticeably lighter than NiMH batteries, which is another benefit.

The Next Step in Rechargeable Batteries

  While rechargeable batteries are the answer for portable devices, carrying a battery charger means another portable device to haul around.  This is the next step in easy recharging with devices you're already carrying with you: phone charger, lap top, cigarette lighter USB power plug.  While the endurance isn't the greatest, the convenient recharging balances that out.  When these guys come up with a 2300 mAH version, they'll rule the world.

  I am using these to power temperature reporting transmitters in my two freezers.  Due to the low temp, batteries tend to lose power quickly and the only sensible thing to do is to buy rechargeable batteries.  So far, so good.  But it will be a while before I can say whether these will work particularly well.  So far the answer is yes, but the system I am using is not particularly reliable when compared to an actual thermometer.  As long as the upper limit alarm works, I'll be happy.

Great form but lacking in function.
","

  Wanting to give these batteries a chance to prove themselves, I delayed writing this review. I love the idea of popping the top and charging the batteries right from a USB port. In this respect, I am quite happy with the product. I can't yet speak about the longevity of the product, having owned them for only a few months and recharging them barely a handful of cycles. What I can say is that they don't have much of a charge and they don't hold a charge well at all.I bought these to power my son's Kodak Pixpro FZ43. Now I must qualify my review by admitting that I don't know anything about batteries or the power consumption of the camera. I am primarily interested in usability. Having said that I can only attest that the batteries last for about 40 photos before the camera shuts down after claiming the batteries are low. These are photos taken outside during daylight hours with no flash, with the camera remaining on between snaps and also using functions like the grid and telephoto. In other words, neither my son or myself were very much impressed.Another criticism is that the charged batteries have a very short shelf life. I charged all four batteries after my son's last picture taking session and we didn't need them again for about three weeks. When we attempted to use the batteries in the camera again we removed two of them from the protective case they came in and installed them in the camera. The camera wouldn't even begin to power up, indicating the batteries were completely dead. Of course, I checked to make sure the batteries were installed correctly and they were. I tried the second set of two batteries with the same results. After an hour and a half of charging time the batteries powered up the camera and were again good for around 40 shots or so.I can't recommend this brand of batteries. Hopefully, my experience is not typical and others are having better luck with them. I still like the idea and will try again with another brand in the near future.

  These batteries are really easy to recharge and use.  They seem to work fine in any device.  There is only one draw back.  The total power that they can provide is similar to conventional batteries.  This might be expected, since so much volume is used for the USB port being built in (instead of being dedicated to more battery).These are perfect for a device is that not too power hungry and that you don't want to be wasteful buying batteries for all the time (like a wall clock, or LED candle).As the need arises, I will buy more of these again!

  One disadvantage you may want to consider is that the battery generates some rf noise.  I had to take it out of my ccrane radio because I could not receive weaker stations anymore.

Good, but not up to par with traditional lithium batteries

  These batteries are very easy and fairly quick to charge using any USB output device, such as a laptop/PC or other device charger.I have been using them for the better part of a year as an alternative to the Energizer Ultimate Lithiums, with no noticeable drop-off in capacity. They also fit the same as any AA battery.While these are serviceable, note that you will get neither the output nor the duration to match traditional lithium batteries.  I use these to power a wildlife/license plate camera, and so have had the rechargeables in constant rotation running 24x7. Where the Energizers will last for over two weeks (about 17 days depending on traffic) these batteries need to be replaced every 8-10 days.  The device also complains that they do not output the same power as a Lithium battery, but it does run fine, including infrared and flash.Saving a lot of money on batteries, so I’m happy with the purchase, but when I need to leave town for more than a week I put in the Energizers.

  It's hard to give a through review of these batteries without having run them through multiple charge/discharge cycles.That said they seem to work as advertised, they hold a charge for an amount of time that is comparable to disposaby batteries, they recharge easily and you never have to carry a specialized charging dock.I also bought a similar model of battery that recharges through a micro USB slot on the batteries side; the capacity of that version may be a little better (no on board charging circuit to take up space) but I prefer the convenience of this model.The reaction you get from people the first time they see you take off the end of the battery to reveal the USB charger never gets old; worth it for that alone. I'd be surprised not to see this design become the standard for AA batteries over the next few years.

Sometimes 9, 11, 12 but never longer than 14 days which is a complete failure to me!No wonder they sell them in 4 packs because you will be needing to recharge and rotate so often you must have a backup pair for access to your computer.Hopefully they will last longer than a few months of constant recharging but if I'm recharging them every 2 weeks they'll probably burn out in a relatively short period of time.

","

  I got these because I didn't like the idea of wasting AA batteries anymore. I figured technology had gotten to the point where I should be able to recharge a battery that works similar to AA batteries. Now, the price is something I debated with myself over. Does the price of the battery justify the purchase? Well, that gets down to how many AA you can buy for the price of these. Furthermore, how long those batteries will last. The average Lithium battery lasts 5-7 years. Some have been known to last longer. Unfortunately, I don't have enough information. But, if you want to reduce the waste, it's about whether or not you feel like the price justifies the outcome.By the way, if you've bought batteries like these before and they were orange, it looks like those have been discontinued for these blue ones instead. The only difference is the orange ones glow green to indicate that they are fully charged. The blue ones don't. They just stop glowing.

These batteries might fool you into thinking they're super, but they're no better than NiMH
","

  These batteries read full charge until they just die all of a sudden, so I was fooled into thinking that they were fully charged but they really were not.  My NiMH batteries on the other hand, read low charge pretty quick, but I always recharged them when they got low.  This time I let them go longer once they got low, and they lasted much longer than I thought they would.  So the NiMH fooled me into thinking they were out when they really were not.The test:  4 of these batteries (new) vs. 4 Panasonic Eneloop NiMH (about 2 years old) in my security camera.  I ignored the battery indicator and just waited until they die.  The lithium died after 12 days.  The NiMH went 11 days and were still working but I think they were about out since I think it was missing some night vision pics (I think the camera misses some night vision pics once it gets low).  And if the NiMH were new they would probably do better.The conclusion:  These don't seem any better than NiMH.  They cost about twice as much.  They claim 1,000 charge cycles, where the NiMH claim 2,100.  I think I'll stick with the NiMH.  I returned the lithium batteries.

  5 stars just for being such a great idea. All 4 AA batteries charged up just fine, I haven't tried them out yet. At 1200 mah, they should have about half the capacity of an alkaline AA. Will update review once I've used them a bit. If they charge even 10 times they'll have ""broken even"" compared to 50¢ for an alkaline and anything beyond that is just a bonus.

They don’t last! Don’t waste your money.
","

  After reading some of the reviews I decided to give these a try. What a waste of money...  I bought these to use in an outdoor thermometer transmitter. Regular alkaline batteries were lasting a month during cold weather and about 1.5-2 months during warmer weather. Charged these up and replaced the alkaline batteries. Only to swap them out less than 2 weeks later!  I’ve swapped them twice now in less than a month. They work, which is why I gave at least one star. They don’t last at all, definitely way less than an alkaline, which is why only one star. Unless you are going to put them in something like a Wii remote that can be charged between uses, don’t even bother.

Love these USB batteries
","

  Batteries always needed, even better if rechargeable. I like the fact that you can charge it almost anywhere a usb is available. I have a similar battery and it has served me well over a year and still going strong, so I am giving these a chance to see how these perform. I received mine in orange instead of blue and received a quick e-mail to explain the difference. A big thumbs up to the retailer. (Apparently orange has a red led when charging and green when complete. The blue battery indicates red when charging and turns off when charged).  1.5 volts as indicated compared to 1.2 volts of other rechargeables is the selling point for me. I’ve had low performance with 1.2 volts in the past. The downside for me is the small elastic band that attaches the cap to the body of the battery. Not a deal breaker but I wish it was magnetic like the other brand I have. Overall I like it.

I thought I'd spend a fortune on batteries then I came across these babies. The have been great!!! Super easy to charge, I bought 3 packs - so, 12 total.

  Bought the four pack with the blue batteries. They don't seem to have the same green finished charging light as the 2 pack orange ones. There is a red light for charging but then it just goes out after a bit. I am unsure if it doesn't have the green light or if there is actually a malfunction and they are not charging fully. I tried charging all four batteries. Used them in my travel beard trimmer after and it worked great with maybe a fraction slower speed than a standard AA. (unscientifically tested by the different sound frequency i heard) It cut just as good. All in all I just don't know if they were built without the charged light or if they are defective. Its that lack of peace of mind that gave it 3 stars. maybe someone else with the four pack could weigh in if they're having the same issueUPDATE: The company emailed me and it turns out they switched all batteries to blue now and they no longer have the green charge light. It's nice to know they are working properly. When compared to a standard AA in my beard trimmer they still seem slightly less powerful but only just.

Really long battery life, a little annoying to charge.
","

  I've tested out many different AA batteries (lithium and NIMH) and I have to say that these lithium batteries are really delivering on capacity and weight compared to the NiMH counterparts.After using these in a wireless controller; I was able to MORE THAN DOUBLE the battery life of other rechargables that I have used in the past.Admittedly those are not the highest capacity rechargables but still its MORE THAN DOUBLE the battery life.These things are a pain in the neck to charge though as they use a USB cable to charge each one. While this means you don't ""need a charger"" you also can't charge all 4 unless you have one of those multi-port charging stations... and even then you will have to eat up the entire station just to charge these...I cannot really fault them otherwise though; as the capacity is so good and the weight is also lower. If you want to invest in lithium batteries; these ones or the other ones from the same brand that don't have these built in chargers are a good option.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!

  These are priced a little higher than some rechargeable AA's, but the convenience and performance are worth it.The magnetic charging cables work like a charm.  Simply plug the USB cable into your charger or USB port, then bring the magnetic lead over the top cap of the battery and it will snap itself into place.  It's a quick charge, fully charging your battery in under 2 hours.My capacity tests resulted within 10% of the rated capacity (2000mAh), which was pretty good considering they were running a circuit with a buck converter eating up some of the efficiency.The size is very accurate, being only slightly longer (within about 0.2mm) than a standard alkaline battery, and nearly identical in diameter.My only complaint is that the instructions printed on the box were nearly impossible to read, due to both the size of the font and due to the color of the text not contrasting well with the background color.  However, I also noticed an error in the text on the box, claiming the leads would light red while charging and green when complete.  In fact, the leads light blue while charging.  I would refer to the instructions here on the product page for more accurate information and to spare straining your eyes trying to read the box.I'm very happy with these and would highly recommend them for anyone in need of rechargeable AA's.

nice batteries; charge cables are inefficient
","

  I’ve used lots of rechargeable batteries over the years, including NiCad and NiMH batteries.  But I’ve started shifting to rechargeable lithium batteries because they hold a charge a lot longer than other rechargeable types can, especially when not in use for a long time.  They also tend not to develop a “memory” when charged frequently.This particular AA rechargeable battery set includes four AA lithium batteries, a plastic battery storage case, and two magnetic charge cables.  This set does not come with an AC-USB adapter.The magnetic charge cables are pretty interesting, although somewhat limited in utility.  Each cable has two heads, and each one magnetically attaches to the positive end of a battery and charges by USB.  The downside is it can only charge two batteries at a time, so you have to use both cables and tie up two separate USB ports to charge the four batteries.  The cables are also very short, so this method of charging is only useful if you’re charging them very close to a computer or USB charging hub.  This is not very efficient at all, although it may be a good solution for someone who travels and doesn’t want to lug around a typical box charger.  While charging, each magnetic head gives off a blue light that turns green when charging is complete.  It took several hours to fully charge the batteries.  Once charged, though, they work great in any device using AA batteries.Overall, this is a nice set of rechargeable batteries.  It’s an expensive set, but when you consider the cost of AA alkaline batteries these days, it should save a lot of money down the road, especially when used in battery hogs like toys, flashlights, and camera flash attachments.

Move aside NiMH, Lithium is here.
","

  While these batteries may seem a tad pricey, if you think about how many alkalines they will be replacing, it's a great value. The best part of these batteries is that they maintain their 1.5V throughout their charge rather than the lower 1.2V of a standard NiMH. This really makes a difference in situations where the voltage tolerances are a bit tighter. For example, when playing my LCD modded GameBoy Color, 1.2V batteries would sometimes flake out when loading games from a flash cart because of the power draw. I didn't have that issue at all with these batteries because they maintained their 1.5V throughout. The charging cables snap easily to the tops of the batteries and the light indicators tell you when it's charging and when it's done. As my budget allows, I will be picking more of these up in the future.

I did put them in a flash light and turned it on for a solid hour and the light never lost any brightness to it. I would have left it on longer to test the longevity of the batteries  but the flashlight was really hot so I wonted to cut it off. Pretty positive the heat was from the tiny flash light not the battery. I really like these and I’m going to be purchasing some just like this for AAA batteries as well. I would highly recommend

  I wanted to see how this new style charging system works.Pros:- Simple to attach- Quick Charge time- 2 sets of charging cordsCons:- Takes an outlet or port for each pair of batteries- No Outlet AdaptersSo I received this item and immediately unboxed them to see how this works.What you get:4x AA Rechargeable 1.5v 2000 mAh batteries2x USB-A (3.0) cablesThese batteries can connect to an outlet or a laptop or hub.  Of course, if you want to attach them to an outlet, you will have to provide your own USB-A adapters for the cords.  The cords have a USB-A(3.0) end and the other end has two magnetic adapters that connect to top of positive (+) side of the batteries.  Once connected the magnetic adapter turns blue for charging and green when charging is complete.  The box stated that the batteries are Li-ion batteries.  However .. nothing on the batteries themselves says they are Lithium.  The batteries also have not code on them so you cannot tell by the CR number either.  The battery is slightly different from a standard AA rechargeablebattery.  The top has a circular opening in the middle and you can see a small circuit board inside the top of the battery.  It appears to be open and not windowed so I would recommend NOT getting these wet.The batteries charged fully in just under an hour and a half and so far have worked just as well as my current set of rechargeable batteries.  I will update this review if the longevity does not pass muster but so far they are performing well and I really like the easy magnetic connect and disconnect of the battery system.

Rechargeable battery industry changing for the better...

  I really like the magnetic charging cables. But you might be wondering if they'll charge other rechargeable AA batteries, sadly the answer is no. The positive end of this battery is specifically sized to fit the magnetic connectors. But they'll probably be compatible with other batteries that were made for these types of usb magnetic connectors because I'm sure many will be universal.I think USB rechargeable batteries will be game changers. It's not as if I've never had rechargeable batteries, I think we all have. But do we ever use them enough? It seems I'm never prepared with a fully charged set. I probably don't even remember where the charging case and power adapter is. So it's always quicker to grab the regular alkaline batteries, instead of looking for the charger, and then wait for the batteries to recharge. I'm hoping these USB batteries will change my habits because of the convenience of charging them where we spend a lot of our time, at the computer table. Also, nowadays we have usb charging ports all over the house. So we'll see...

These hi-capacity, rechargeable lithium’s seem to be a bit wider than the standard copper tops and were hard to get into the remote!  I was afraid they weren’t going to work.

They came mostly charged, or at least enough to power my little necklace fan that requires two AA batteries. It was a little bit of a challenge attaching them to their charging cords and plugging them in without them disconnecting themselves. I would recommend first plugging the cords in, then attaching the batteries one at a time. Each charging cord has a light where it attaches to the batteries, blue while they’re charging and green once they’re charged. For some reason one battery’s light took several hours longer than the others to turn green, but they are all charged now. I love having small, portable USB charging cords instead of a big, bulky charger that you have to plug into the wall.

  These batteries are great.  Ever since I replaced all of my NiMh batteries with pre-charged like Eneloops and Duracells, I haven't seen any batteries that caught my attention until this.  I love the pre-charged batteries, they have a very long shelf life.  The only problem is it is only capable of delivering 1.2V.  Some appliances and toys don't run as effective using 1.2V LSD batteries.  Particularly those with motors, they may run but can be slow and dragging.  These rechargeable Lithium batteries solved that problem.This comes with 2 pairs of chargers.  The only thing I noticed is that it heats up the batteries during charging.  Luckily, I have a 4-position charger for these batteries and I am just gonna use these cords for​ emergencies.The only other gripe, for now, is the initial cost.  Maybe when there's already a lot of manufacturers then the price will stabilize.

We go through a lot of AA batteries in our various electronics, so looking into rechargeable batteries only makes sense.The batteries come with the charging cables that are magnetically held on and work well in everything we tried them in. They last a long time when not in use and seem to hold the charge well.Highly Recommended!CFH

  The size of the batteries are a little bit wider than regular batteries, so I have to squeeze it to the place.Pro is strong and unique design. Once it’s charged, it lasts really long and powerful. The toys I used it can run longer.Con: I wish the charger can charge other rechargeable batteries. It’s not compatible with others. The tip where is used to connect the positive side to charge doesn’t fit my other rechargeable batteries.I gave three star because the size and non-compatibility.

AA Lithium technology, a full 1.5 volts, super simple charging design, and lots of recharge cycles.
","

   This four-pack of 2000 mAh rechargeable lithium AA batteries are a great option if you go through alkaline batteries like I do.  This is my first experience with this form factor of lithium battery.  The brand name AA/AAA rechargeables that I have used in the past were very disappointing.  They were nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) and nickel-cadmium (NiCAD) batteries.  These types of batteries are heavy, they do not hold a charge over time, they have a very limited number of recharge cycles, they can hold a memory (you lose capacity), and typically their voltage is not greater than 1.2 volts.  This is bad for devices that require the full 1.5 volts that an alkaline battery provides.I am hoping these AA lithium batteries hold up because they are a great solution for me. I tend to go through a lot of AA/AAA batteries, especially in my TV remotes, wireless computer mouse, and so many other devices that use AA batteries.  This purchase was an expensive first investment, however, over time, I expect them to pay for themselves.  I have spent a lot more on regular alkaline batteries from Costco (and those NiMH/NiCAd batteries) so I am excited about how these will perform.These batteries look to be built very solidly.  I am glad they have circuit protection for low-voltage and overcharge-protection, as well as some other safety features. Charging these could not be easier with the included magnetic wires, however, it looks like you can charge these with a 5 volt  AA size wall charger (not included).With the one-year warranty, I feel confident about giving these a try and not worried about wasting my money. So far I am more than happy.

  They're okay, and it's a nice idea, but after fully charging, these don't hold the charge for long. If you don't use the device on a regular basis and recharge when needed, you'll find the batteries drained when you need them. Recommended for devices that are used frequently. If you put them in a flashlight that's tossed in a drawer or stored in the glove box, you'll be disappointed when you need it.

FUVALY, What a cool way to build a battery
","

  I use Puck lights with a light sensor and a motion sensor so that my family can walk into a room in the dark and a light will come on and stay on as long as it sees motion. These are neat devices, and they all require 3 AAA batteries.I have purchased 3 sets of the Fuvaly Lithium AAA batteries along with a clever USB changer.Since I have 4 puck lights requiring 3 batteries each, I now have complete coverage and I can simply pop the batteries out, plug them into the USB charger, and then plug it into the wall outlet near that puck light site.  In about 1/2 hour, the red charging lights turn green, and I simply put the batteries back.No more fiddling with a charger stuffed in an upper cupboard.Update:: I got the AA versions of the battery, and am not as impressed.  I had batteries require more than one charge cycle before failing in a mouse application.  They all glowed green but quickly discharged.  I finally have one that worked in a mouse, so we will see how the rest perform long term.

The batteries of the future !
","

  Do yourself a favor and save some money, along with saving the environment, and get those !Between my Oculus and X-box controllers, I was using a LOT of batteries and in same time money. I found a video of those on YouTube and decided to test them. Best decision ever.The batteries arrived holding already a steady 1.5v charge (even before charging them). I had rechargeable batteries before, that you have to put in their special charger compartment, and took like the whole day to charge. But those one charges from empty to full in a couple of hour max !Love the charging light status on top of the batteries (red = charging and green = charged) and the convenience of the MicroUSB charging system, with the little top you can twist to open or close the charging port. Only down side of this system is that you have to be careful to be sure you're inserting the MicroUSB cable the right way into the battery cell,  and never force it in if it does not fit, or you will damage the charging port, like I saw some people reporting on some review. The use of a USB-C charging port instead will have been better in my opinion to avoid that issue.But non the less, those are great and I even have the feeling they last longer than my regular batteries.

  This set comes with an USB charger that separates into two wires so you can charge both batteries at the same time from one port. It's a nice flat tape like one, instead of the typical round cord. I was pleasantly surprised by that. So I start charging my batteries and probably somewhere around 3 hours later one of the batteries green light finally turns on and I disconnect it although the other is still red/charging. I put it in the flashlight I wanted to use it in but it didn't work... I actually thought the flashlight was broken at first. When the other battery was fully charged I tried that in the flashlight and it did work, so I learned you can't reliably go by the green recharged light. I put the first one back on the charger and it's working fine. This can be a little annoying when you expect the indicator light to be accurate, but that's my only complaint and is easily taken care of by charging longer.

  Amazing! 9-volt batteries are pretty expensive as a general rule, so I was happy to find these on Amazon.  I have a couple of things (other than smoke detectors).  I have a microphone and transmitter that both work off of 9v batteries, and I never know when I will be required to use these items.  I've got the batteries charged and ready to go all the time, just in case.  These are great...I love how you can cover the charging port with a switch.  They hold the charge for a long time, I have them charged up and they haven't run out yet.  They are also lighter than the standard 9-volt battery.  Plusses on all sides!

  Charged up as fast as other brands of this type of rechargeable batteries.  Lasted 2 hour or so longer than other brands in a test of continuous discharge in Ultrafire LED flashlights.  Cost was reasonable and in the middle of the range of other brands I have purchased.They seem to auto shut down their output around 1.5v, and allowed me a few minutes more if the batteries were rested for a minute or two.  This was ok for me since in normal usage of these flashlights will periodic.  So, recharge cycles will be farther stretched out over weeks, maybe months.  And I hate the recycle management of alkaline batteries.I highly recommend this brand.

I use these in my blink cams.
","

  I bought these because the price of lithium AA batteries is quite expensive and these are supposed to be rechargeable lithium AA replacements. They do work but they don’t have nearly the longevity one would expect. The thing about blink camera battery life is that they say it gives you two years on a set of batteries but realistically you’re lucky to get 2 to 7 days. Now I’ve had that limitation on longevity with the regular batteries and I have it even more so with these. There’s another site that are black and green that are also lithium AA that have a better life span as far as longevity goes. All that taken into consideration it’s still a good thing to have because otherwise you’re buying toss away the same AA batteries at 30+ dollars a 24 pack whereas for a similar amount of money you get for batteries that will be able to be used over and over more than six times probably a few hundred times. Even though they may not last as long as the throwaway set and you have to go around to replace them pretty regularly especially if you have your settings to record almost all the motion with a high sensitivity and a long clip blanks it’s still better to have these in my opinion. They do show up as needing to be To be replaced as soon as their inserted into the blink XT cameras and that kind of gives you a looksee into how they’re going to behave because they really don’t last all that long but it’s either that or throw away batteries every three days at the settings I have mine

  I'm using them in a universal remote, a digital weather clock and a trimmer. Time will tell how long they last on a charge, but so far so good. I wanted an alternative to NiMH batteries which are not the correct 1.5 voltage and sometimes get discharged to the point where they can't be recharged again. I like that they don't require a custom charger, just a standard USB cable.The only caveat with this type of battery is they don't work well in portable radios because the built-in voltage regulator puts out wide spectrum radio interference which overloads the radio's sensitive tuner. This shouldn't be a problem for most devices, just radios.

  These rechargeable batteries are amazing. At first, I was worried about the charging system. After using it for a couple of times, I love how it is able to charge with the USB cable.

I wanted to see how long the charge will last so I left it on for 6 hours the first day and then 8 hours the second day. The battery meter on my microphones stayed full both days.

Interesting idea, probably good for some things...
","

  Got these to evaluate for different uses...things that come to mind are my Amazon Fire remote which seems to eat batteries even if I don't use it.First thing -- when you charge them you have to remove the batteries from the device because letting the ends touch (including the series contacts in the devices) will short them out with the charger cable connected.They do charge in about the expected time, and they perform surprisingly well even at very high current draw for AAA cells.  I used an OPUS battery tester-charger in discharge-mode to measure the capacity and the AAA cells came out fairly consistent whether I drained them at 200mA rate or 500mA rate - very impressive maintaining 1.4V right up til the last moment even at the high discharge rate.  I could see this being useful in toys or camera flashes that may go hard on batteries and run out quickly.  Unfortunately the self-discharge (likely because of internal regulator circuitry) makes them less ideal choice for low draw devices like thermometers that could go for years on a normal set of disposable cells.AAA Capacity Measurements: 358mAh, 401mAh, 370mAh, 355mAhAfter sitting on the shelf (in their case) for 4 months, I tested 2 of them again without charging.4-month Capacity Measurements: 355->80mAh, 370->95mAhThis suggests that 2/3 of the capacity was ""drained"" while it was sitting unused, so they would definitely need recharging regularly if you want to let them sit.

Charged when they first arrived, but I plugged them in to get the initial charge as one should do with any new rechargeable battery and let them cool before putting them in my flashlights. Amazing!! Will run them to zero power after the first charge to be safe, but these things are AWESOME! Charging cable has already been used for other usb devices. Def think my single AA 650 lumen light is brighter with these and zero issues (amperage isn’t large enough to cause a problem, these should work in anything using AA’s). Just ordered more.

  I have a $20 Engergizer brand headlamp that takes 3 AAA batteries. I use it a lot and go through many batteries so I bought rechargeable ones. Regular aaa batteries last in this headlamp for several hours before fading. These new Li Ion batteries don't even last one hour before crapping out.

  Just about any 1.5v battery powered device. Great for remotes, mice, etc. Often many devices will quit working once the voltage drops and these don't do that.They at NOT equivalent. Different technology. But they are designed to be plug in replacements and will work as good or better than regular batteries or alkalines.The only exception I can think of is really high current devices with really big motors. Think of devices where alkalines will only last 15 minutes of use. In those cases you should be using a different battery technology anyway.That's the review. Single battery, or 10 batteries in a device. These will work.Background. The reason they work so well is that they have built in protection. Current limiting. Voltage limiting. Voltage and current boosting. And balancing. LiOn batteries actually run at 3.7 volts. Ish. These batteries convert that power to 1.5 volts. When charging they do the opposite only with the correct variable current and voltage the battery needs.And this is the important thing to remember. Because there is a circuit in the middle, there are limits to what it can do. By design. To protect you and the battery from stupid.They don't over charge. They don't let you run them down to where they will break. They just shut off. They also don't let you take more power out (think amps) than they can safely give. It is always bettter to shut down a device or battery then to let you burn your house down.Always.

Maintains 1.5V+ until depleted.
","

  I purchased the 4 pack of the AA lithium USB rechargeable batteries. Normally, when I need rechargeable AAs, I buy Eneloops; however, I have a thermostat that is very sensitive to low voltage. When I use the NiMH rechargeables in the thermostat, the ""replace batteries"" warning begins to flash and the backlight won't work because the voltage per cell is only 1.2 V even though they are fully charged. These lithium rechargeables maintain 1.5V until they are fully depleted and the thermostat no longer has the replace batteries warning. If you have a voltage sensitive device and want to use a rechargeable battery, these are a good solution.  The micro USB port for recharging is handy as well. I cycled all 4 cells and at a 100mA discharge rate, they all delivered a little over the rated 1500 mA/h capacity.  Just remember, with these cells, there will be no fade as they discharge, the device will maintain 1.5V and immediately go out once depleted.

  I have several atomic clocks which are a pita to reset all the functions and get working again after batteries are changed.  These can be recharged without removal, plus the voltage is more consistent at 1.5V.  Just a quick recharge every 6 months or so saves lots of aggravation.  Also thought these, being lithium, might work better than alkaline in the outdoor temp. sensors in cold weather but not so.  Every cool morning the temp. reads dashes so had to switch back.  These appear to be good for warm temps. only.  That's fine, I have use for them inside.

  Had these 4 AA Lithium Ion Rechargeable Batteries with Built in Charger and charging cable for a few days and so far they have worked perfectly,  They charged quickly and the y look like a string of red and green LEDs when they are all attached to the charging cable, which looked cool and clearly indicated their charging state.  Fully Charged, they worked great in a low draw TV remote control.  They are also working great in a Remote Control Car which does not use battery packs; using constantly for over 1/2 hour with no slow down in speed.Also ordered the AAA rechargeable batteries and they worked over 12 hrs constantly on a stick on flashlight.  Recharged quickly, then put them in a remote control car, although the car would not run smoothly when it hit a incline.  It could be the car, but my suspicion is when the motors struggle to turn, they use less power, similar to when a vacuum cleaner speeds up when you block the air flow.  The batteries sense the drop in current and lower the voltage, which causes the car to stop and start, until it is on level ground, then it works normally.

  Fuvaly 1.5v Lithium AA 4x Rechargeable Batteries SummaryPros:* Lights are helpful* Very lightweight* 1.6v unloaded output voltage is great; 1.55v or higher, consistent and based on load* Stays coolCons:* Tested when new to 82.5% of stated capacity (1.857 Wh instead of 2.25 Wh), a little low but in the expected range* Almost no warning when out of power. Cannot be used in critical devices where power cannot be lost.* More expensive than 1.2v NiMHBackgroundMy intended use for these is for wireless Xbox controllers (2 AA) and wireless Oculus touch controllers (1 AA).I have been using high capacity rechargeable NMHi 1.2v AA batteries for a couple years in the XBox controllers. I've tried two models, a 2800mah kind and 2500 mah turnigy brand, marked as low self-discharge.I tested the capacity of these NmHi batteries which were good, however my xbox never showed a full battery, even when freshly recharged, and it would warn for some time that the battery was low. It was good to get the warning and have more use before having to swap them (days of use), but I felt I never got enough life out of these batteries. The 2500 mah Turnigy brand seemed to last longer than the larger capacity ones because they seemed to hold a high voltage. In the oculus it was the same, where some fresh batteries were immediately detected as low.It is true that alkaline batteries start at 1.5v but quickly drop voltage and spend more of their life at 1.3v and 1.2v, and that is why rechargeables match that voltage, but I wanted to try a battery that sustained a higher voltage and see if they provided more ""usable"" power.I chose these Fuvaly because they were the ONLY AA Lithium on amazon who posted details such as discharge rates. I saw these are not a good fit for high discharge rate devices such as camera flashes and some toys like RC vehicles. Having an indicator light and a charge port are superior to batteries where one must remove and replace batteries to reset them and there is no indicator that says what the battery is doing (on or off or charging).Capacity TestI performed a discharge test on standard 4 button charger of a single cell using 0.4a discharge rate, which should last two or three hours. I was happy to see the voltage was a high and consistent based on load for the duration of the test. 1.56v for 0.4a. After it shut off, I let it settle a little and tried to get more out but there was nothing left.I got a total 1.857 Wh of energy out. This is 82.5% of the reported 2.25 Wh capacity. Instead of the reported 1500 mah at 1.5v, I got 1238 mah.This is an expected result due to efficiency loss of the step down conversion, and use of cheap components. I did expect a little better efficiency because the battery must have a 3.7v nominal voltage and output requires only a step down (not a boost converter). Also I did not feel any heat during discharge; that means little loss to heat and it is likely the underlying battery capacity less than 2.25 Wh.I did not test the maximum discharge rate.The good news is the unloaded voltage targets 1.6v, not 1.5v; the voltage dips relative to the load and stays consistent. This means under load the voltage is well above 1.5v. Providing power at a high voltage helps with efficiency.When power runs out on a single cell, the voltage drops to about 1.2v for only 10 seconds or so before completely shutting off. This means electronics get almost no warning when they are out of battery, and the battery and the device will shut off with almost no warning compared to 1.2v NmHi rechargeables. This is compounded when using two or more of these in the same device; the device will be shut off when any one battery is drained. Do not use these batteries in critical devices such as a transmitter for radio controlled aircraft; they will shut off without warning.Charges at 0.36a at 5v, or 1.8 Watts.I did not open the cell but I suspect it is a 1S 600mah Lithium ion polymer battery.  These typically discharge at 5% a month and have a charge shelf life of 300 days.For the best care, do not leave the batteries at a low state; charge them immediately if drained. For slightly longer life, if you are storing them, they are better stored at 35% to 55% capacity or so (50%), not at a full charge. However if you charge them, they will lose 5% a month so it's a good compromise between being ready and storage voltage.Do not charge lithium batteries unattended; use a fire-safe surface such as granite counter top or cement floor; if they become very hot to the touch during charging or discharging, remove them. Recycle them at batteries plus or other store.I will revise my review after more use in devices.Recommendations:* To those who designed and created this: thank you for sharing detailed specifications. Thank you for the lights and physical design and on off behavior.* More capacity would always be welcomed.* These batteries would be perfect if you changed the circuit programming to provide a longer warning voltage time period when the battery is nearly drained. -- Especially under lower loads, there should be 5 or 10 minutes of warning, say at 1.22v. Under moderate loads, there should be a minimum 2 minute warning low voltage. I would prefer this to be longer so that as the battery ages, and gets worse, the warning system would still be ample. This would make the battery more usable as it ages, even as the capacity shrinks.

  The first 4 pack of AAA's I ordered had a single defective battery that refused to hold a charge. (it would go flat within 12 hours of charging even if not put into anything.)However after contacting Amazon and returning the defective product I got a replacement pack in under 48 hours which worked without issue.They're super fast to charge (usually just a little under an hour) and give full power right up until the last moment, making them great for RC vehicles, flashlights, and other devices where full output for the duration of battery life is desired.They're a little pricey, but out perform basic alkaline rechargeables by a huge margin. (About 4x the duration?) So are well worth investing in for a high drain item.

  Did not pay attention at the power rating when I made the purchase.  6000 mAh is more typical for a C battery than a D.  These did not have enough ""juice"" to replace the non-rechargeable batteries I was using.I purchased these because of convenience since they do  not need a separate charger.  However, the tops with the charging ports had a tendency to pop out and I found it difficult to get them back down into the battery.  One of the charging ports got bent when I tried to push them back in which made it impossible to recharge so I returned them.With all the favorable ratings, it looks like others have had better luck than me, but most of those ratings are for the AA batteries.

  This review is for Fuvaly Poly-Lithium AAA 1.5V battery pack (4xAAA). Color of battery is white with blue label.Summary: Mostly positive except 2 minor cons.Con first.1. The AAA battery length is 0.5mm to 1mm too long.It nearly doesn't fit my PIR night light. If you slant the AAA, completely, to slide in, won't do. My way, very snug fit: Slant just enough to compress the negative connector spring. Hold the compression then push down on the positive side. Other method: Thin out the plastic plates on ends of the battery compartment, especially the negative spring connector side.2. You can buy about 64 premium alkaline AAA for its price. That is a lot of alkaline batteries. The good is environmental: less waste: 64xAAA garbage!3. Because of built-in switching regulator circuit, it is electrically noisier than alkaline battery. Try it out on your audio and other devices. It may not have ill effect. The device may have good filter circuit.Pro:1. 1.5V constant until 'empty'!  (99+% of others, Voltage will fall.)It has buck (step-down) switching regulator in it (from 3.6V to 1.5V, regulated).Most alkaline types, 1.5V falls to 1V when in use. So the Watt-hour is much less impressive as claimed in terms of Ampere-hour. Watt-hour= IxVxTime, or IxIxRxTime, where the load is a constant resistor.On some applications, 1.2V is the low limit. If NiCd, NMH are used here, full charge 1.26V will easily reach 1.2V fast.  The claimed Ampere-hour is 60% or more useless. On some modern devices, like MS mouse, the limit is 1V. (I measured it.) It is a better application for NMH battery types. But falling from 1.26V to 1V is still too fast. So, alkaline AAA 'lasts' at least 50% longer than NMH, even if same Ampere-hour rating.2. Include hydra charge cable (1-to-4 micro-USB cable)3. Inside the AAA is also charge-control/protection circuit. Can safely charge with ubiquitous micro-USB 5V cellphone charger.4. Max discharge current limits to 1A by electronic circuit, for longevity of its poly-Lithium battery.

  Just received these batteries, so this is only an initial review. i will do an update in a couple of months.I bought these due to a high rating; came in a 4-pack (my flash takes four); are lithium; came with a charging cable to handle all four batteries at once. My surprise was the plastic container to hold all four. No possibility to short them out by being tossed into the camera bag. Sweet!Plugging the charging cable into the battery is simple. Hold the battery in the left hand with the socket facing the right hand. Take the cable connector, metal shield seam side up, and plug in the connector. Plug the USB into the charger. The top of the battery will turn red. That is all it takes.I will return and update the rating after using them for a few months.

  These batteries are so cool! They work really well and have individual charging outlets on each and every battery. So neat! No need to carry an additional battery charger to charge them.

  ╔ ■ Price Point / Value: 4.5/5╠ ■ Quality: 5/5╠ ■ Recommendation: 5/5╠ ☼ Overall: 5/5╠ ►Product Need:  USB lithium rechargeable batteries╠ ►Product Pros: Easy to charge 2 ways, 1500mAh size, LED indicator, guarantee╠ ►Considerations:  Per unit price, 4 cords╠ ►My Review: This is an item that is why I didn’t I think of that or see it sooner. I love these rechargeable batteries that help fill in the gap of devices that eat batteries constantly. The best part of this is that you don’t need an extra device to charge them while you have the option to do so if you have one. The price per unit is high, but I think is worth it for getting lithium large capacity batteries that just need your existing cord and can be recharged in a hour and a half while outlasting other battery recharge times. If you have any devices that need lithium batteries this is a great deal. If you are charging all four at once, you will need 4 cords which is kind of annoying though. The battery itself has a LED indicator to tell you when it’s ready. I really can’t think of anything I would change to improve this and plan to buy more in the future. If you need lithium batteries or rechargeable ones I would highly recommend these.

  The first set I received was defective as they cannot hold up a full charge. I contact customer service and they sent me a replacement instantly. The replacement works well.There are two way of charging them. One is using the magnetic cable the other is using the charger. A full charge takes about two hours and have same or longer battery life than normal batteries. Also they are more environmental friendly as you have less harmful waste.The cable and charger are designed only for these batteries so if you loose them the batteries are useless unless you purchase extra charger. It will be much better if they can be charged by universal charging cables like USB or type C.

Two Ways to Charge
","

  Recently moved into rechargeable AA batteries for the simple reason that I have so many devices that consume standard AAs and was getting tired of having to dispose of them so often. These rechargeable AAs fit where standard ones will, but I like having the two options for recharging: in a typical hard plastic ""case"" type and the unusual ""octopus"" type, both of which are supplied (and powered by USB, of course). I don't yet know how long these will last in use, but so far they're performing well.

  I was pleasantly surprised that they included two charging mechanisms... the standard black 5v case you see in most battery packages, but also the latest craze in rechargeable batteries, the magnetic charging cable! I have reviewed other rechargeable batteries that uses a magnetic cable, and I had mentioned that I suspect these magnetic cables will be universal, and I was right! I took the batteries from the other ""magnetic cable"" package and it hooked up perfectly with the magnetic cable in this package. Keep in mind, the magnetic cable is the thing that is universally designed, not the plethora of rechargeable AA batteries on the market. If the batteries were not designed for magnetic cables, then it's not going to fit. Lastly, when using the black 5v case, it will charge via micro usb cable. Too bad it's not usb-c.

  I picked these to use in my Xbox controllers paired to my PC downstairs. I had gotten sick of some of my weaker rechargeable only giving a few hours of runtime.... however these batteries really changed the game! It seems that their stated capacities are correct because the controller is going on 15+ hours of battery now and it hasn't started to show low battery yet!I have tons of other NIMH batteries but none of them hold power like this.... I think the difference of 1.5V vs 1.2V (normal rechargeable) makes a difference when it comes to things like controllers (especially older ones).Overall I am really satisfied with them at the moment because my controllers basically just don't die with these batteries in them. I might even get more in the future for other controllers or higher power devices.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!

easy to charge and work great; quite expensive
","

  I’ve used lots of rechargeable batteries over the years, including NiCad and NiMH batteries.  But this is the first time I have had individual rechargeable lithium batteries in the AA size.  I like to use lithium batteries because they hold a charge a lot better than other types of rechargeables, especially when not in use for a long time.  They also tend not to develop a “memory” when charged frequently.This particular AA rechargeable battery set includes four AA lithium batteries, a 4-battery charger along with a micro-USB cable, and a unique magnetic charging cable that will charge two AA batteries at a time, also by USB.  This set does not come with an AC-USB adapter.While charging, the batteries give off a blue light that turns green when charging is complete.  It took several hours to fully charge them.  Once charged, though, they work great in any device using AA batteries.  The magnetic charger is pretty interesting, although somewhat limited in utility.  It magnetically attaches to the positive end of each battery and charges by USB.  The downside is it can only charge two batteries at a time.Overall, this is a nice set of rechargeable batteries.  It’s an expensive set, but when you consider the cost of AA alkaline batteries these days, it should save a lot of money down the road, especially when used in battery hogs like flashlights and camera flash attachments.

He dual-head magnetic charging cable is even easier to travel with, but it can only charge 2 batteries at a time. Still, it’s great for carrying in my laptop bag for just-in-case charging. I’ve found these batteries work well in my trail cameras. Overall, this set of rechargeable batteries works well and is quite handy.

  I got these rechargeable batteries for a couple of candles I have that automatically turn on and off. They were eating batteries like crazy and it was costing me a lot of money plus it's a pain to recycle batteries in my area. It states ""Built-in integrated safety circuit protects battery from over discharge/overcharge"".This came with 2 different kinds of chargers and I tried both but I really prefer the one that charges all 4 at once. It has a red light while charging and turns green when fully charged. The description of the batteries claim it takes about an hour to charge, but it took quite a bit longer than that. The other kind is magnetic and it kept attaching to any metal that was around it. Plus the fact I can only charge 2 at a time with that one.

  This comes in a small package which is great for storing when not using. I charged these batteries it took a little over 4 hours for all of them to fully charge. The light will stay red until it’s charged and then one at a time will light up green when done. I have certain lighting that requires AA batteries and regular batteries only last a few weeks.

   So far I've been very impressed by these batteries. Shipping was fast, packaging is good. I tried out both the magnetic charging and the 5V standard charger. The listing says that the magnetic charger will charge in about an hour and a half. The first battery was complete in about an hour and the second right under 1.5 hours. The two I put on the standard charger were done in about 2 hours. The lighting system for the batteries is really easy to understand, although a bit inconsistent; the magnetic charger is blue during charging and green when charged while the standard charger has a red light with flashing blue during charging and a solid green when charged. Still easy to understand though. Haven't had a lot of time to test these batteries out. I have a high powered LED flashlight that burns through batteries pretty quickly and have it on continuously just to see how long they'll last. So far they're going surprisingly long. This set didn't come with the AC plug - would be nice to see that as an option in the past, but I had a multi-USB charge adapter that worked fine with these and probably most people do as well.

  I didn't even realize these existed until I ordered them.These high-capacity Li-Ion batteries (if claims are accurate) hold a lot more power than other battery packs I have used. It seems the charging circuitry is actually inside the battery.The battery build quality seems great, and if these live up to all the claims, the batteries are probably a 5-star product - and, in fact, the batteries are a very large part of what you're paying for here.The magnetic charger is pretty slick - just plug it into a USB charger and clip the magnet to the positive end of the battery. (I'm pretty sure this method will ONLY work with these batteries (or clones) as it appears the charge has access to the negative pole here as well, and the LED is built into the battery, not the ""charger"".  Very small and convenient, just limited.The ""standard"" charger is pretty basic and not of great quality. I'm disappointed that it, too, seems to only work with these Li-Ion batteries. I assumed the charger would work with any rechargeables, but nope, they flash an error if you try to charge Nimh batteries. I'm further disappointed that one of the four bays in my charger appears to be broken as it never lights up.So, the batteries get 4-5 starsThe fast, magnetic charger gets 4 stars (would get 5 if it worked with other batteries)The standard charger gets 2 stars because it doesn't work with other batteries and is only 75% working.Overall, about 3.5 stars. I usually round up, but as these batteries are rather expensive, I'm rounding down.

  After I wrote my initial review of these I bought a second set.  I intended to use this in Vivitar 283 and 285 camera flashes.  These were the workhorse flash for the pro photographer back in the day and they're powerful but also battery hogs.  Initially all looked good so I turned off the flashes and set them aside.  Then I powered them up after sitting for a week or so and the power seemed low so I took them out to recharge them and they were seriously hot to the touch, almost hot enough on the positive end to burn me.Amazon is processing a return and giving me a refund but the man on the phone had poor English skills and couldn't answer my questions if the batteries cannot handle high draw devices.  I put a set of alkaline batteries in after this and the flashes both are working normally.  I think but cannot prove that these batteries are OK in low power draw devices but don't use them in something that normally uses up batteries quickly...

At last a true 1.5V AA rechareable batteries
","

  These batteries are great.  Ever since I replaced all of my NiMh batteries with pre-charged like Eneloops and Duracells, I haven't seen any batteries that caught my attention until this.  I love the pre-charged batteries, they have a very long shelf life.  The only problem is it is only capable of delivering 1.2V.  Some appliances and toys don't run as effective using 1.2V LSD batteries.  Particularly those with motors, they may run but can be slow and dragging.  These rechargeable Lithium batteries solved that problem.This comes with 2 types of chargers.  A 4-position  charger that plugs into a microUSB cable (included) and a dual USB charging cord.  The only thing I noticed with the later is that it heats up.The only other gripe for now is the initial cost.  Maybe when there's already a lot of manufacturers then the price will stabilize.

  These batteries are awesome, they came with two chargers, one is the typical style and the other is a magnetic wire that attaches to the battery and plugs into USB.  It works great and I think the magnet charger is turbo charger because it charges quickly. You can charge 4 at a time in the tray charger and 2 at a time with the magnet charger.

  We got these to use in our blink camera's but have not had any Blink camera batteries come up yet. So, we threw them into a couple of solar lights.

One cable with four ends to charge all the batteries at the same time is awesome. I find my self using it for other items to charge at the same time.Will update once I can insert them in a Blink camera and see how long they last.One last thing I like is the led ring that glows red while charging and green once they are full.

Normally I would get non-rechargeable batteries but every time they die I would have to look around the house for spare ones or even run to the store to get more and that was very inconvenient. This is my first time buying rechargeable batteries and I'm settled on using them from now on. It's so much more convenient whereas I can recharge them once they're dead. The charging time is also really fast and they last long before having to be charged again. My daughter really likes them and so far they've been working well with her lights. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy batteries.

Works in Nintendo Switch PowerA controllers
","

  The PowerA wireless controllers I bought for the Switch take two AA Batteries.  For a while I was using Dollar Store batteries, but after a long gaming session I was replacing them at least once.  So I decided to buy these.  First thing I noticed was I gamed for a good week before they finally died.  The charger plugs directly into one of the USB slots in the Switch and a little red light shows on each battery.  When the light goes green, they're charged.  I didn't notice how long it took because this comes with four batteries, so I just plugged in the other two good ones while the first two were charging and continued gaming.  They work very well, good enough that I'm buying a second set, this time for my cable remotes in the bedroom.

  What's nice about these you can charge all for it once they have a very clear light on them when they are fully charged I paid around $20 for them $5 a piece but if you go into the store and check the price of lithium ion rechargeable that's not a bad deal at all besides do you take 1000 charges I love them

  I've started using these USB type batteries in the weather station sending unit by Lacrosse. In the colder weather I could get about 55 days of use with either Duracell or Energizer AA type. These USB batteries are getting less, but too short of time yet to get a good average to compare. However when they go down, change out and recharge! Cost savings are building.

Unreliable waste of money
","

  I don’t have a high opinion of these, they are very unreliable. I use them in my camera flash. Sometimes I will charge them fully And they will operate normally, allow me to take hundreds of pictures with the flash. Other times they are fully charged, I put them in the flash, and it gives me a low battery alert right away, like they didn’t charge at all even though they were supposedly fully charged. I had never heard of this brand before and tried to save a few bucks, but now I regret it. Go with a more reliable brand.Edit: I originally bought 8 of these, so I can have 4 inside my flash and 4 charging at the same time. Even with all 8 supposedly fully charged right now, the flash has no battery power at all no matter what combination of 4 I put in. These batteries are a completely worthless waste of money. Do yourself a favor and get a more well-known brand.

Don't actually work in Blink 2 outdoor cameras like some reviews claim

  I bought these specifically because some reviewers state these work in their Blink 2 outdoor cameras.  The ones I received do not work in mine.  When you sync the camera with your hub, it will connect and convince the system that all is well, but when you try to live-stream the camera there isn't enough amperage or current supplied to work, so it reports an error.  Otherwise, the batteries are nice, being li and rechargeable in a AA format.  Clever design as well.

They haven't refined the circuitry enough- devices won't always accept them
","

  For those of you that don't know how this works, lithium batteries have a ~3.5 volt nominal charge depending on type and a much greater variance in voltage between charged and discharged states. In order for them to work in place of a 1.5 volt alkaline AA battery, they have to have an onboard voltage regulator to convert the voltage as well as control the USB charging functionality as lithium chemistry needs safety monitoring when charging. This presents several issues. Firstly your device sees the battery at a constant 1.5 volt charge, which makes it think that the batteries are full the entire charge cycle until the onboard converter cuts out on minimum safety (yet another quirk with lithium, they are unsafe to charge ever again if they drop below a minimum safe voltage) and your device goes dead without warning. The second issue is that I am fairly certain the converter goes into a sleep state when it doesn't recognize a load so that it doesn't waste power. This presents an issue for a lot of more intelligent devices that go through a rapid self test when you turn them on. In the case of my old Pentax DSLR it registers that the battery is dead, the indicator flashes and refuses to boot when you turn it on. I have tested all batteries involved with a volt meter, everything registers as a near perfect 1.5 V but their onboard circuitry clashes with the check in my device. The lesson is if you buy these you cannot take for granted that they will work in anything you have. It will actually have very mixed results.

Lasts a long time, charges really fast
","

  I use these in my Magellan eXplorist 110 and Canon PowerShot A530. Those two things chew through AA batteries like nothing else. I've been using these for a week, and these new batteries last a lot longer than my Eneloops, let alone alkalines. Not only that, they charge really fast. My Eneloops used to take all night before they were ready. These batteries take an hour and a half, and they're done; I'm using a basic 5W 2.1A charger. And plus I don't need to lug that bulky charger anymore since I can use that USB cable with my phone's charger.The only con is that the batteries' sides are not perfectly smooth, so sometimes they'd get stuck in my camera, and I'd have to rotate and jiggle them before they come out.20190707 (one month) update: first of all, DON'T charge the batteries while they're in your devices (like in my picture). They get really, REALLY hot. The batteries got hot enough to burn my fingers. So take them out and then charge them. They'll still be warm when charging, but they won't be dangerously hot. The batteries still last a long time in the devices that I use them in, but - and maybe it's just my devices - the battery indicators on my devices give false readings with these USB batteries. Like my GPS receiver (Magellan eXplorist 110) will show that the batteries are still fully or mostly charged, even when in reality, they have been used all day and are nearly exhausted. Same digital camera (Canon PowerShot A530). The batteries still last a very long time though. A full charge will give me almost two days with my GPS receiver (NiMH and alkalines give me about a day). It's just hard to gauge how charged the batteries really are with the built-in indicators, so just to be safe I always fully charge them before going out with them.

  When I put in freshly charged Eneloop AA batteries into my Odyssey controllers they only are detected at a good charge for a short period of time.

  Update: After deciding, I wanted to return the item, I tried to pull it out of the Logitech Harmony Remote and it won't budge.

All in all, not happy with this product and I would advise to be careful when placing the battery inside your device.Pretty pricey for rechargeable batteries but I guess that is to be expected since it is relatively new. Charges quite fast but the only issue I have with it is that the sizing is a bit off, which makes it hard to put it into a device.

slightly bigger than an alkaline AA, but great battery
","

  I've tried these batteries in replacement of my NiMH rechargeables. They work really well. Lasts a little longer than those batteries, but doesn't seem to last quite as long as an alkaline or non-rechargeable lithium battery. But for the convenience of having the charger go with you anywhere is awesome. You don't have to carry a separate charger or tons of spare batteries. They charge pretty quickly and seem to maintain their charge in storage as well as any lithium rechargeable battery does. My only complaint is that the form factor is slightly bigger than other AA batteries. I've tried them in a few instances with my video game accessories and it's tough to get them in and out. While other rechargeable batteries and alkalines fit without issue. The difference is mm, but enough and hard to get a picture of. I hope there's a v2 coming that reduces the form factor.

one of the best rechargeable battery options for my use cases
","

  I've been really impressed with this product.  There are a few very key areas these are better than cells like eneloop.* they are the exact same size as alkaline AAs, most NiMh/NiCd are slightly larger so they get stuck in some devices like maglights and door locks and some remotes.* they last a long time in storage.  NiMh/NiCd are dead after 3 months if you use them or not.  Do you expect your flashlight or remote to work if you haven't used it for awhile?  If you do then these are the way to go.* USB charging.  we all have USB chargers, if you need to charge it you have greater ability to charge it.* voltage sensitive devices that don't work correctly on 1.2V will love these batteries.  analog wall clocks don't keep time on 1.2V!most people don't really understand the nuance of rechargeable batteries, this product is a great example.Some devices don't work well with 1.2V cells (wall clocks for example), the mAh rating depends on the discharge rate.  You can't trust that a battery with 2500mAh rating is better than a 1400mAh rating.  this is even more true when comparing different cell chemistry.The same cell can be claimed to be different capacities if the test discharge rate is lower or higher (lower discharge rates simulates higher capacity)Weight, sure.  that matters sometimes.This one is the biggest for me, self-discharge rate.  This is how much energy is lost to the ""air"" vs being drawn off from the device.  In the case of devices like TV remotes, wall clocks, door locks, flashlights, radios, etc.  the time they are left inactive and loosing charge is very high.  In these cases, a 2500mAh NiMh won't last as long as a 1400mAh LiIon cell because there is more lost to the air in NiMh cells.In situations that you're using all the charge in a short time period (during one day), the NiMh will last longer.you also have to consider that mAh is different than mWh because one technology is 1.2V and one is 1.5V so the amps (A) drawn are less but the watts (w) drawn are the same.

  These seem like good batteries, but when I put a 10 ohm resister across the battery to produce a 150ma load, it consistently takes around 8.5 hrs to deplete.

Okay for moderate Xbox use - functional but not amazing
","

  I bought these primarily for use for use in my Xbox one controllers - the set of four is perfect because I can swap them out in pairs.  Battery life is acceptable, I can get maybe 12 to 16 hours out of it using my elite controller with headphones plugged in.  The big con is that there is no warning when close to depletion, with normal alkaline cells Xbox will tell you ""your batteries are getting low"" - so when they die the controller shuts off instantly and that's about it.The frustrating part is when I plug them into a controlled usb charging station, each cell only takes about 500 mAh before indicating they're full after dying in my controller - so either the voltage regulation circuit drops off too fast to keep powering my controller or the 1500 mAh rating is grossly exaggerated.  Knowing this, I simply swap them out every couple gaming nights and don't have an issue.I do really like the USB rechargability, everyone has USB micro chargers around and it comes with an adapter to charge all 4 at once.When charging I see a peak current of around 500 mA per cell - so for my normal usage it takes an hour to top them back off.  Peak observed temperature during recharge is around 116 F in the end where the charging regulator is.Not a big deal, but the LED's are not very bright, if you're in a sunlit room you'll have to cover them up to see if the charge indicator is red or green - very easy to see in a dark room.A side note if you're picky on this sort of stuff - the text on the side is clearly in need of some proper English translation.The plastic case works very nicely for holding them when not in use.Overall I don't regret the purchase, it met my intended needs - but am curious to see how well they last over time.

I also like the fact that they recharge with a micro USB connection and that a 4 way splitter is included.

Fantastic Batteries for Smart Lock
","

  I recently bought these to replace the 1.2V NiMH rechargeable batteries that I was using in a smart lock, and they are so, so much better. They can put out a lot of power and don't have the typical voltage drop of regular batteries which is great to power the motor in a smart lock.If you use it in a lock, though, make sure the backup key is accessible. There's not much of a warning when a cell needs recharging. The battery will just fully shut off.

Batteries of the future

  The charging cradle was always what kept me from buying rechargeable batteries so I bought this as soon as I saw it existed. In short these are the batteries of the future, today.However I don't know how many charge cycles the batteries will last for but the charge seems about as long as  a regular disposable battery.Personally I like the design that has one end come off to reveal a USB connection instead of the microusb slot in the side, even if this model lasts a tiny bit longer than the other.

Simple To Use, working great on electronic soor dead bolt lock by kwikset

  ***Update*** The battwries have been working out GREAT, but make darn sure you align cables to charge. Keypad battery life is about 2 months. So the lithiums are lasting longer than rayovac alkaline cells. Highly recommended!  Still lost a star due to port potwntial damage.  /Update***I have an electronic door lock (keypad) that loves to eat batteries (4xAA), and tired of changing / throwing away batteries every 3-4 weeks.  Tried NiCD and NiMH, but terminal voltage is too low and makes the lock think that batteries are exhausted very quickly.  Lithium AA batteries work pretty well, but cost quite a bit more than alklaline and are not rechargeable.  Found these, and with a regulated 1.5v output, pack should always be a consistent voltage despite last time they were charged.  When the batteries need recharging, can just pop out and plug in.  Easier said than done.  The charge ports require precise alignment with the ""charge cable harness"", I can see that inattention or carelessness can cause the ports to break.  That is only complaint.  Batteries have  been in place for about 2 weeks now, and are showing great potential for this particular use.  I will most likely order several other sets for the other keypad locks, though I am still on the fence about how the charger connects.  Upside to these is that a standard micro-usb is used.  Others have a proprietary charger that contact rings on battery terminal.  At time of this writing, these particular batteries are unavailable, so will have to find an alternate.  Most are less than 800mah, these were rated higher and were biggest reason for purchase.

I've wanted a 1.5v AA rechargeable battery for years, decades really!
","

  I worked as a Wedding Photographer years ago. I used AA Alkaline batteries in  large quantities. I tried rechargeable AA's, but the voltage is 1.2v so camera flash recharge time was slower. Recently I did a mid-day outdoor wedding as a favor. Start time was noon so harsh shadows were a problem. To lighten shadows I let my big flash unit fill with a bounce attachment for the 5 hours more than 100 flash shots. I knew this event would be a good test AA 1.5v rechargeable Li-on's.  I wore out, but these light weight batteries never had any flash recharge slow down like Alkaline batteries would. After 90 to 120 minutes charging, they were ready to go again.  I'll be back for more TWHARF AA and AAA 1.5v rechargeable Li-on's.

  These are great, no cap to lose unlike others on the market, or have a seal deteriorate over time causing the cap to fall off.

  I am changing my review of these batteries.  The second time that I charged them they became VERY HOT within minutes.  This is not supposed to happen as per the manufacturer.

  Bought these for the novelty of something new and clever. My order arrived - just four batteries in a plastic case - no charger like the others received - $18.93 (Now charging $4 more).  I charged them fully and then put them in the plastic case and gave them to my wife as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.She put them in a walkie talkie but they just lasted a day on standby. I asked her to charge them over night because I had charged them two weeks earlier and maybe they had run down on their own.The walkie only took three AA batteries but she charged all four overnight. I went out to cut wood and just put three AA batteries I got from Harbor Freight (yellow ones) for free in my walkie. We didn't talk too much but did yack a bit.By evening her batteries were almost dead and my walkie still showed some life left. I think that the size/volume of the USB section reduces its ability to hold a charge as compared to a full sized lithium AA. Turns out these batteries are not lithium Ion but Ni-Mh.They are novel but not worth the money in my estimation. I looked on AliExpress and you can buy these for less than $2 a piece. If they had been 1.5v and lithium Ion it would be a good deal.

  These are great for your money, But are they really worth the extra money? Im asking this question because you can buy normal rechargeable for around the same price if not cheaper with a charger. If your someone that travels a lot and you have a laptop and portable charger then yes these are great, But for the most part it would be cheaper just to get the normal non USB or Micro-USB AA/AAA/9V/D. The life is around the same. If you want to buy these because of the look and the function then buy all means do so. I bought them because I have both USB and normal US outlets.The build quality feels great and does imitate the feeling of normal AAs and does go green when fully charged. I can use a Xbox controller for around 3-4 days and my daughter can play with her toys for a full day. These are a good buy even if you want something to fit that modern life style.

  By making the cap a cover for the USB slot I feel like this is much easier to use than the batteries I've seen that use a USB-mini side port.  With those if the mounting was done improperly, the cable won't either slot properly or stay attached, and in both cases the ones I had didn't charge properly.With these, I can plug them in, leave them overnight, and I'm good to go.  They're great for both my wireless mouse and my Xbox Controller, so I can play anything on my laptop at home, or on the go with no problems.The only reason I don't give them a full 5-star is I wish the batteries would last a little longer, and I would love to see  the material used to keep the cap attached to the main battery to be made of something more durable-seeming.

I could still use it in my keyboard, since it used less power, but today the battery stopped charging all together.

  I love EBL product however their batteries seamed always under perform a bit compare to the other product. For example when testing with 3 different testers I am getting about 80% of capacity while product like Tenavolt 2775mWh and AmpTorrent 3000mWh in the same type batteries overperform after multiple testing. First you have to concert mWh to mAh to compare to NiMh capacity and remember that NiMh are 1.2V batteries (for example Amazon Basics 2000Mah x 1.2v are 2400mWh capacity). This EBL, as well as Tenavolt and AmpTorrent are 1.5v batteries. I don't understand why last 2 I've mentioned have lower rating than EBL. Other than capacity raiting i think its a great product and performs well. I hope that helps.

  So I bought these batteries hoping for something to replace my 1.2v rechargeable batteries that weren't providing quite enough power for my VR controllers.After charging them up they worked great for a total of two songs on beat saber (approx 7 minutes) before the controllers lost power.I recharged them today to give them another shot and was getting low battery indicators from the time I put them in until the controllers powered off 5 minutes later.I realize that one of the features of these batteries is that they are supposed to provide their peak of 1.5v for a larger percentage of the battery life, and for the short time they managed to keep a charge they worked great, but 7 minutes most likely sounds like they are either defective or just more garbage products as seems to be the trend lately.Either way I can't recommend wasting your time ordering these and will be returning them.

  There customer service is great, they reached out to me because of my experience. But because the batteries are not compatible with standard charging methods and only can be charged with the usb charger I still don't recommend them. And the usb port in the battery is a problem with getting dirt and debris inside the port and not being able to charge properly. Plus apon further review the capacity is misleading, only about half of what is rated at.If the batteries were compatible with stand charging and usb then they would be recommended.

  I’ve been waiting for a true 1.5 volt AA rechargeable battery all my life.  I was pretty excited for these when I saw them. In the past you had rechargeable AA’s but they where only 1.2v and not very high capacity.  Then lithium came along, but they where all 3.7 volt. You could make that work on some things using a blank “dummy” battery but the voltages still weren’t right and if your device takes 6 batteries there’s no way to get the voltage close using dummy batteries with those..  but then these batteries can along and solved all those problems. My main use for them is in my hands free stainless garbage can. It has a motion sensor and opens when your hand is near it and runs on 6 AA batteries. I would go through batteries every 1.5 months and it seemed like a real waste to me. The new EBL Lithium rechargeable batteries lasted 1 month and 10 days before needing recharged, so maybe a week less than conventional alkaline batteries. The one big difference I noticed though was these batteries worked strong right up to the point they were dead and could no longer open the lid.  Alkaline batteries lasted slightly longer, but with degraded operation for the last week or so which gave plenty of warning the batteries where going dead. I assume this has to do with the internal circuitry that protects the batteries from voltage dropping too low.  The best part is when the batteries go dead they charge up in an hour or two (not sure exactly as I walked out of the room).  I waited a month to review this so I could see how they compared with alkaline batteries and in my personal application I can say I am very happy with them. I’ve bought two 4 packs of these batteries and will likely buy more in the near future.

Checked with my multimeter.
","

  I just received these batteries with a low charge.  Suits me.  They claim to hold a constant voltage across their entire charge cycle, and I can easily put that to the test right off the bat.  An Alkaline battery cell is 1.5V.  Most rechargeable AA batteries are Nickel-Metal Hydride (NIMH), which only has a 1.2V cell.  I’m going to scrutinize these with my multimeter to see how they hold up.The first thing I did upon receiving this package was test the voltage of all the batteries.  They were all very near 1.49V.  I then put them on the charger, and it took approximately 95 minutes to achieve a full charge so I know they didn’t have much juice originally.  These batteries are consistently showing a voltage very close to 1.49V.  I’ve included a photo of my multimeter reading 1.491V and the average voltage I’m reading across all four batteries is 1.493V.  Fortunately, there’s no discernible difference between these batteries at a full charge, or at a low charge.  Whereas an alkaline battery will start with 1.5-1.6V and the voltage gradually diminishes, this one seems to run at 100% voltage up until the end of its life.  I’m very happy with my initial tests on these batteries.  The output voltage is constant and essentially perfect at damn near exactly 1.5V, far better than a 1.2V NIMH rechargeable battery. I even had one read exactly 1.5V (pictured).As others here have pointed out most AA battery brands advertise their life in milliamp hours, but this advertises itself in milliwatt hours.  So the 3300 mWh converts to 2200 mAh.  (3300 mWh / 1.5V = 2200 mAh)  This isn’t a problem with the battery per se, just the marketing.I purchased these a bit experimentally.  I’m an electrician.  After burning up a few too many AAs and AAAs on some of my less-powerful battery operated tools, I’ve been looking into getting rechargeables.  I was primarily intrigued by the high capacity, the constant voltage, and the quick and easy recharge of these.  I also needed to be able to recharge these quickly with or without access to power, as I can do courtesy of my Makita ADP05 (pictured).  Between the constant (and correct) voltage, high energy capacity, fast recharge, and convenient USB charger, my first impression of these is very positive.  I’ll update this if anything else worth mentioning comes to my attention.

  Says fully charged, but won't work at all.  Put these batteries in a known-good Canon strobe, batteries wouldn't even handle a single flash.  Worthless.

The new set will power my Canon 600EXII-RT stobe for a few flashes, but only with very long recycle times, far longer than I am accustomed to with either alkaline or Eneloop.EBL customer service contacted me again, and that's where it got really weird.  Their customer service person, a Joseph Huang, tells me that these AA batteries can't be used as replacements for alkaline or NiMH (e.g., Eneloop) batteries.  That, even though their own product description says they are 1.5 volt AA batteries.  Then he got insisted that I should try ""other suitable devices"" despite EBL's own description saying ""Long battery life up to 1200 cycles AA rechargeable lithium battery, ideal for digital cameras, remote controls, toys, and more for high current applications.""  My Canon strobes are high current for a brief period, yet these batteries do not work.I've read the other reviews that say these batteries work great.  Sure wish I had gotten such a set.

  Use these in my outdoor devices because they work even when it's well below freezing. They also last much longer than regular batteries. Regular alkaline batteries start showing a drop in voltage after about a week and will no longer operate the door after about 2 1/2 months. These lithium batteries still show 100% after 5 weeks.EBL lithium AA batteries are the strongest I have found and last the longest.

Do you really need these?

  If you absolutely need 1.5V and quick recharge then these are your babies. The mWh rating is deceptive ... these batteries have lower capacity than their NiMh cousins and won't last all that long in a lot of devices. If you have a flashlight that is for occasional use than these will work. If you are using them for emergency lighting on lanterns etc I would pass. There is nothing wrong with them when the application fits, otherwise I would go with a high capacity NiMh cell. NiMh cells out performed these in almost every application. As I said there are situations where you might need these but for the most part I would pass. In truth the mAh rating is more like a 17 or 1800 NiMh cell when you consider that the the sustained 1.5V will cause them to discharge faster.

It's so cool! But storage capacity is misleading, It's in Mwh instead of the standard Mah
","

  I really like this battery because its 1.5v, it's Lithium, so you're getting all the power instead of another other than die off as you use them. But the capacity is misleading.It's listed as 3300 MWh, while the standard EBL rechargeable is 2800 MAh. The capacity of the lithium battery is 2/3 the standard rechargeable battery at only 2200 mah.So they are great if you need something with extra power like audio equipment or something sensitive or more powerful. For regular use, the regular rechargeable aa EBL battery is better because the capacity is 1/3 larger.I ran by sons hot wheel track with these at the Standard EBL's ran for 4hrs23min. The lithium EBL Rechargeable lasted for almost 2hrs. It ran those motors SO SO fast, which is fantastic, but the run time, in reality, was less than 1/2.I recharged and tested them a few times and got the same results. I shot a review on YouTube if someone wants to see me to the whole break down. @dothingsmakestuffThey are perfect some AA to carry in my backpack because of their easy of charge, but at $5 a piece, they don't replace all my standard EBL batteries!

  The only thing I would improve would be higher MAH and I wish all these companies would quit trying to trick people by using  MWh instead of MAH it is deceiving because no batteries ever used this rating until the new 1.5v rechargeable came out. That being said these batteries are well built, charge really fast and have the highest Mah , 2200 , witch is the highest available on the market at this time!!!!! EBL also has the best customer support staff that I have come across, if you have any problems they fix it immediately without having to jump through a bunch of hoops or 15 phone calls!!!!!!!!!! 5 Stars all the way!!!!Now I wish they would come out with some AAA's with 1.5 volts and 1100MAh witch is what their 1.2 voly batteries currently have and we could all go green and quit buying alkiline batteries and start using recharigables, we have the technology to make great rechargiables so lets start doing it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  I've got AA battery-powered temperature sensors in both my refrigerator and freezer. Most types of batteries don't work well once they get below  0°F but I've read that lithium can still operate down to -40°F. That made these AA'a the perfect choice for my situation: They're Lithium and they're rechargeable so economical in the long run.I've had them in use continuously for the last month and they've been perfect. When I used to use NiMh rechargeables or alkalines, the temperature readouts, especially from the freezer, would often become intermittent especially below zero. That has stopped happening completely. Once I charged the Blackubes up using the 4-headed USB cable that comes with them, they have performed perfectly, 24/7, ever since.

Very Useful, With an Unexpected Problem
","

  This is a really interesting concept and this is coming from someone that 3D printed AA to D cell adapters.  In our ever-common world of rechargeable devices, I still find myself looking for standard Alkaline batteries.  Smart locks, my Fluke Linksprinter that I use for work, and still most every remote I can think of still use AA cells.  These are all most frustrating when they go dead.Ok, so these are $26 for four AA batteries.  That is not a small chunk of change.A typical alkaline AA battery seems to be around 1200 to 1900 mAh.  This battery is lithium-based and has an 1850 mAh capacity each so that would be basically on par with a standard battery.  The package comes with a four-way split micro USB charger for charging them all at once.  There is a led that glows red while charging and turns green when done.  This version has the charging plug on the top near the positive terminal so you do have to take them out to charge them.In testing this product I have found quite an unexpected problem: they can get easily lost.  It seems they were grabbed up by the kids and used for some unknown device.  Sooo basically, I am forced to wait for the said device to go dead or check through them all before I can find them.  There is also the possibility that they could be thrown out accidentally if someone is not paying attention.  When I get them back I will make bright labels for them and they are going to work to live in my Fluke.

  Rather than burn through a set of AA every other week, I just rotate these in and out now.  They literally plug into a micro USB charger, though I still use the 4 headed dragon these came with.  Time will tell how long they last, but the construction is well made.  5 stars, but a recommendation you don't put these into something that will see a lot of abuse because I can't tell how thick the protective casing is.

Clever design, very different from other rechargeables
","

  There are one or two things about these that I think could have been done better, but these are some of the best rechargeable AA batteries I’ve ever used.  Normal, non-rechargeable AA batteries put out 1.5 volts.  For some reason that I’ve never understood rechargeable batteries, whether they’re NiCad, NiMh, and even the ultra popular Enloops only put out 1.2 volts.  Now most devices are designed to operate on less voltage than the combined total of the batteries they take, but not all of them.  The ones that are actually expecting the full voltage tend to react either by drawing more current from the batteries to compensate and making the rechargeable batteries last half as long, or malfunctioning in a variety of ways.  The Blackube rechargeables are the first I’ve ever used that actually put out the same 1.5 volts as a standard AA.The full voltage aspect is probably these can’t be recharged with a normal AA battery charger.  They have a micro USB port instead.  This has the advantage that you done actually need a separate device to charge them.  The 4-pack comes with a 4-way charging cable, however the carrying case only has room for the batteries not the cable, so it might be easy to accidentally separate them.  If you lose the cable, you can still use any old micro USB cable to charge them, but only one battery per cable at a time.The capacity on these is really impressive.  I’ve been using a pair in my XBONE controller and after 12 hours of play time they still show as 100% charged.These are by far my favorite rechargeables because they’re compatible with devices that are traditionally not compatible with rechargeables (because of the goofy 1.2V vs 1.5V thing), they recharge very quickly on a quick charger circuit and they have an amazing amount of capacity.

  I feel old sometimes with all these new-fangled things coming out, but hey, I have a set of rechargeable batteries and saw these - the fact that they can be charged via usb was so cool!  They charged quickly and work great in my devices that use AA batteries.  I like having some batteries that can be charged in my car or with a charged battery pack should I need some for a light or other item.  The fact that the batteries come with a charging cord so they are all charged at the same time is perfect.  I would recommend these to anyone who prefers having rechargeable batteries.

Rechargeable power
","

  These are rechargeable AA batteries that have a high capacity and have a long life. They are 1850 mAh for lasting power, and they have up to 1000 recharge cycles. That means that each of the batteries has the potential to replace 1000 AA batteries. Even if they last half of that, they will save 500 batteries from landing in the trash. This 4 pack could eventually replace 4000 AA batteries.They work exactly like any regular alkaline battery, providing long lasting performance and power to your devices. Once they lose power, simply connect them to the included USB charging cable, and in a little over an hour, they are ready for use again. Each battery has a micro USB port for recharging. They have a red LED indicator light  when charging, then turning green when done.  There is also a plastic storage box for keeping them organized and portable. The batteries carry a 3 year warranty, and Blacklube offers a 100% money back guarantee if they don't perform as expected. That shows confidence in a product. Together with all of the possibilities these batteries offer, they are a great value and I give them 5 stars.

High quality rechargeable batteries...
","

  I've recently decided to get back into rechargeable batteries. We tried many years ago, but the tech was juts not there, they did not work all that well. We just go through so many batteries and I hate to think about them going into garbage. Sure not good for the environment.So I was happy to grab this set. They are also the first set of USB charging batteries, such a great idea. They came boxed well with a storage case for the batteries. I also love how you can charge all 4 at the same time, very handy. Helpful that have a light on the top so you know they are charging.Put them in a RC car my wife recently got me and they worked as batteries should. Only slight negative, it would be nice if they worked in a charger. Not a big deal. Can't have it both ways.Some might say they are expensive, but if they do charge 1,000 times, they are going to be well worth it. Plus all the regular batteries these keep from ending up in the trash.Overall, really happy with these. Will update this if anything changes. As of now, highly recommend.

Good for Flashlights but Not Radios
","

  Most of these no-name, never-heard-of batteries are rewrapped rejects from larger companies (mine are already coming unwrapped) that didn't meet their quality standards but they are still serviceable. I like having a micro usb port on the batteries to charge them, but you've got to watch the marketing. As of this writing, July 2020, Delipow is marketing these batteries as 2800mWh instead of mAh so that makes these about 1870mAh devices (1.5v × 1870mAh = 2805mWh). They aren't lying, but might catch some people off guard, they did me at first, but that was still plenty high enough for what I was buying these for so that didn't bother me too much. However, I will say that these are not good for radios. I bought these AA batteries for a cassette player/radio but they give off too much interference to pick up anything on the fm or am stations (a problem that is alleviated with alkaline or zinc chloride batteries), so now I'll be using these for flashlights or something instead. They're serviceable for the cassette side of things though and don't interfere with larger radios quite as bad so you're milage may vary, but for me I'll be looking for alternatives without the micro USB port (which I like for the AAA little brothers of these I bought for a penlight).

  These batteries are really easy to recharge and use. They seem to work fine in any device. There is only one draw back. The total power that they can provide is similar to conventional batteries.

  I was tired of going through batteries to power my Magic Mouse and Trackpad, so I decided to give these a try.  I am writing this initial review at the end of the first discharge cycle.  These batteries lasted a little over a month in the mouse and trackpad, which don't get used daily.  I don't have an exact comparison with how long alkaline batteries lasted, but it feels like they lasted longer.  I suspect this is because these batteries have the charging circuitry built in, so there is less volume for the battery itself.  Still, they fulfill the objective of not wasting batteries and contributing to landfill waste, and they're easy to charge...no special charger needed.I'll also add that the battery percentage measurement is not at all helpful when using these batteries.  These batteries will output 100% with no drop in power right up until they quit.

I'll continue testing it every night to see how long they last.Update: I charged the batteries and put three of them and my small table light and the only lasted 1 hour and 11 minutes. Is this normal for these batteries, I hope not.

  Don't get me wrong about this product as of 5 stars quality. Number 1 reason why I will give you just only 4 Stars because the size in diameter is nearly 1mm. wider than standard AA throw away of one time use batteries. I had tried it in my Coleman brand LED flashlight that will take 6 of AA batteries in long barrel tube that I have to bang my flashlight to able get my stuck batteries out of my flashlight. So I still use this same batteries for my higher-powered walkie talkie that is 100% susceptible. So I had bought TENAVOLTS brand is very similar as this USB Lithium-Ion to 1.5 volt from primary 3.7 volt. At least TENAVOLTS AA battery will fit into my same LED flashlight.

  Was a bit sceptical about this product but after my Amazon basics rechargeable batteries started to not charge I figured I'd try something new and unique.

  So for starters I have never bought batteries that charge with micro usb chargers. So I find these pretty awesome!

  I remember the days where you just toss the batteries out once their life span is up. Then came rechargeable batteries where there a bulky cradle you have to insert the batteries in and the cradle pretty much covered up your wall socket completely. Now...USB rechargeable batteries...ha! Genius! No more messing with bulky cradles and nowadays, I’d say 98% of electronics are USB rechargeable. Meaning the convenience of recharging your batteries without relying solely on a wall socket! It charges really fast. While charging there is a blue ring that lights up to let you know it’s charging. Once fully charged, the blue rings turn off. I’m using the batteries for my tv remotes and they’ve been working fine. Love the convenience of charging the batteries. Total recommend. 👍

  So these batteries haven't had the best reviews. For this reason I have held off on buying these until they showed up as a Lightning Deal two days ago. I own several other Blackube batteries and they are all great. So I figured for the Lightning Deal price I would give them a try.Unfortunately one of the four batteries was dead on arrival. The first three charged and worked no problem but the fourth would never light green from a full charge. So I used my battery tester on all four and one obviously doesn't work.I contacted Amazon Chat about the issue and they just gave me a full refund and told me I could keep the three that worked. I needed four to work for what I was going to use them for, but I guess I will hold onto the three for now.Again, other batteries from this company have worked great, but the AAAs just need better quality control I think.

Could Just Be Mine BUT The Charge Cord Is Only Capable Of Charging Two Batteries At The Same Time

  I've noticed when charging the batteries that if I attempt to charge all four batteries at the same time, the lights will turn off, indicating a full charge but the batteries will not be fully charged, they'll die in less than half the time. I also know that the batteries aren't fully charged because I can plug them back in and the lights will turn back on and stay on for the same period of time. I have them connected to a 3a usb outlet, which must mean each battery would only be getting about 0.75a each, which should only mean a longer charge time, not a lower max charge.Otherwise the batteries, when fully charged, hold up well for around 6-8 hours before needing a recharge.Not much left to say about them. Great value for the quality, wish the charging cable or the internal charge chips were better.

trade offs with NiCD/NiMH
","

  I have a bunch of NiMH batteries. And for a lot of things they are fine. But you have to charge them in pairs. They take a long time to charge and they slowly fade away. Not great for devices that use 3 batteries. Or something that you need to supply with a constant high power. I bought a bunch of these for use in under cabinet lighting, and aquarium gravel vac, and my wireless weather station. The under cabinet lighting, just sucks batteries dry. And these are no different, in fact in that application they don't last nearly as long as alkaline or NiMH. But they do stay brighter longer. The gravel vac is the same situation. The fade of power made it frustrating to use. These are constant. Full suction all the time. If they do die, there's just no suction at all. It's a very clear indicator. And charging doesn't take 8 hours. plug these into a USB port and they are good in an hour or two. Finally, the weather station. It seems like those batteries are always freezing and dying or over heating and dying. These are less sensitive to temperature swings. And recharging 3 of these batteries is so much easier. I don't have to cycle them through the charger like I would the NiMHs. NiMHs don't like it when you pair a dead battery with a fully charged one. These don't care. You can charge 1 or 3 no problem.I'd love to see a longer run time but the charging convenience and steady power more than make up for their weaknesses.One thing I would really love to see is a double length battery. Basically 2x AA batteries permanently end to end. Thus you could maximize the capacity and reduce the regulation/charge circuitry. My gravel vac uses these and the under cabinet light could benefit from them as well.

  The Idea is a good one, and for the most part it works... Until it doesn't... after a few recharges of these batteries the Controller chip begins to fail an releases a full 5V of power into whatever electronic device you have it loaded into. Subsequently Most sensitive electronic devices cannot handle the extra 3.5 Volts and fry up. I have a few damaged devices to prove it. One being a Wii remote. These are not high amp draw devices... I would advice caution when purchasing these Batteries.

  These batteries are a compromise that reduces available capacity for the ability to recharge via any standard USB port. Make sure you know what you are getting before purchase, but they are pretty good if you understand the pros and cons.They hold less than standard rechargeable batteries, but you can use any common Micro USB. One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that you don't strictly need to use their 4-to-1 cable—regular cables work fine.I work somewhere where I need a small flashlight often, but not for that long at each use. I wanted to be able to pop out the battery and recharge it at my desk using the cables I already have. The constant 1.5V instead of the 1.2V NiMH gives you will provide a slightly brighter flashlight with a more consistent output.

","

  I've been using these batteries in a digital voice recorder for about nine months.Pros:-charges really fast, like 30 minutes from empty to full-doesn't need a bulky charger. I use the same 5v 1A power supply that came with my phone.Neutral, but important:-provides a constant 1.5v supply. I think this results in inaccurate remaining capacity readings. My voice recorder determines the battery's remaining capacity by looking at its voltage, and since the voltage stays at a constant 1.5v even right before they die, the battery icon will always show a full charge even when it's just about to die. I can't tell you how many times I've used my voice recorder just for it to die all of a sudden. I never know what the battery's true remaining capacity is, so I charge them whenever I can. I think it would be a really good idea if the manufacturer put a little lcd display on these batteries that constantly show the remaining capacity because you might not be able to trust the built-in battery meter if your device has one.Cons:-self-discharges really fast, even if you don't use them. I tried using them in my Roku remote control, but it's such a hassle because they run out of power so fast. I found myself needing to recharge these like once a week, and I use the remote for maybe a total of a minute a day (turn on TV, adjust volume, pick a movie, turn off TV). Stick with alkaline or low-self-discharge NiMH if you're thinking of using these in remotes. They will not be good.I probably won't buy USB-rechargeable batteries again unless a) they self-discharge much slower and b) they came with an LCD to show the remaining charge.

  I bought these AA cells for a very specific reason; I did not want to have to travel with another charger for AA cells besides the USB multiport charger I always pack for phones, tablets, etc. These cells with builtin charging circuitry fit this need with an important side benefit, they weigh almost a 1/3 less than regular AA batteries. However, the capacity a 6% less at 2.25Wh (1.5Ax1.5V) versus 2.4Wh for a 2000mAH NiMH battery that operates at 1.2V.You do need to provide your own 10W charger, as each cell will draw 2.5W. Besides the 4 cells, a USB-A to four microUSB plug power cable is provided. The cable is only 6"" long, so if you plug this cable into a 2A charger, and the charger into most receptacle, the cells will not touch the floor. However, any appropriate USB power cable and charger should work. Please note, if you use the provided power cable, it only supports charging and all the connections are in parallel. I will probably use that cable when I travel despite its short length, since my multiport charger has a long power cable.

Use cases more limited than I expected

  I bought 4 of the 1700mah AAs due to their supposed ability to handle a greater current than the 1500mah ones.The devices I intended to use them in are: 1) a ""spinbrush"" toothbrush that needs two AAs; 2) a micro-touch hair trimmer that needs one AA.The results in the spinbrush were disappointing. Using two freshly charged Blackubes, the device's motor sputtered on and off, and wouldn't spin the brush at all if any resistance was placed on the brush (e.g., if I put the brush against my teeth). I had to go back to my Eneloop NiMH batteries for the brush as they can handle the device fine (though when voltage drops to the 1.25 range the brush speed is slow for my liking which is why I liked the idea of the constant 1.5v discharge of the Blackubes).In the micro-touch trimmer, the device seems to run OK with the Blackube battery. The motor has noticeably more speed due to the 1.5v discharge than an Eneloop at its normal 1.2-ish range.I don't know if there's something unique about the spinbrush's electronics that challenges the Blackubes, but I expect I'll use the ones I bought in remote controls that are picky for higher voltages and in the micro-touch trimmer.I'm disappointed that these aren't able to spin the head of the toothbrush. I'd be wary of buying them for anything motorized.

The light went out, I put it on charge but both the green and the red lights were on at once...I though Uh Oh...sure enough, the battery is not dead, but the electronics have failed.

When I put the Blackube batteries in, I expected it to improve, but instead, it was much worse....so much worse.  From on the ON position, it took a whopping 5 seconds to prime the first shot.  After firing, it took another 10 seconds to prime the next shot.  After that, it took a crazy 15 seconds to even get it to ready for the next shot.  It held at 15 seconds until it went flat after the 10 total shots.  10 shots.... 10.....Do yourself a favor and just buy better batteries.... These are basically worthless for flashes.

  I bought two sets for my Digital SLR camera.  One for the camera and one for the flash.  The first time I used them I didn't need the flash so I didn't even open that set.

Packed them up, took them to my destination, put them in the camera, the camera turned on literally only long enough for me to program in the month and the day, not even the year.  I'd say less than 60 seconds.  So I plugged them in to charge again.  Both times waiting for a complete charge - nothing.  I thought at first it could be a problem with my camera.  But then I bought some rechargeable NiMh AAs to try and the camera and batteries worked fine.  These batteries SEEMED like a good idea, I liked that they could be charged by usb, but in the end a complete waste of money unfortunately.I wrote to the company asking if they warranty these or would offer a replacement - no response.

  Searching for a 3.5 volt USB rechargeable AA battery for my LED flashlight.  I know the high end flashlight brands that have their own 14500 batteries but thought I'd try these.  They do work even on ""high"" or ""turbo"" setting.  Did not have any luck with the Blackube 1700mAH grey colored batteries.  On high or turbo the light shuts off and I tried them in several flashlights.  So I'm tempted to believe the battery shut off due to excessive drain.  It's odd these 1500mAH batteries work.

  This review is for the High Output Li-ion 1.5 volt/1700mAH battery.  The gray ones.

My light is a small Utorch ""UT01"" and works well with the Fenix ARB-L14-1600IU usb rechargeable cell.  But this Blackube 1700mAH shuts off when I attempt the turbo mode.  Works with all other output settings even strobe and SOS but not Turbo.  I must admit the four output USB charging cable is worth the purchase alone.UPDATE:  So I installed these 1700mAH batteries to my Delta kitchen faucet with ""motion sensors"".  It takes six Alkaline batteries but I don't like throwing away all those Alkaline batteries.  So far these Blackube 1700mAH batteries are working properly.  I'd also suspect they will work in door locks that have small motors.  I did try these Blackube batteries in a couple other LED flashlights and observed the same behavior.

Good 1.5V batteries for voltage picky devices
","

  I have been wanting to get something like these for a while and they work great for my use case. You may ask, why would anyone pay $10 for a single AA cell? Why wouldn't you just get a cheaper NiMH cell and call it a day? The answer to this is simple: There are devices I own that are just not designed to operate at lower voltages. When I go on business trips, two things really matter to me -- my portable water flosser and my wireless mouse for my laptop. Problem with NiMH is that while it is fully charged at 1.5V, their voltages quickly drop down to the 1.25-1.3V range soon after they are being used or have been sitting around for a while. This means a much weaker pressure on my water flosser and a choppy Bluetooth connection for my wireless mouse. Charging my NiMHs every so often has gotten to be such a chore that I have decided I would pay up for these cells instead which can keep a consistent voltage over time.Although the concept of lithium-ion USB AA cells is not new (there are plenty out of products out there), this is one of the highest rated capacities that can be found on Amazon. All of these cells work by enclosing a lithium-based battery inside an AA enclosure and using a small chip built into the + terminal of the battery to convert and regulate the output voltage. The circuit also regulates charging and the discharging of the built-in lithium battery to prevent over(dis)charging.Here are my thoughts on these batteries:Style/Design: These look exactly like your traditional AA batteries, with the exception that there is a built-in micro USB port on top of each battery (as opposed to other designs that have this on the side). The battery seems sturdy and in one piece. It does not appear that it would suffer from the drop issue that other designs face with the circuitry falling off when dropped. There is also a charging indicator light that turns red when the battery is being charged and turns off when the charging is complete. The enclosed 4-in-1 cable is quite handy so you can simply use one cable to charge 4 batteries at once without having to use a USB hub or 4 separate cables.Weight: Since lithium-based batteries have higher energy densities, the battery is significantly lighter when compared to a 2,400mAh LSD NiMH. One of these cells weighed 20g while the NiMH based cell weighed 29g.Voltage Stability Under Load: When the batteries are not subject to a load, they measure around 1.51-1.53V. When placed under load, the voltage drops are as follows:250mA: 1.46V500mA: 1.41V750mA: 1.38V1A: 1.34V1.25A: 1.30V1.5A: 1.24V1.75A: 1.22V2A: 1.20V2.15A: 1.18VBeyond ~2.2A, the current limiter kicks in and no further increase in current is possible, even in the case of a short circuit. When measured with a multimeter under a short-circuit condition, the maximum acquired current was 2.21A. I am not quite sure how the manufacturer was able to achieve 4A of current on these cells, but it is possible that they were testing a set of 2 batteries being operated in parallel.Compared to an LSD NiMH cell, voltage drops on these batteries are steeper in the short term, however, these cells can provide approximately the same voltage until the whole cell is depleted (i.e. until the under-voltage protection IC kicks in for the lithium cell).Discharging Test: A discharge test was done for these batteries under 2A, 1A, 500mA, and 250mA conditions. The results are as follows:2A: Runtime: 44m 35s - Capacity: 1,485mAh (87.35%) - Power: 1,904mWh (74.67%)1A: Runtime: 1h 34m 20s - Capacity: 1,573mAh (92.53%) - Power: 2,210mWh (86.67%)500mA: Runtime: 3h 15m 28s - Capacity: 1,615mAh (95%) - Power: 2,362mWh (92.63%)250mA: Runtime: 6h 22m 45s - Capacity: 1,584mAh (89.49%) - Power: 2,216mWh (86.90%)It seems like the converter was the most efficient when the current draw was around 500mA when both the capacity and the power ratings have a 90+% match compared to the numbers on the label. The voltage was fairly consistent through all the current tests and does not ""curve"" downward like traditional batteries as they are being discharged. Instead, the battery experiences an abrupt drop to zero voltage when the cell is depleted (shut off due to the under-voltage protection IC kicking in for the built-in lithium cell battery). Because the voltage stays constant throughout the whole discharge cycle, it is not possible to gauge battery capacity based on the terminal voltage (it will always read around 1.51-1.53V when measured without load, or 0V when depleted).Charging Test: Charging these batteries using my battery pack, which outputs a USB voltage of around 5.3V, the charging process took 1h 55m. This was quite on point with quoted 2h timeframe from the manufacturer (the charging time may be closer to 2h exactly for USB power sources that are lower than 5.3V, although the difference would most likely be nominal). The charging process was split into two phases, a constant-current phase which drew a constant current of about 0.42A, and a constant-voltage phase as the lithium cell becomes full. The constant-current phase lasted 1h and 30m and the constant-voltage phase continued for another 22m until the current was cut off once the USB charging current reached 50mA (the charging light turns off at this point).When charging 4 batteries at once using the same cable, the current may approach 1.7A during the constant-current phase. This may cause some problems when charging from the computer USB's port since even the USB 3.0 spec only allows up to 900mA of current for unconfigured devices (newer DCP ports allow 1.5A of current). To avoid overcurrent issues, it is best to charge all 4 batteries using a charger that has at least 2A of available power.Ripple Test: Since the battery uses a converter chip to convert the internal voltage from the nominal voltage of 3.7V down to 1.5V, it impacts a ripple ""fluctuating"" voltage on the battery output terminals. When the battery was not under any load, the ripple was 12.17Hz @ 27.60mV Vpp (most likely in power saving PFM mode). Putting the battery across a 5Ω resistor (~300mA current) resulted in a different ripple pattern that was of higher frequency that was 1.023Mhz @ 12.60mV Vpp. This level of ripple is low and should not be problematic for devices running on these batteries.Shelf-Life: Since this battery relies on a converter chip that is always-on, it will use a minuscule amount of power to perform this conversion even when no load is attached. Assuming the chip draws about 25µA of power when there is no current load, the battery should last about 3 years before it is fully depleted. This should not be a problem if the batteries are actively being used and recharged, although letting the batteries sit idle without being charged for 3 or more years may result in irreversible cell damage (I assume that's why the manufacturer stated that the service life is 3 years). Devices that draw a small ghost load may kick the battery out of the power saving mode and lead to faster energy depletion. That being said, the cell will most likely run out of energy due to this load much quicker than this quiescent load.Overall, these batteries are great. Although they are much more expensive than other batteries out there, they serve my purposes quite well and I am very happy with them. For high current applications though, using NiMH cells may be more appropriate since they have higher energy overall, cheaper, and can easily tolerate 5A or more of current.

  Considering that you are paying about the same for 4 batteries as you are for a 100 pack of AA alkaline cells, there needs to mitigation to justify the expenditure. I use these for my Apple wireless keyboard and trackpad. They are always ready to switch out and perform well  for low-drain applications. My guess is that high-drain application such as a flashlight might not work well. For me it is the convenience and need to not dispose of multiple spent batteries into landfills.

***These batteries do not hold a charge as long as they claim to ***
","

  I am giving these batteries 1 Star because they DO NOT do what they claim. If it were just one, then maybe. But all four do not live up to the claims of hourly usage. Not only that, but if used in a gaming controller, the batteries do give you 100% output until they just die out, without warning. They do not last nearly as long as they claim to, so, if using in a gaming controller, you may as well use NI-MH batteries that seem to have the same amount life from charge to discharge, plus the added bonus of slowly losing charge, so you are not left out there.

  I'm hoping that these will have a more steady discharge curve than typical alkaline rechargeables. And also no memory effect. If they made a cell that would have 2500mAH I would have preferred those, but these seem the best choice from what I could find. The packaging is well done, there was a case for the batteries and the charging cable seems sturdy. Fortunately, these have a BMS to handle nearly any charger that is close to specification.

  These are great for flashlights, remote controls, Blink Cameras etc. However if installed in an AM/FM radio the AM band will not work. I tried 3 different radios. These batteries have an internal DC-DC buck converter which drops the Li Ion 3.7VDC to 1.5 VDC. The converter uses a high frequency signal which generates EMI & overloads the AM receiver front end. FM works fine since it is less susceptible to noise.

  Purchase price: $23.25 with applied promotion (4 AA batteries total)Seller: BlackubePurchase date: October 2018Before making the purchase, I checked and this was the one with the legitimate best reviews.  It also had the matching premium price.If you have a battery operated device you use every day that can use these, then these are the ones to get.  Everything about them is decent quality or better right down to the box they come in.  The band for the wires is even worth keeping.  There are some small improvements that I will recommend, however.The plastic box that the batteries come in could be made with space for the wires so that one could no longer need the cardboard box.  This way if someone was to travel they would have a pretty good case to keep everything together neat and compact.  Also the elderly and those that are fine motor skills impaired with their hands may benefit from a charging option that uses more gross motor skills.  By no means am I saying to get rid of the wire option, just something for the manufacturer to think about as an additional option or potential accessory.That's it, if I have any issues and I remember this review then hopefully I will update.

Having Li-Ion AAA size batteries available is a great option for many uses better than NiMh or NiCd
","

  So far these are performing as expected.  I enjoy the convenience of USB charging with no additional equipment required to bring like NiCd and NiMh technologies.  You can charge at home, travel, car, camping (with solar USB options)There are two main advantages to these cells if you need AAA rechargeable.- very low self-discharge rate so using them long term in clocks or remote controls where you have low power use over a long time.  These perform very well.  Because of the low self-discharge, it also stores well and only needs recharging 6-12 months later.  Other technologies would be long dead by then.- constant 1.5v for equipment that does not run well on the 1.2v rechargeable cells.the things to be aware of- they die suddenly without the normal dimming of regular cells.  not a bid deal in many situations but not great for other situations where you need warning- lower rated capacity than non-rechargeable and NiCd or NiMh cells.  Because of the low self-discharge rate of these cells, they will still beat other rechargeable cells because other cells lose charge that you can't use due to self-discharge- no rechargeable cell will beat a non-rechargeable cell.  don't set that expectation.I wanted to buy more of these but the seller had a 1 per order limit.

  recently we got the chance to test out the blackube 2550 mWh AA usb rechargable Li-ion batteries, even though we havent gotten a chance to run all the tests i must say im already in love with them. first and foremost the number one thing that really sold me on this product was the micro usb port for recahrge! this makes all the difference in the world for me, not haveing to carry the special spring loaded clip charges or worry about loseing it or a wall outlet has made this a joy to bring out in the field to fly rc. its a common cord we almost all have and more places then not to plug a full size usb in these days then a wall outlet for most of us. ok lets talk charge speed and battery life, as far as charge speed they seem to average at 87% faster then two different sets of 1770mAh AA that we ran them with!!! this is a huge increase in speed especially sense they where put next to a much smaller mAh. now as far as used lifespan we are still running a few more tests and will post again when they are done. that being said the results that have been gathered are very promising, a single AA in a minimed medtronic diabetic pump is currently running at 45% remain after 15 days of use!!!! this is often paired with a stomach censor increaseing the draw. normally its every few days to two weeks max before its time for a new one or a recharge. this looks like it will come closer to once a month :) secondly we tried these with a few rc transmitters putting them in at full then after 8 hours use pulled them to check V. this was done on a Dxe Dx8, afer the dxe day we still had 93% after the dx8 day we had 87% makeing them about even sense the dx8 has a display screen that its also powering. although i still want to finish and run a couple tests i can say after two weeks of use these have quickly become my favorite and new go to for AA batteries. between use in rotary tools, lights, air pumps and everything else this has saved some headake in the struggle to keep all our devices powered and last.big thank you to blackube for sending these to us to test out, as a company i personally have not had one complaint in dealing with them, always a quick and friendly response, nice to see these days :)

  I like how easy these are to charge, but they take a long time to top off and don’t have the greatest capacity.

  Got these primarily to use with my favorite three-mode, zoom, AAA flashlight.  Unfortunately, the light doesn't function with these Blackubes.  Light works well with NiMH (EBL) rechargeable as well as with Li-Ion (Energizer) non-rechargeables, but flashes for a split second and dies on Blackubes.Most devices are designed to operate at 1.5V and these Blackubes are 1.5V.  The alternative rechargeable is NiMH 1.2V, 25% less than Li-Ion and Alkaline.  But voltage is only half the story, Ampacity (or Amp-capacity) is the other half.  The power (energy) of a battery is Volts x Amps.  Most devices operate in a band of voltage (e.g. 0.9V -- 1.7V), so a battery that starts at 1.5 might be expected to operate better over it's wider usable voltage range?Energy calculated from published specs:  Volts  AmpHr  Energy  Diameter  1.5V  0.6 Ahr  0.9 Whr  0.399""  Blackube AAA  - *Failed to light flashlight  1.2V  1.2 Ahr  1.4 Whr  0.403""  EBL AAA  1.5V  1.2 Ahr  1.8 Whr  0.405""  Energizer Ult AAABut this chart doesn't tell the whole story.  First, Blackube fails to light the flashlight, so it's useless.  But, let's assume Blackube fixes their battery and someday functions properly?  It's still low on the energy chart.  Better voltage, but worse Ampacity.  Knew this going in, but wanted to test the spec'd better voltage range to see whether those extra 0.3V at the top added more operating headroom?There are also advantages to charging from a standard USB.  EBL NiMH require a charging station, weighing several ounces.  Blackube requires only a few-gram standard USB cable.  This alone could make Blackube worth carrying - if they lit the flashlight?It should be noted the flashlight operates at 70mA on the other two battery's, regardless input voltage (above 0.9V).  There is an unused high-mode at 150 mA and an unused flashing mode at 70mA (which surely pulses 150 mA at 50% duty-cycle).  Blackube failed in these unused modes as well.

Very convenient. Be careful not to lose the caps.
","

  USB ports are everywhere and always easy to find which is what makes these so convenient. No need to carry a seperate charger. The red light on the battery turns to green when fully charged which takes all the guess work out of it. They seen to hold a good capacity charge and recharge quickly.  The magnetic caps are helpful, but my concern is they can easily be lost. Not much holding them onto the battery when being stored or in use, and only a weak magnet holding them to the battery when being charged. If your careful about this,  these batteries are great and I intend to order more.

  I've only had them for a few days and already they have disappointed. The good: they're nice looking batteries and come with a handy 4-prong USB charging cord. The bad: after charging them, they (a) failed to power up a camera that works fine on regular AAs and (b) overheated in an LED flashlight. Right now they are hot and bulging - seem hazardous although maybe this is normal somehow? Anyway, I won't be buying these again.

  I just received these batteries last week.  I have been using them in a VR Controller for my Samsung Odyssey.  The controllers use a lot of battery power.  An Alkaline battery will not last more than five or six hours.  I bought Lithium batteries which last a whole lot longer, but are very expensive.  Giving these a try and so far they have held up pretty good.  They charge very, very fast.  They seem like great technology.Update....I have not had to change the batteries yet in my VR controllers.  After about 40 hours of use in my Xbox controllers, I needed to recharge.  That is incredible.  Wish I had more money, I would buy more of these batteries.  They are great!

Good performance except for capacity
","

  I purchased a set of 4 AA cells for use in wireless mics. Wanting to know how long a charge would last, I constructed a test fixture with a 15 ohm load (100 mA at 1.5 V). Although the specified capacity of these cells is 1,250 mAh, they only produced 657, 1,054, 1,100 and 1,112 mAh. These results are repeatable and sub-par. Might this be an indicator of other quality deficiencies? Other than capacity the cells performed well, maintaining a constant 1.5 V output until they drop abruptly to 0 V when depleted. This being the case, the device they power will not give a low battery warning - it will just stop working. These units incorporate a rechargeable lithium cell, recharging circuit and output voltage regulator within the profile of a AA package. The voltage regulator apparently cuts out if overloaded, preventing damage to the lithium cell. The series regulator inherently produces heat proportional to load current, explaining why some users reported heating. Unfortunately, maximum load current is not specified. I like the design because it provides the full 1.5 V required to operate my wireless mics and would probably give it 5 stars if they met their specified capacity.

  They seem to be holding their own in a Tascam DR-40 PCM recorder. I can even phantom power a condenser mic for a little while.

  I used these batteries for my game cameras because regular alkaline batteries just would not last especially in the colder temps alkaline loose 50% of their capacity. These batteries have been in the cameras for three weeks now and are still showing 99% on the cameras charge meter reader. I will let you know a follow up as time goes on but the cameras that have regular batteries in them are down to 62% in the same time frame. I have four cameras. Two with regular batteries and two with these lithium rechargeables. So far I’m impressed. Expense was my only concern but I did the math and after the initial investment I will be saving hundreds over a years time of operating these cameras.

  I had a good experience with AA batteries rechargeable on USB so decided to try these AAA batteries.  They look well-made and recharge just fine using a USB port.  However, they were not dependable when used on two different devices.  When three of them were installed in a motion detecting night light, the light worked well initially but soon began to strobe or flicker even when no motion was detected.  This would quickly discharge the batteries, although they could then be recharged to a full charge as shown by a battery tester.  I recharged and tested all the batteries and found one that was defective.  I put three good batteries back in the nightlight but got the same strobe effect.  I recharged the batteries and put two of them in a small LED flashlight.  The flashlight worked well but then became noticeably warm.  The flashlight then popped and died.  I examined the flashlight but found no evidence of damage.  I put in two alkaline batteries and the flashlight worked well.  These AAA batteries are listed as working in a flashlight but there might be a quirk in the battery chip.  I have ordered a set of Eneloop AAA batteries, which have worked well for me in the past.

  My roku remote was using the cheap free batteries I got when I bought something from the HF stores and basicAAA cells just did not last long. I got tired of changing batteries once a week. I wanted to try these lithium ionrechargeables.  What a big difference, the first set has lasted over a month of high use and are still going. You get four with a combine four charging cord. Charged two, about 2 hours and the red light went  off on the battery. Justplugged into my usb port on my computer. The other two are on standby in the plastic case provided. I am happy I got these.

  DANGEROUS -- DO NOT BUYThese do not charge on a normal 1.5 volt charger; at least, they are simply not recognized by a Maha quick/soft charger.These will charge on a lithium-capable intelligent charger.  On a Nitecore branded smart charger the appear to charge in the 4 +/- volt range.  However, they do not hold a charge worth bothering with.  They are quickly drained in any application I've tried -- electric toothbrush, electric ear trimmer, flashlight -- never lasting more than about 5 minutes of run time.These appear to charge on a micro-usb charger; however, BEWARE!The first battery I put on a micro-usb charged from dead flat for a couple hours.  When I checked it the LED was still solid red, indicating it was charging; however, the battery was extremely hot and after taking it off and letting it cool down I noticed the battery had swollen and was deformed along one side.  Note this deformation in the uploaded picture.The second battery I tried charging with micro-usb (not having learned my lesson apparently) was also from dead flat.  After less than 10 minutes the battery began to SMOKE!  Smoke poured out the micro-usb port until I was able to disconnect it, burning myself in the process.THIS PRODUCT IS DANGEROUS!  I post this as public service message.  Seller and manufacturer -- do not bother contacting me, I will not take this review down as this product presents a danger to the public.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS PRODUCT, AND DISCONTINUING USE IF YOU ALREADY OWN.

The batteries should be tested for voltage before installing in electronics.
","

  I purchased this product and the original order showed that it was ready to ship and stayed that way until it showed lost after 10 days.  I went through the process to get a refund and ended up having to chat with an Amazon customer rep that issued a refund.  I reordered and received the next order in the promised time. I am writing this review for the AAA set of batteries.  I ordered 4 because that's how many i needed.  When I installed them in my device it would not power on.  My next step was to charge them.  So I got out my volt meter to be on the safe side to check voltage to see why they needed charging.  I tested the voltage and 3 of the 4 tested at just over 1.5 volts.  The problem was the 4th battery that tested at just over 4 volts.  The batteries didn't need charging at all.  I have 1 battery that was not quality checked before it left the factory and was dangerously over voltage for an AAA battery.  The batteries charge well so far.  Because of the lack of in house quality control, I can not give this product more than 3 stars.  I will update this review once I have contacted the seller and try to resolve the 4th battery.  I also purchased at the same time the AA batteries and will test and review them soon.Update:  I have changed the rating from 3 to 4 stars.  I am in the process of monitoring these batteries.  In my original review, one of the 4 batteries was over voltage.  I charged it one cycle, retested it fresh off the charge and it was still over voltage at 4.03 volts.  I decided to let it rest for 2 hours to stabilize after charging and retested it.  To my amazement, it tested 1.533 volts.  I installed it with the other 3 in my appliance and it worked fine.  I will continue to monitor these regularly to insure that they remain in specs.  I am testing the idea that in some instances, the internal circuit that monitors and charges needs a cooling down period to switch from 3.7 lithium volts before it bucks down to 1.5 volts.  I will update with my results after a few days have passed.

  I rate these with five stars because they are a super nifty upgrade to most devices that require 1.5, 3.0, or 4.5 volts in 1, 2, or 3 series boxes.  Ni-Cad 1.2 volt cells have been disappointing me for years now and it is worth five stars to finally have a rechargeable 1.5 volt cell with depth. The only downside is that my old TV Listener wireless headphones don't like them. In this antique application they cause an unacceptable amount of RF interference.

  Bought these for my boss who loves to visit inhospitable places across the planet and hates to bring a charger. These batteries do everything themselves - you plug them into a USB outlet and they refill inside of some 90 minutes. One outlet will charge all four of them and they neatly indicate that they are still charging with a fierce red light and will then go dark once full.You have to charge them via the USB - the LiPo charger will not understand how to charge them and perhaps even damage them. They charge quite linearly. You can do half full in some 40 minutes.The energy content is not great and the seller also makes no such claims. They hold .4Ah over 1..5V, some 2100 joules.They do self-discharge rather swiftly, so the ""pre-charged"" claim will be 80% untrue by the time you get them.They are hence best suitable for heavy use on the go or for constant use. Don't use them to save battery cost on your Bose headset unless you use it all the time.The light indicator is really neat. It's so bright you can operate the batteries in complete darkness, outdoors or aboard a plane. They have good low tolerances and are all quite equal in charge time and capacity. And the fact that they can be fed via an ordinary micro-USB cable is a great feature.

Works great but needs recharging fairly often
","

  Background: I frequently make international business trips lasting many weeks or months and carrying lots of batteries for my collection of electronics is inconvenient.Pros. These batteries fit and work perfectly in devices needing AAA batteries. They only need a standard micro-USB cable to charge. A cable that can charge 4 batteries at once was included. Charging time is fairly short, seems to be less than 2 hours.Cons: A trade-off for the built in charging port on the battery is that there is less room in the battery case for actual Li polymer so they do not have a lot of capacity. In my experience they only last about 20-25% as long as an alkaline battery would last in the same application.Verdict: For my situation and uses they are fine and I am glad I bought them. If you have electronic devices that require lots of power they may not have a long enough use time to satisfy you.

  This battery has a capacity of 400 milliAmp hours.  A typical AAA alkaline battery has capacity 800 to 1200 mAh, double to triple.

This is very disappointing for such expensive batteries.

  Running a quick test of 3 AAA cells in my LED flashlight, they died after 25 minutes on high. They were quite warm. The stated capacity is 400mAh but I didn't try to measure it. Embossed on the side of the flashlight it indicated that it could run at full brightness for 4 hours with unstated AAAs. Quick web search shows 1000 mAh at 10 mA discharge. Since I didn't measure the discharge rate when in my flashlight the comparison is not very valid. Nonetheless, giving up room in the battery for the USB micro and related charging circuitry, it isn't surprising that the performance is so low.

  The batteries are a great convenient design and the included cable to charge all 4 at once is a great inclusion. Their capacity is not as high as non-rechareable but are great for things like flashlights or game controllers.They also come with a nice little storage box which is great for keeping a handful charged to quickly swap out. Charging only took maximum of 2 hours. They do not come charged. Due to their cost vs non-rechargeable and their lower charge density it looks like recharging about 16 times would equal the cost of a 32 pack at costco. But also consider the amount of waste from throwing batteries out. Rated for 1000 cycles means they should pay for themselves many times over.I purchased 3 packs and only 1 battery was bad out of a total of 12.HITRENDS had excellent customer service and gave a partial refund which I thought was better than dealing dealing with shipping a whole pack back when 3 worked perfectly fine.

The batteries were supposed to be already charged it said on the box, but they were all dead when I got them.

  The micro-USB cable is more suitable for out-of-town charging than other rechargeable batteries. Using this cable to charge multiple devices at the same time can be recycled. It is still the focus of my attention. So far, they are running well and working hours are new.  The non-rechargeable battery is almost the same and can be fully charged in a few hours. The rechargeable battery greatly extends the life of the battery. Most of my batteries can be recharged now, which can reduce costs and reduce pollution. It is strongly recommended to use rechargeable batteries.

  Works exactly as advertised... comes with a charging cable that allows you to charge all four batteries at once from one usb output. Very convenient.

  As with many rechargeable batteries the 800 mWh is important here, a typical AA stores 2200 mWh so the batteries are not going to last long in things like a flashlight but they are great for remote controls or other low power use devices.The reason to get these is that you don't need a special charger for them.

  Problem #1: The USB port at the top is shorter than standard length (see picture) so they don't work in some devices, including my computer. They won't go into any port where the plastic/covering is too thick.Problem #2: These things seem to have terrible standby life. Not sure if it's just my mouse, but whenever I leave these things uncharged for more than a day or two, they seem to go dead (or at least not have enough charge to make my mouse work) meaning I've resorted to leaving one plugged in at all times and swapping.The overall battery life is ok, I get a few weeks on a charge in my G602 mouse. I'd recommend getting a USB dock (as pictured) to charge these things, as that works perfectly, and one with a switch will let you turn the charging current on and off. The included LEDs light up when charging, and the battery caps have magnets, so they're pretty easy to attach to the USB port on top. Overall, if they fit in your USB charger, they're very convenient, but I'm not sure I'd recommend them over some ordinary rechargeables (or just ol' reliable AA's).

Short USB plug makes charging a challenge
","

  The USB plug on the batteries, used for charging, are shorter than most standard plugs.  I found that they work in some chargers, but not others, or sometimes they just barely work if you wiggle them just right.  However, I would be very concerned about charging them in a charger where they just barely make connection, because if the contact area is very small, it could overheat due to the amount of current passing through it.  For that reason, I'd caution against charging them in a laptop (wall chargers are much cheaper to replace), and try to find a charger that seems to provide a good, solid connection.

Works for video game controllers or remotes fairly well

  I have a couple video game setups in my house and love to play when I get a chance. Something that I have gotten a bit more cognizant of, as I age, is the environment and also my budget. I seriously love when I can help the environment a bit while also saving myself from having to dish out any money and these two batteries have helped quite a bit. I have used these in my Xbox One controller and they work very well. The only pain is if you have only one set, you have to wait for them to recharge but they do so fairly quickly. They are solid to use in a pinch for a gaming controller (better if you have 2 sets so you can always have one charged/topped off) but they are especially good in remote controls for the TV or whatever requires AA batteries. I think that these have found their ""forever home"" in a Sharp TV remote as I hopefully shouldn't have to purchase another set for that again. The battery life was fairly good for my Xbox controller but it has proven great for lower drain devices (E.g. Remotes). I would highly recommend getting these for lower battery drain scenarios instead and only using with controllers in a pinch.Pros:Works well with remotesHelps the environmentSaves money on buying non-rechargeable batteriesSimple/easy to chargeNeutral:Works solid in Xbox controller but takes a while to charge (so get another set if you plan on this being the main use for these)Cons:These last a long time in remotes and low drain devices but don't last as long as the really good non-rechargeables in higher drain devices (controllers, cameras)Overall, these are a solid value and I would recommend checking them out if you are in the market.

  This is a set of 4 rechargeable batteries that can be recharged by USB. The batteries are the standard size and shape of AA batteries. But on their ends, they have USB micro ports. To charge them, just us a USB A to USB micro charging cable to plug the batteries into a USB charging source (transformer not included). You can also charge the batteries in a standard AA battery charger, which can be handy for charging more than one at a time.I find these batteries work just as well as my other rechargeable batteries, and they are comparable in performance to regular non-rechargeable AA batteries. The USB charging feature is really slick, since you can recharge these batteries anywhere you go so long as you have a standard phone charge with a micro USB cable.

  Nice Idea, just a bad application of it.  When at full charge these are not the same as a regular battery and will not even work in several things we have tried.  They only work with low draw items... like a wall clock.  Which, is pretty pointless; you want rechargeable batteries for items that burn through batteries quickly; and, so far, I have found that these do not work with any of them.  Then, when you do use it on a low draw item and need to charge it again, it takes over a day to get a full charge back!  And, lastly, if you used all four in one item, you only have 1 charger which is not going to cut it.

These ANVOW AA USB rechargeable batteries really are 1.5 volts, unlike a lot of others

  These AA batteries have their own USB port on the top of battery so it eliminates the use of a cable to charge them, so you can just plug them into the side of your laptop/desktop or into anything that has a USB port (I used my Phones wall plug in). Which makes the need for a separate battery Charger unnecessary.The other thing I like about these ANVOW AA Batteries is that they really are 1.5 Volts (see pic on tester) unlike most of the Rechargeable batteries as most are only 1.2 volts...(see pic of Duracell AA Rechargeable battery on my tester).  This is a REALLY BIG DEAL for me since my Digital camera will not operate on 2.4 Volts (two 1.2 V AA's) and buying throw away batteries are expensive...but it powers right up and last for ever literally with these ANVOW AA's in it.  I also noted that they make my Mini Flashlight a lot brighter than the 1.2 V rechargeable ones do.Convenience, More Power, Fast Charging and at a really good price...whats not to Love.......gets some, you'll be glad you did.

  These batteries take about 1.5 hours to fully charge at 5V (the red light goes from flashing to steady), and last almost exactly 3 hours in my little one-cell LED flashlight.Given the short charge life, these obviously won't replace disposable ""real"" batteries, or even the rechargables that need a charger.

  Already, in only a few days of use, one of them shows fully charged on the USB (sustained red light), but shows only .5V (point five) volts on the voltmeter.  Another one will not light up on the USB at all; apparently it is shorted and shows near-zero volts and will not take a charge.  Unreliable.While the design idea is brilliant -- to be able to pull off the top plastic cap and stick them into a USB slot for recharging (including solar recharging) -- the performance has been uneven and unpredictable with these.  They came in showing a very good charge right out of the package; oddly, the highest I have ever seen from rechargeables.  I'm still testing, but would alert buyers to the potential for radio interference (EMF), for some odd reason.  It has been particularly noticeable with a.m. radio.  They seem possibly okay for other non-audio and light-use purposes, such as a nose trimmer or small flashlight or clock, though the power drain has been unpredictable or sudden.  I will update as necessary after further use.

  These lithium AA's are really a mixed bag. While it is ""convenient"" to be able to charge them with a USB without the need for an actual battery charger; they are also inconvenient to charge when you need to charge all 4.The capacity is also very low for a rechargeable AA at only 1200mah.I charged these batteries for 12+ hours (the lights on them never seem to turn off even when they are charged) and when I put them into a remote control car; they only lasted around 20 minutes before the car was low on battery.Overall this is a disappointing turnout as my conventional rechargeable last for 1.5 hours.The other issue is with charging all 4 batteries at once; you need 4 wall chargers or one charger with 4 ports to use to charge.I think I will end up using them for wall clocks or something where the power draw is low and I rarely will have to charge them (or so I hope).If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful!

Not Quite Up To Specs
","

  When it comes to physics, you don't get something for nothing. This has always been the case with rechargeable batteries which have tried to replace standard alkaline batteries. While companies have tried in the past to make rechargeable batteries that were the same size as AA alkaline batteries, there is always some kind of compromise. With older Ni-Cad rechargeable batteries the voltage was always far less than 1.5 Volts, the amount of time they lasted was always shorter and they would only recharge a few dozen times before they had to be thrown away.These new rechargeable batteries  use Lithium as their storage medium and while they do last far longer than their Ni-Cad counterparts, they still have a problem with not delivering the minimum 1.5 Volts that Alkaline batteries do. To be sure, they are much better than Ni-Cads, but the highest voltage that I could charge these batteries to was about 1.45 Volts. Although AA Alkaline batteries state that they run 1.5 Volts, the average AA battery produces around 1.64 Volts when they are brand new.While these voltage numbers do not sound like a huge difference, some very sensitive electronics are not ""fooled"" by the lower voltages and will not work correctly, if at all. If you are using batteries to run something very simple like a motor or a flashlight you will likely not notice any difference in performance other than that the motor may run slightly slower or the light may shine a little less brighter. If you are using these batteries to run something like a GPS receiver or a medical device the problem could be a bit more serious though.While these batteries come much, much closer to replacing disposable alkaline batteries than ever before, the technology is still not 100% there. For many simple devices these batteries are perfectly acceptable though.

  My wife and I try to do our part for the environment. I found these and ordered them immediately. The pack of 4 come in a storage case, and are easily charged for use. Just take off the cap and plug into a USB port, when the red blinking LED indicator stop, it is ready. Put the cap back on and use in any device that uses AA batteries. I have been using them in a RC car to really put a drain on them and after 4 days of use, they finally needed a recharge. They last about the same and even a little longer than the top brand of Alkaline batteries. Now, I just recharge them, and use them again. No batteries going to the landfill today. These are rated for 1000 cycles. This 4 pack could ultimately replace 4000 AA alkaline batteries. That is a ton of money saved. Most of all, it is a ton of batteries not going in the trash and poisoning the earth. The batteries are very safe to use as they have built in protection circuitry for overcharging and discharging. They also have very important approvals by the FCC CE & RoHS. These are great batteries and we will be stocking up on these from now on. These are the best value when calculating how many batteries these will replace and the costs. I give these 5 stars for helping to save Mother Nature.

These are SUCH a GREAT IDEA!!!!!!

  This has been a bad year for batteries for me. I've spent so much money on batteries only to have an appliance die a few weeks after installing the new batteries. I have a clock that powered through 6 batteries in 2 months. It may be the fault of the appliance or the battery, I'm not sure which but it's so frustrating.These solve allll of that! I just recharge them and pop them back into whatever device needs batteries. They charge super quickly, last a long time on one charge, have an indicator light telling you when they are charged, and they pay for themselves very quickly. I'm 100% satisfied with these!(I got a four pack. Any standard USB charger will charge these.)

Quick to charge/Clear indication when fully charged/Excellent life off a full charge
","

  While I only have two batteries in my included photo, I was sent a total of 4 of these to review.Charge time is very quick on this batteries.There are clear light indications which let you know what stage in the charge process you're in. A red light blinks when each battery is charging; the red light turns solid when the charge cycle is complete; the red light turns off after a few minutes of a full charge being reached.Since charging these, I've had two in one of my gaming controls. I've since used that control at least 20 hours and my gaming indicator still shows more than enough life in the batteries. In short, these have very good battery life.At the price these are listed at and how they perform, I consider them to be a very strong value and I highly recommend them. In fact, I will be buying more of these outside of my review.Recommended5 starsCheers!

Practical rechargeable batteries

  No need to keep track of a battery charger when you use these batteries. Instead they come open and plug directly into a USB charger. They remind me quite a bit of USB thumb drives. The only downside is that you need a lot of powered USB plugs if you want to charge all four. Since the batteries are a bit thicker than a USB cord, you can't plug them into ports next to each other on a multi-port plug (at least not the one I use). I did them in shifts of 2 batteries at a time, and they seemed to charge up in about an hour.The batteries so far have lasted well for me. I used them in my wireless mouse for this week and haven't had the batteries die. If I notice them draining more quickly than normal, I'll update my review.The batteries come with a carrying case, which helps me not lose them. I'm excited to use these in remotes and other places where I need AA batteries.

  I have been converting to rechargeable batteries so that I no longer need to use disposable batteries. I like that it can be plugged into a port for charging them up. It is also nice that they flash red until they are fully charged and then turn a steady red, so I know at a glance when they are done charging. It is interesting that there is a cap that slips over the charging tab, so that it is converted into a fully functional battery. I have purchased another brand that also includes a plug that allows you to have up to four batteries attached to it, allowing you to only have to use one port to charge up four batteries at a time. It would have been nice if this brand also had that feature.

  First I was supposed to get 4 AA & 4 AAA but got 8 AA. After charging for 8 hours 1 wouldn't hold charge at all. I wouldn't recommend using in items with continuous use (ei. lights, radio, toys) for they do not last long between charge. Maybe fine for remote controls or a mouse something with very little drain.

Quickly loses charge
","

  Update:  I originally had a two star review, but the seller reached out to me and sent replacement batteries.  The replacements are working fine.  I use strictly for my Xbox one controllers.  Before re-reviewing, I charged all 4 batteries.  I then used 2 of them and they lasted about as long as a normal generic battery (around 20 hours).  I used a different set of batteries for the rest of the week, as I wanted to see if the others held a charge.  Upon placing the batteries back into the controller after a week of sitting around, I saw only a small degradation this time around (batteries didn't last quite as long, about 16 hours).  This batch out performed the initial batteries I received.  This review takes the following into account:The price of the batteries vs. the performance of the product. (I equate these to a set of how a generic battery would perform since it is over half the price of other USB batteries out there).Charge seemed to retain longer than the previous set that was sent.The charging time was my mistake.  These state that it should take about 4 hours to charge, so that is the norm for these batteries.The superb customer service I received.  I was contacted immediately about my initial score, and they asked to send replacement batteries to test (on their dime).  They initially sent the incorrect battery (AAA vs. AA).  I told them they sent the wrong battery and they quickly shipped out a replacement AA set.Used for my Xbox One controller.Pros:PriceIf charging batteries and using right away, they seem to work about as long as regular generic batteries.Con: If charging the batteries and storing for later use, the charge degrades within approximately one week, and will have to be recharged.The time to charge the batteries seems to fluctuate.  Charged set in about 45 minutes.  Charged same set later and it took over 4 hours (as indicated by the light within the battery).Since it seems to drain rather quickly, I don't think this would be a good product for T.V. remotes and the like.  You would have to charge them after about a week of use.  As far as using for game pads, they did seem to work well, but you would either have to time exactly how long the batteries work so you could start the charge on the other set to use quickly, or rely on other batteries while the set charges.

Novel idea! Better than alkaline!
","

  Rechargable batteries giving constant 1.5 volts and easy to charge up! However, the devices I use these in require frequent recharging even after a week, vs regular alkaline batteries lasting a little over a month of same usage. The octopus charger it comes with is short and can be dangerous if plugged into a usb charger and into a wall outlet. They just hang there. I use a different micro-USB cord, that's much longer, to charge each battery at a time. Takes longer but it seems less risky that way. These batteries give constant 1.5volts of energy, however with other batteries that slowly die, these just quit out of the blue. So they are either working at 100% or 0%. Which is good if you need that. You can recharge them from a battery powerbank. I wish the charging cord was longer as they dangle from the usb charging brick plugged into an outlet. That worries me.

DO NOT get this to use in a MEDICAL DEVICE!!!
","

  UPDATE: I really need to stress how these batteries are NOT a good idea to use in a medical device.This keeps happening and putting me in dire situations, and it is entirely my fault cos I KNOW this.Whatever mechanism devices have to estimate the amount of charge doesn't work with these batteries. This means that your device will show that the battery is fully charged, and there won't be a warning before the battery goes dead. There is no way of knowing how long you have left. And because the use of your medical device can change a lot from day to day, there is no way you can even estimate an approximate time to replace it. I bought these to use in my insulin pump because the manufacturer recommends using lithium batteries. There have been so many times when I have been caught without an available replacement battery, and my insulin pump has died. I do carry the second one with me at all times because of this, but sometimes you are at the gym,  or taking out the trash (at the faraway dumpster of your apartment complex), or you just locked yourself out of your apartment, or doing some other activities, and the thing will die and send you in a frenzy because medical devices that are supposed to be on at all times have alarms (powered by an internal battery), because it is usually very DANGEROUS to have it power off without warning!=====================================================================They really don't last long between charges. And whatever mechanism devices have to estimate charge doesn't work with them, and there won't be a warning before they go dead. So its not a good use for medical devices, which is what I'm using them for. You better have replacements all the time.

  My only issue is the holder (clear plastic, picture 3) could be better. It's a snap latch I can foresee breaking off at a crease from the folding back and forth over time.The rest is great, and I should last a long time. The inputs on the battery itself proper are solid.I've never had a battery you literally plugin individually into a port before, normally you incase it and it charges on both the plus and negative side of it. I'd think some of this has to do with the new power and density of the lithium-ion battery, and the ability not to need as much as possible in the smaller space to best utilize it, which also makes sense for it there to be a potential for placing in the plastic case and using a AAA charge to power like a AA.

  This is a pack of 4AA batteries that are intelligently designed!  To charge your batteries, you just remove the top and place into any USB port.  VOILA... you are now fully charged (after a bit of time elapses).  The batteries arrive in a small clear carrying case which can be thrown in a bag or pocket.  Our son uses these batteries for his game controllers... those controllers eat batteries like they are going out of style.My only issue and this is a very scary one... the battery crashed his newish gaming computer once he plugged the battery into the USB port to charge.  We have charged the batteries off of wall plates, cell phone USB chargers and that one time we attempted, a desktop.  His computer instantly shut down/crashed and wouldn't reboot for a few minutes.  When we were able to get back on there was the blue screen stating that there was an issue.  We ran virus scans and some other programs because my son believed that it was a virus loaded onto the actualy battery which can kill a system once it is plugged in.  We couldn't substantiate this.  No one is allowed to plug these batteries into ANY computer because we are fearful.Can't recommend highly because of that computer glitch.  Besides that issue the batteries recharge quickly and hold their charge.  Afraid to think that someone may be spying or corrupting systems.  I hope not because I removed 2 stars because of that crash.

  An excellent alternative to normal rechargeable batteries, and way cheaper then using alkaline. If it lasts as long as it claims, it’s more than worth the price. I can’t say if they do yet, but the company says if they’re defective they’ll replace them so it does seem like they’re willing to stand behind their product. This set comes with 2 AA and 2 AAA, with 2 adaptors to turn the AAA into AA. If you need more AAA there’s another set with 4 AAA instead. For charging the AA battery’s tops pop off to reveal a standard USB plug you can charge in any USB outlet, the AAA ones have a micro-USB port on the side you charge with any micro-USB charger (they include one in the box). Personally I prefer the AAA’s micro-USB since they include a 4 port micro-USB charger, I had to use my PC ports to charge AA which wasn’t optimal, I wish they sold AA batteries with a Micro-USB port like the AAA. But hey that’s a minor quip, overall I still recommend these to anyone with electronics that like to eat up batteries.

It's been weeks since I placed it in my hands free trashcan.  My one year old likes to open and close it for laughs, so it gets used all the time and the batteries are holding up nicely.  I highly recommend.

Rechargeable lithium AA batteries (and AAA batteries), with built in USB connectors and case
","

  This set of batteries comes with a case and includes batteries with built in USB connectors to use to recharge them when needed. This is a practical way to have reliable power at hand without needing a special battery charger. These batteries can work in many devices that you would have used alkaline batteries for. This is a cost effective battery option. I have tried both the AA pack and the AA/AAA combo pack and both types of batteries are working fine.

Great for travel, office, etc. But for every day use there are better options
","

  Battery has a LED indicator that flashes when charging, and stays on when full.These are lithium, and they should last years. Both the AA and AAA are the same strength (1500mah).The AA charge by normal USB, and the AAA are micro - so you don't really need the included adapter, you probably have phone cords lying around that will work, or just plug them into your laptopI think this great if you travel with devices that require AA or AAA, or if you need them at a work station (like rechargeable mouse, etc). Outside of those specific needs, I'm not sure it's a value - the ""gimmick"" on these, and the excuse for the high sticker price, is the USB charging. I'm really not convinced that it adds any convenience for day-to-day battery use, since you're limited by how many spare cables & USB ports you have at the moment.You can get a 16-pack of Amazon Basics AAs or AAAs for about the same price, and recharge them 4 or 8 at a time with a wall charger. I think that's a better bargain and definitely more convenient for my lifestyle.

Super versatile set of rechargeable batteries
","

  This brand of rechargeable batteries has a few different sets, I went with the mix of 2 AAA, and 2 AA's which seemed to be the most versatile since the AAA size comes with an adapter to fit in AA if I need more AA's.Note that the AAA is smaller in 600 mWh capacity than the larger AA (1500 mWh) but that's the tradeoff in versatility with the size coverage. Also the AAA ones need a micro USB cable to charge (the set comes with a single USB cable split to 4 micro usb heads which more than covers the 2 included AAA batteries.The coolest feature that attracted me to these batteries was the AA heads come off and become a regular USB male plug that can go directly into any USB port like on a computer and charge directly without needing a separate cable or charger. This feature makes these so convenient as I don't have many devices that need batteries and didn't want the extra clutter of having a separate charger.I purchased these mainly for use with my Oculus Quest controllers which eat batteries very quickly, and so far the battery life even with the AAA's (on AA adapter) has lasted as long as the disposable AA batteries I had been going through. The investment in these batteries should more than pay off as I continue to use the Oculus, and even when I run into emergency needs for various controllers and remotes that run out.So far I'm really happy with these and hope that they continue to hold charge as they have been solid in a several days of continuous use.

  These are so incredibly clever!  Charging the batteries in a USB port takes only about 30 min, and then I've replaced all of my wireless device's batteries with these so the remotes, mice, and various things should be simple to recharge and re-use.  I've only been using these for a couple of weeks, so no need to recharge yet, but I'm optimistic so far.

  There are no instructions included. The manner of charging the triple AAA batteries is fairly obvious. The double AA not so much.

  What you get:2xAA-Li-ion USB batteries @ 1500mAh - Pull the end cap off, plug into a powered USB port (the stronger port on the left of my 2013 Macbook works, the port on the right does not). The manual does note that on desktop, it may be necessary to plug into the back of the computer as sometimes front ports are underpowered. Once the cap is replaced, it's identical to a AA battery. Very convenient. The indicator light on all batteries flashes during charging, and turns solid when done. The 1500mAh rating is also typical for a AA.2xAAA-Li-ion USB batteries @ 600mAh - These batteries require you to plug a micro-USB into the side, but otherwise look and feel just like a standard AAA.2xAAA>AA converters - Plastic caps with metal ends, snaps securely over a AAA to convert it to a AA, with only the AAA's smaller battery life. Super handy to have in a pinch.1x USB2.0 > 4x USB-micro adapter - Plugs into a standard USB 2.0 port, and provides 4 micro male plugs. You only need 2. Could be useful for travel when you need to recharge a lot of devices.1x AA Battery Case - Plastic case holding 4xAA batteries with latch. Nice.Overall - This is a great set. When in use, the batteries are identical replacements, and I haven't had a problem with any low-drain device (TV, Roku remotes). When these batteries are in use, you could keep emergency backups in the case, or even just keep the AAA>AA adapters in the case so you don't lose them. Very thoughtful. The micro-USB adapter is also nice. You may not need it if you already have a micro-USB device charging cable, but it's nice to have. Recommended.

Review of both AA and AAA options
","

  I acquired both the AA and AAA options of these batteries. They differ slightly in that the AAA is charged using an included USB adapter (Micro-USB) that plugs into all 4 batteries, whereas the AA battery plugs directly into a USB-A port. While there’s no need for the adapter on the AA, note that each battery requires its own USB-A port (so charging 4 at a time means you need 4 open ports). Because the AAA uses an adapter, you only need one open USB-A port to charge all 4 at once.Both batteries have a built-in light that blinks when charging. Once the blinking stops, you know the batteries are full. A minor difference, but the AAA has a green light whereas the AA a red one.Note that neither battery came with a wall charger. You will need your own source. I tested different options to see if any had issues. First, I used my fast charger from my OnePlus 7 Pro phone. Then I used an older (slow) wall charger for my Apple iPad. Finally, I used USB ports on my computer and a HUB connected to my computer. All options charged the batteries without issue.The Huahui AAA comes with capsules that convert them to AA. Unfortunately, there are 4 batteries but only two capsules. From what I tested; they definitely work. But I admit the capsules do feel a little cheap, and they are slightly longer than a true AA battery. I measured an AA Duracell at 1.96” (inches) and the Huahui AAA in the AA capsule at 1.98”. Not a huge difference at .02”, but if the device you are putting them into is picky, it may cause some problems. Additionally, the Huahui AAA battery itself is slightly larger (1.74”) than a AAA Duracell (1.72”). Again, that’s only a .02” discrepancy, but something to keep in mind.The Huahui AA on the other hand is the exact same length as the AA Duracell. Both measured in at exactly 1.96”. So, they should work in any device that takes AAs.The diameter of both batteries is spot on. I was even able to slide the Huahui AA into the very tight compartment on my Apple Magic Trackpad.I also tested these batteries (both AA and AAA in capsule) on my Wireless Xbox and Wii U controllers. Worked great. And both batteries were detected as having a full charge.While many devices today have built-in lithium-ion batteries, there are still many things that require traditional batteries. From flashlights, to remotes, to shaving devices. I love these Huahui batteries because they charge directly into a USB port rather than needing an external charger. Makes it super easy to transport and charge on the go, especially considering you can just pop them into a power bank. So far, I’m loving them and have had no issues.

Overall a great battery and great idea!

  Rechargeable batteries always seem like such a great idea. But you have to use a charger and they end up being more hassle than you realize.The Huahui USB Rechargeable AA Batteries Lithium Ion ECO-Friendly&Recyclable Double A High Capacity 1500mWh/1.5V Quick Charging for Camera/Fan/Mouse/Toy/Remote Control/Flashlight/Shaver(4 Pack) gets rid of the charger and makes it very easy to recharge the battery.All you do is VIGOROUSLY remove the positive terminal to reveal a MALE USB prong and plug it into a computer, or other charging device, and when it is charged, you have a battery ready to go again.This four pack comes in a convenient plastic case. The concept is simple and so far I don't see a big problem with battery life. I was a little worried that the space needed for the USB prong would take away space for the battery - and it does. But I don't know that it affects battery life enough to matter.To be fair, I am using them in a low current situation. I think these are awesome for remote controls. When they run down, you just charge them overnight and you are ready to go! FOR REMOTE CONTROLS, it doesn't get any better than this.The only real negative I see is making sure you don't lose the cap/positive terminal when charging. They could have possibly included some sort of wire or string/cable that kept it attached but it is a SMALL ISSUE.Overall, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND these to someone looking to replace a remote control battery. For a high current draw situation, like a toy, or something else - I would look elsewhere as you do have less battery to work with. But overall, for many uses these are excellent!Aplus!!!Thank you for reading my review.

💞💓💯💪👍Totally Different Paradigm in Portable Rechargeable Batteries/Charger 👍💪💯💓💞
","

   We all love anything that's rechargeable and reusable, not only it saves us money, but we help save Mother Earth at the same time. Hence, chances are that you have the old way of recharging your AA or AAA batteries, that is, some sort of NiMH rechargeable batteries and a charger set. Trouble is the typical charger is a little heavy, hence not as portable, or you put it up against a wall outlet standing vertically - the batteries sometimes would fall out of the charger or the entire batteries/charger will fall to the floors due to the poor design of its weight distribution. Well, fuss no more, here comes the Huahui AA+AAA Batteries Rechargeable USB Lithium Batteries ECO-Friendly High Capacity 1.5V Rapid Charging with 4in1 Charging battery set.Here's why I love them at first sight:#1. There's no actual charger - this saves materials and reduce plastic waste. Instead, you get a micro-USB port on each of the batteries, whether AA or AAA. This battery charging set also comes with a special octopus-like (well, more like a quad-pus) charging adapter cable, with one end typical USB Type-B end, and the other end micro-USB connectors. You simply plug each of these 4 connectors directly onto the micro-USB ports on the battery, then you  plug the USB-Type B end into any USB-AC power adapter that everyone has lying around into any electrical outlet#2. Lightweight & Portable: again, due to the lack of a bulkier charger, you're more likely to want to take it on-the-go while on a business trip or vacation, as long as you bring the special quadpus cable, it takes up nearly no room at all#3. Versatility: in the box, you get 2 AA and 2 AAA batteries, PLUS two AAA ==> AA plastic adapters. If you insert the two AAA into this plastic adapters, you essential just turn these two AAA into ANOTHER two AA batteries. Hence, this set of batteries basically provide you with: 1) 2 AA and 2 AAA or 2) 4 AA batteries (with the help of special adapters), how cool is THAT! 👍💪💯💓💞👍💪💯💓💞👍💪💯💓💞👍💪👍$4. Fast Charging: these four batteries take only an hour to get fully charged! While charging, you get this flashing green light show, when fully charged, you get SOLID green and the batteries are ready for use!#5 Eco-Friendly: the best beneficiary of this set of rechargeable battery set is Mother Nature, this will help reduce throwing away more non-rechargeable batteries into local landfillsIn SUMMARY, the Huahui AA+AAA Batteries Rechargeable USB Lithium Batteries ECO-Friendly High Capacity 1.5V Rapid Charging with 4in1 Charging Set presents a new paradigm in rechargeable batteries. NO separate charger is needed, instead, through the use of a special QUAD-pus cable which you'd insert DIRECTLY onto these rechargeable batteries micro-USB ports. Along with special cylindrical adapter permitting the flexibility of turning the 2 AAA batteries into another 2 ADDITIONAL AA batteries IF your situation require more AA batteries than AAA.Not only you'd feel good producing less waste but you'd actually want to take them EVERYWHERE!💞💓💯💪👍HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💪💯💓💞

AAA Batteries USB Rechargeable Lithium recharge fairly quickly
","

  I find myself needing more AAA Batteries  for my devices, and these are the easiest to recharge and do so fairly quickly. Since I am sitting in front of my computer all the time, it is very easy to plug the charger cord into the port, and since the plug can handle four AAA at a time, it is very easy to recharge them and insert them back into my device. Also, unlike the more conventional rechargeable batteries, these will remain at full capacity until it runs out of energy, so I don't experience any dimming or gradual loss of power. They run at full power until they run out and then they go dead all at once. I plan to buy more of them soon.

Great idea, low capacity.

  I am a big fan of USB-rechargeable Lithium batteries, mostly because they provide the 1.5V of alkaline batteries, which makes them more universal than NiMH or NiCd batteries with 1.2V. Most devices learned to deal with the difference, but some simply work better with the full voltage even if the difference is only 0.3V.The tip lights up green and blinks when charging, while turning steady once full. The included AAA-to-AA adapter may be useful for emergencies, but I don’t use them as the reduced capacity of these batteries (600 mAh) is really small compared to a standard AA with 2400 mAh.The USB charging is a great idea and thanks to the space constraints in a AAA battery, the USB-A connector  doesn't fit. I like that only because the USB-A version in the AA batteries sounds like a great idea, but even charger blocks with four USB outlets don't work well as the size of the battery is typically smaller than the diameter of the AA battery, allowing only every other slot to be used. With the microUSB forcing a harness of sorts, it's great to find a single harness included that fans out from a single USB-A to four microUSB plugs.Even if microUSB is probably the worst USB design of them all (sometimes very difficult to plug in right), it's still the dominant form factor even for new devices, despite USB-C being around for a while now. So if you lose the harness, you can probably easily find four USB-A to microUSB ""laying around"".Once plugged in, charging of all four batteries at the same time take as mere 0.5A at 5.2V. It doesn't take long for all four to be charged, either. That seems a bit odd, but turns out to be a byproduct of the low capacity of only 600 mAh per  battery. A standard alkaline AAA battery is typically rated at 1000 mAh (or nearly double). So you pay the price for convenience in longevity of the charge.So these are not the longest lasting batteries, but the voltage and over 1000 charges may make up for it for low power applications. I tried three of them in a nightlight rated at 0.7W, and the batteries were depleted after 5 days despite short illumination cycles (by using motion sensor). That is certainly not the place to use these batteries, but devices like remotes should work well.

  This is a set of 4 rechargeable batteries in AAA size, plus 2 cases to convert 2 batteries at a time to AA size. Each of the batteries has a USB micro charging port near the top. You can also recharge the batteries in a regular battery charger. The 2 AAA to AA converter cases are made of translucent plastic. Just slip an AAA battery in and then the battery will fit in an AA battery compartment. Also included in the kit are a USB A to 4x USB micro charging cable  (transformer not included) and a plastic case to hold the 4 AAA batteries.I find these batteries super-handy, especially for travel. You never know which batteries are going to fail in your devices, AAA or AA. With these batteries, you can carry the one set of batteries and use the converter cases if you need to replace some AAs. The quad-charging cable is also quite cool, something I’ve never seen before. With this cable you can charge all 4 batteries at once using up just one USB slot on your charging device. So you don’t to carry around a separate battery charger. Overall, this set is extremely handy for travel and a great way to save on batteries in the long run.

Easy to use

  I got these because I'm concerned about the number of batteries that I throw out each month/year. They just end up incinerated or in the dump which isn't good for anyone especially our precious environment. So I figured using more rechargeable/reusable batteries would be a good way to start. They're easy to recharge and all of the equipment is small and doesn't take up a lot of space. Apparently they can be reused/recharged over and over again for 1000 times or so. That's really exciting and I think that there's definitely ya lot of future potential for having these and not have to buy batteries again! :)

recharges fast

  Getting the cables into the batteries require a bit of effort, but once attached and plugged into a usb port, the batteries charge fast.  I tested them in several devices, one device failed to work with the batteries, but the device didn't work when I tested other brands, so the problem is probably with the device not batteries.  I can never find  batteries in the house when I need them, rechargeables are the way to go.

   Came nicely packaged in a little carrying case. Love the concept you don't need a charger to recharge these li-ion AA batteries just by removing the cap and plug into any 5v USB port.Each battery takes about an hour and half to fully charge and you can tell when the flashing red light becomes solid.Downside to charge all 4 batteries you need 4 USB port. Wish it allow to be charge on a charger too so this way you can use the usb as a backup if you are outside and don't have access to a charger.

💞💓💯💪👍 Most Ingenious & Versatile Rechargeable Batteries I've EVER Seen 👍💪💯💓💞
","

   Unlike more traditional rechargeable batteries + charger set, you get a seet of AA/AAA NiCD NiMH rechargeable batteries and a separate charger where you'd insert these batteries into.  These Huahui Li-ion AAA USB Rechargeable batteries are complete a breath of fresh air to me, as I've never come across anything quite like these.First, unboxing revealed that you get 4 rechargeable AAA Li-ion batteries with a built-in micro-USB charging port on each, you also get a set of two adapters, where you can insert these AAA batteries into the plastic adapter turning them into AA batteries (see my photos and video), and you also get a special cable with one end a typical USB Type B and the other 4 microUSB on the other ends. You can charge these AAA Li-ion rechargeable batteries all at once, while charging, you will see green beam like a light show - really cool and very convenient!Second, because no separate charger is needed, you get a very small & lightweight package that takes up nearly no room at all, and are more willing to take it along with you when travelling.Third, these 4 batteries charged fully in less an hour and ready for use on devices such as my nose hair trimmer, optical mouse, etc.Finally, as an eco-conscious dude, it's good to know that these batteries are eco-friendly and recyclable so I know I'm doing to my part to minimize negative impact on Mother Nature.The VERDICT==========Huahui AAA Batteries USB Rechargeable Lithium High Capacity 1.5V Fast Charging requires no separate charger, unlike traditional rechargeable charger + batteries combo unit. These special batteries have a micro-USB charging port onboad each of the 4 AAA batteries, in addition, 2 sets of special adapters can turn these into AA batteries, so in essence, it's effectively like you get either 4 AAA batteries, or 2 AAA & 2 AA batteries! HOW GOOD IS THAT! These batteries are also eco-friendly and recyclable with minimum damage on Mother Earth. Because no separate charger is needed, it's easy to take it on the go, on a business trip or summer vacation. If like me, you've never used one of these rechargeable batteries with mirco-USB charging ports on board, you're missing out! Get THEM, you will not be disappointed!💞💓💯💪👍HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💪💯💓💞

Combo set of AA and AAA uses a direct USB plug in for the AA batteries integrated into the battery.

  The AAA batteries use a side port to plug in the USB harness/splitter.  The AA batteries can have the top pole popped off and directly plug into a full size USB charger port.  The life of these batteries is good enough to more than justify the price not having to replace batteries all the time in my remotes and other devices is a good thing. Plus an answer to the question I posted, says they will work in a rechargeable device like a cordless phone, so you don't have to only charge them outside the device by USB.  If this is like a typical lithium after charging if you don't use right away it should hole that full charge for a considerable long time much longer than typical batteries or rechargeables.

  Clever design of the harness and the use of micro USB connectors to plug into the actual batteries.  Plus, since it can be charged via the poles you can use it with rechargeable phones, shavers, and other devices that charge with the batteries inside.  It should save me a quite a few dollars of buying alkaline batteries and use once lithium cells.  The harness I mentioned uses a full size USB as the source connection then has four micro USB connections that plug into the side of the batteries.  Kit includes some cheater sleeves to use these as AA's if so desired.  The price is worth the money if it comes anywhere near the 1000 charges.  Battery is resistant to building a memory like some of the older design rechargeable types, so you can typically charge at any level.  Cells have plastic translucent snap case for storage if not in use.  Recommended.

  What I love best about these rechargeable batteries is they are perfect for travel items. They do not require a fancy proprietary battery charger. It comes with a 4 split micro usb cable which u can plug into any USB port to charge. They are perfect for a wireless mouse, alarm clock, toothbrush etc. my son said they worked well in his xbox controller which surprised me. The AAA is 1000 mwh the AA is 1500 mwh.  They come with a holding case and the two AAA have an adapter to make them into a AA. I think that’s awesome.  The AA recharge by pulling the cap off and plugging into a usb. The cap is a little tricky to pull off.  I was trying to twist it at first.  They recharge in about an hour. The mouse showed me they were 100% charged after charging. I do think they are pricey at $25. For 4 rechargeable no super powerful batteries but I guess you are paying for the easy convenience of recharging on the go.

Nice versatile set of rechargeable batteries
","

  I love these batteries.  They are easily rechargeable without the use of an additional charging station.  The set comes with a USB cord that splits to 4 micro USB ends.  As well as 2 AA batteries, 2 AAA batteries and 2 adapters for AAA batteries to be used like AA batteries.The USB portion of the cable can be plugged into a computer or a charging block.  The micro USB ends get plugged into the side of the battery.  Being that there are 4 ends you can plug in and charge up to 4 of the AAA batteries at the same time.  The AA batteries however do not connect to the micro USB connector the plug directly into a USB port or charging block.The batteries take about an hour each to charge.  So, if you plug in all 4 at the same time you only need to wait 1 hour for 4 fully charged batteries.  The AAA ones are easy to do this with because they go on the same charging cable that splits 4 ways.  The AA's however go individually unless you use  USB hub.  You remove the cap to charge them but, the first time it may be especially difficult to remove the cap it does sit pretty tightly on there and it will only go back on in one direction.  While charging there is a flashing light on the end (green for AAAs and red for AAs) which changes to a steady light once fully charged.  These hold a charge well and last about as long as other rechargeable batteries I've used.  They also came with two adapter cases that allow you to use the AAA batteries as a AA battery which makes them even more versatile.

Do you go through a lot of bateries and want to cut down your waste
","

  I love these batteries!  If you want rechargeable batteries these are great because you don't have to have an additional charger to charge them in you can plug them into any USB port or a charging block and they will charge.  The caps were a little difficult to pull off the first time but have been fine after that first time.  The cap will only fit on in one direction when you put it back on.  These take about 1 hour each to charge though so if you want them all to charge at the same time I think the best way is to use a hub with 4 ports.  While charging, these have a flashing red light at the end which will become a steady light once fully charged.  They hold a charge well and last about as long as other rechargeable batteries I've used.This brand also has AAA batteries but those have a slot on them that you insert a micro USB cord into as opposed to taking off the cap and plugging the battery into a USB port  I kind of wish they had just used the same design on the AAs since the caps can get lost making the battery unusable.  Or at least the cap could be attached in some way so that it would be easier to keep track of.

An interesting set

  I have another set of usb-rechargeable batteries and like the idea of being able to recharge them on one of my usb charging stations.  The AAA batteries, for me, were ""typical"" with the small usb-c (I believe that is the designation for it) opening on the side of the battery, but the two AA batteries are different, having a ""cap"" of the positive post that pulls off to reveal a traditional usb plug.  I have not inserted any of the batteries into an item yet, but I am sure they will work just fine.  My own personal opinion is that I prefer the way the AAA batteries charge.  I found that the AA ones cannot be plugged in next to each other as they are round and take up too much space based on how the usb ports are arranged on any of my charging stations.  Other than that, these are great to have - one can never have too many charged batteries!

Best invention since sliced bread

  I don't know why it took me so long to discover these batteries. or maybe they are a recent invention. Regardless, they are wonderful. I do not like using disposable batteries for the obvious environmental cost.Most people throw away batteries in the regular garbage can and they must be disposed of properly. That's why I favor rechargeable batteries. But when you're traveling, rechargeable batteries are a pain because you have to take the charging station, which is often bulky. It also robs you of another plug in your hotel room, and you may not have that many plugs. That's why this is such a great invention because you can plug it into any standard USB port and it will recharge your batteries. I like the fact that each battery has a little red indicator light that blinks to show you that it's being charged and when it is finished charging.The price is reasonable for the amount of recharges you get. They also have a AAA battery version. The capacity for the double a batteries is 1,500 milliwatts. I hope the photos are helpful. When the battery is fully charged, it stays on. While it's charging, it's blinking.These are made in China. When you use up enough charging cycles, you still need to dispose of it properly.

  We are trying to be more ""green"", or as green as we can,. so I've been stocking up on rechargeable batteries.

But it doers work and not a fault of the product.This is the first set of batteries I've had that include a converter to AA. Really just plastic tubes, but they work. Just wonder how they will last. They do seem pretty durable. Guess it would be nice to be able to use them as AA or AAA.Plugged them in to a USB port and they started charging. They work as they should. So far they have worked in the few devices I've tried, so no compatibility issues yet. Will be sure to update this if I run into any trouble.All said, they seem like  pretty good batteries, the only slight negative I have is that they seem a little pricey for what they are.

  In this day and age, it’s hard not to buy stock in a battery company with the amount of double and triple As that you go through for almost every digital device! I have tried other rechargeable batteries in the past without much success. They took forever to charge, and didn’t hold a charge long enough to make it worthwhile to wait for them to charge up again.With this set, I have to admit to being impressed! They charge quickly, maybe having something to do with the USB method, which I had not seen in a battery charging set before. They also hold a charge through a lot of use. They still don’t maintain the length of charge that I get from a regular battery, but it is long enough, and the recharge short enough to satisfy me! I’d much rather use these and help do just that little extra moe for the environment!

   These Lithium Ion AAA rechargeable batteries are so convenient because you don't need a charger. All you need is any micro usb cable or the cable that comes with the set that can be plugged in on the side of the batteries and charge 4 all at the same time. Takes about 45 minutes to completely charge them all which is pretty fast.The green light will flash while its charging and when it's complete it stays solid green. Way to charge theee are limitless, because you can use wall adaptor, plug into your laptop or in my case I plug into my portable powerbank so it's even portable when you are out camping.It comes with 2 AA shell where you can put this AAA inside the shell and work as AA batteries.What I like about lithium ion rechargeable that they don't have memory like NiMh so can charge anytime and they hold the charge longer too.

Unique design, with room for improvement
","

  I have both the AAA and AA version of these batteries which have built-in chargers. They both perform well thus far and the design eliminates the need for a separate battery charger because you simply plug the batteries into a USB port to charge them. While the AA version has the USB plug built into the tip of the battery, the AAA ones (due to their smaller size) have a micro USB port on the side and come with a 4-way cable so you can charge all four at the same time from one USB port.It's a good concept in theory, but not the easiest to use. First, the batteries are black and the port is black as well, very small, and keyed so the plug can only go in one direction. I spent a good bit of time trying to get all the plugs into the batteries, which I found annoying and feel that it may not be something I'm willing to continue doing. If they had made the battery a brighter color so the port was easier to see and additionally used a USB-C port, which can be plugged in either way, this would have improved the design significantly and made them much easier to use. Making these changes would make this a solid 5-star product.Time will tell on battery life, but I would expect them to last longer than standard batteries since lithium batteries typically last longer.Overall decent product and good value with room for improvement

A green light blinks during charging and lights-up steady when charging is complete.- They last a good amount of time, of course it all depends on the frequency of use.- My 4-pack came with 2 ""AA"" shells which I can place 2 ""AAA"" into and they will then fit into devices that require ""AA"", there will be a lower duration of power of course.CONS:- None.

  These things come with a charging plug with 4 ends that enable you to charge all four batteries at once. They come in a really nice hard plastic storage box too. They also come with the coolest thing: They come with 2 AA Size empty shells that you can put one of these AAA batteries in each one and actually have a Working AA set of batteries. I’ve never seen that before and I’m loving that little bit of Tech.  I have 2 of these in my TV Remote and they’re working great. They’re supposed to hold a charge longer than a regular battery and last around 1,000 charges. I’m very happy with them!  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁

  These are definitely a huge step up from any Rechargeable Batteries I’ve ever had. These actually stay charged as a regular battery would, compared to my old rechargeable batteries that were only good for immediate use because, they would lose charge if they were used or not, quite quickly. These are awesome!  They charge by simply pulling off the cap of one end and it plugs into any USB Charger. They’re new for me but, if they stay charged as long as they say and last for the 1,000 or so charges that they say, these will be well worth it. They’re working perfectly and get 5 Stars. I’ll update if things change.  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁

  Admittedly, this is an unusual design for rechargeable batteries - having a micro-USB that plugs directly into the batteries for charging is something I've never seen before, but, so far, it's working just fine!You get everything seen in my pictures - 4 AAA batteries in a plastic case, 2 AA-size cases that you can put the AAAs in to use in something that needs AAs (another interesting accessory I've never seen before), and lastly the USB cable with 4 micro USB connectors for the batteries.When charging, one end of the batteries light up and blink green, and when charged, they'll stay solid green.Overall they're working just like any other AAA battery so, I'm satisfied!

Good Batteries, Good Support from Nanfu
","

  I bought 8 of these batteries form ""Nanfu Direct"" last year. Recently found that 2 batteries were dropping to ZERO volts. I contacted Nanfu requesting help and if possible 2 batteries as replacement, and they very quickly replied and send 4 new batteries.Since they pump out a constant 1.5V, they get consumed faster than normal rechargeable batteries. They are also little smaller in mAh capacity (180 mAh) as compared to the usual 2500mAh rechargeable. They also charge very fast.5stars for the Nanfu customer support and 4 Stars for the product.

What the heck do I do with all my old NiMH batteries now?!?
","

  These batteries are absolutely brilliant.  They look like AA batteries, but inside each one is a 3.7V 750mAH lithium ion cell and a voltage regulator.  The voltage regulator takes the 3.7V output from the li-ion battery and steps it down to 1.5V and *keeps* it there until the internal cell drops below operating voltage spec (usually around 3.3V).  At which point, the voltage regulator drops the voltage from 1.5V to 1.1V, enough for most devices to trip the ""low battery"" indicator.As for the longevity, I can honestly say that I have no idea how long the batteries last.  I bought the set of four AA batteries with the charger and I keep that in my bag with my PowerA Wireless GameCube controller for Switch.  I play Smash Ultimate about 4 hours a day for 4-5 days a week (not competitive, I just really like the game) and rotate the batteries out each day (use batteries 1 and 2 on Day 1, batteries 3 and 4 on Day 2, 1 and 2 on Day 3,you get the idea).  I charged all four batteries to full back in February and decided to see how long they would last.I haven't charged them since.For comparison, the same amount of playtime on standard alkaline batteries is around 80ish hours (batteries that came with the controller at 1.6V gave off the low battery warning after a month and reported 1.15V on my multimeter).  The last NiMH batteries I tried in these controllers were Eneloops, but those always gave me the ""low battery"" indicator on the controller.The price is a bit steep, but considering each battery has gone through about 240 hours of gaming without a hiccup, I'd say it's well worth the money.

Lasts FOREVER in wireless mic packs
","

  Since rechargeable lithium AA batteries are a relatively new technology and I'll be using them on paying, live event video jobs, I was pretty skeptical and thus first tested them in my wireless mic packs against a stopwatch in order to determine their longevity before taking them into the field for actual use on the job.  My older NiMH batteries will typically last about 2-3 hours in the wireless mics, whereas these lithium batteries lasted 6.5 hours before I simply gave up and turned off the mics out of boredom!!  That's WAY more time than I need for almost any conceivable recording situation, so I'm definitely a fan of these batteries!  I love the way each battery lights up blue while it's charging, the charing process happens relatively quickly, and they're quite lightweight compared to NiMH or alkaline batteries which is a nice little bonus when I'm packing around many pounds of equipment on a shoot. Recommended!

Deceptive description of capacity, NOT!
","

  Mike J. incorrectly calculated mWh at 1.5V using cell capacity of 750mAh, ""at the rated 1.5volt output the actual capacity is 1.5v * 750mAh = 1,125mWh."" This is wrong.He didn't convert the current like the Lithium Cell's 3.7V voltage is converted to 1.5V. This is a 2.467 reduction ratio and the current will see same ratio but as an enlargement. Remember, Power In = Power Out. (almost, as there is a small inefficiency in the conversion process).So, 1.5 * (2.467*750mAh) = 2775mWh. Just like the manufacturer stated. In reality, due to inefficiency probably closer to 2500mWh.Another way to look at this is, if a product draws 1A at 1.5V, this is only 405mA being drawn off the Lithium Cell at this time using 2.467 ratio with an ideal converter. However, If the ""real"" buck converter is 90% efficient (reasonable number to use) then actual current off the battery is slightly higher at 450mA.

  Unlike regular rechargable batteries which only provide 1.2 V and voltage slowly decreasing as battery charge is depleted, these ones provide consistent 1.5v throughout the charge. This makes them a great choice for things like motorized toys.However, the capacity isn't very high. They don't go as long as a regular non-rechargable battery would go and they definetly don't go as long as normal lithium batteries. But they charge quickly so it is not a big issue. I have charged an earlier set for up to 50 times now without any issues.

  I also bought another brand of similar batteries and the recent review of those is the same,  this brand is just a little more expensive.  Here is that review:These batteries came with a charge and I was able to use them immediately,  which I suggest, in order to drain them down before charging them.  I am absolutely thoroughly happy with these Tenevolt batteries.  I use them in my roku remote with private listening (headphone jack) and the volume is totally noticeable! I also use them with my spinbrush toothbrush and MAN that's the fastest I ever heard that brush spin! Most of whatever negative reviews you read about these batteries are probably due to not discharging the batteries FIRST before charging them. These don't come with the charger, however they do offer it.They come with enough power to use upon arrival and it will deliver peak power until the bms (battery management system) in each battery turns it off.  These batteries are definitely worth the buy, I used to buy the Energizer and Duracell rechargeables but the power doesn't last and they horribly fade and quickly.  These batteries are your solution, and NO I'M NOT PAID TO WRITE THIS AND I PAID FOR THEM WITH MY OWN MONEY! I just believe in giving people/businesses their flowers while they live.

  Bought a set of these to use in Blink XT cameras.  Maybe bad batch or bad luck but the batteries worked fine at first but then the cameras I used them in both died.  Wild speculation: I suspect the circuitry that regulates the voltage down to 1.5V is not reliable and it has a voltage spike up to 3.7v as it dies out and fries the camera.

I'd recommend checking out EBL 1.5V Lithium Rechargeable instead which have a higher mAh rating iirc.

  I am a new VR enthusiast and wanted a good battery to use for my controllers.  After using copper tops and Amazon basics rechargeables that would never last for more than a session or not show a full charge in Steam or WMR, I bit the bullet and paid the hefty sum for 2 sets of these.  After a week and a half and easy 20 hours of gaming I'm still over half battery!  If I get the means I will get the wall 20 battery unit to free up some usb ports.  Very impressed!

  Happy to see that someone is making fully enclosed rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries. these are fairly durable, it seems you have to cut into them to get to the circuitry which is all sealed unlike the ones with individual USB ports.They're true to their word on capacity to an extent, the mAh rating on the battery is actually the capacity of the 3.7v cell inside the casing. After 3.7v DC > 1.5v DC conversion the mAh rating on the AAs is actually closer to ~2450 mAh.Some nice to haves are the constant 1.5v output, makes laser pointers shine bright up until the battery depletes. I no longer feel guilty expending a ton of AAAs for the sake of my cats entertainment. Also you don't have to worry about getting them wet since they're sealed. I wouldn't take them diving though...

  Sale price made it worthwhile to test.  First installed on an alarm siren.  Batteries do not last as long as alkaline AA but these will have a much longer life.  If you purchase these for something similar to my alarm siren, you will need time to measure voltage, does not drop like an alkaline, and check for operation to determine recharge cycle times. Then expect to set up a calendar reminder.  Keep in mind the battery will hold voltage until it is almost ready to croke.  This makes it best suited for applications where failure, discharge, is acceptable.  My siren application is acceptable because I have 6 sirens so a temporary down of one siren is acceptable.

  I bought more than 10 packs of these thinking they were supposed to be long-lasting.  But I was wrong.  I put 2 of these in my flashlight and they only lasted about 2 minutes after a fresh charge.  At first, I thought it was a few dead batteries, then I had 40 to play with and they all lasted 2 minutes and the flashlight just die.

  So far from my testing (i have the $200 20 battery and wall charger) these batteries last less than half (actually nearly 3 times less) than energizer ultimate lithium batteries.  I performed equal tests in two different flashlights.  brand new energizers and these were fully charged.  started them up at the same time.  the energizers were still going over 2.5 hours and these batteries failed and lost charge at just over an hour in the same devices.i guess the good thing about these batteries are the number of times you can charge them and how quickly they charge (less than 2 hours) but I wouldn't buy these again simply because for a lithium battery they simply are not nearly the quality of a duracell or energizer lithium battery.....not even close folks so don't get your hopes up when you see these.

  I purchased these because the amazonbasics 1.2V rechargeable batteries were always read as low in my controllers. They would even turn off by themselves despite being fully charged.With the TENAVOLTS, the batteries are almost perfect. good for hours, no performance issues. Only downside is the controller will always think the battery is full, but the batteries last for so long that it's never an issue. In the 6 months that I owned these, I only recharged them about 1-2 times per month, and I've never had the batteries run out on me (I play 5-10 hours of VR per week).

  Tested with a serious professional electrician digital vom that is suppose to be super accurate.  The voltage on all four batteries came in an 1.53 volts.  Very nice.  Now will check on device after several weeks to see how this figure remains.  Zinc carbon and alkaline batteries start high, typically 1.6 volts, and slowly reduce in voltage.

Deceptive description of capacity
","

  The TENAVOLTS Rechargeable 1.5v Lithium 2775 mWh AA batteries are actually 3.7v LI-ion batteries in a AA housing with internal voltage converter to reduce 3.7v battery to 1.5v output. The package received states rating as 2775mWh,  750mAh, 1.5volts.  The deception is in claiming 2775 mWh at 1.5v.  Nowhere in the Amazon description does it state the battery mAh capacity as only 750mAh.  Lithium 3.7v battery will have stated mWh rating;  3.7v * 750mAh = 2,775mWh.  However at the rated 1.5volt output the actual capacity is 1.5v * 750mAh = 1,125mWh.  If intended use is a camera flash or other device with high current draw, stick with name brand Ni-MH.

  These are hands-down the best battery you will ever purchase! I use them primarily in my Garrett AT Max metal detector and they outlast every other traditional battery I have tried (including non rechargeable energizer etc). I’ve also noticed a performance boost because these run continuously at 1.5 V until dead rather than dropping slowly as you use the device.One thing you should know however is that your device will not notify you when the battery is nearly dead because it will still receive the full 1.5V. It will simply shut off when the battery is exhausted and ready to recharge.

","

  These (with 5 of the tiny elastic bands for braces on them, to keep them from sliding around) work fantastic for the Oculus Quest controller to fix tracking issues in Beat Saber. I wish they lasted longer, but they work perfect right to the end. And they're lighter than a normal AA, which also helps keep them from sliding around in the controller. When you swing down fast the centripetal force can be enough to compress the spring in the controller and make the positive end of the controller lose contact enough to mess with tracking for a split second. Very annoying. These fix that.

Truly put out full power until they need recharging

  I have used rechargeable batteries for about ten years now.  After four months of using Tenavolts, they have proven to lasted just as longs as my other rechargeable batteries, but they really do put out full power until they are dead and need to recharged.  With every rechargeable battery i have used up until now, after just two or three days in an electric toothbrush would run noticeable slower, but fast enough.  The Tenavolts ran as if they were just charged and showed no slowing down for over three months.

  Expected these rechargeable Lithium to be at least as good as regular alkaline batteries. Used AA size for a Neeweer Speedlite flash and AAA for a small LED flashlight. For both applications the Tenavolts discharged very fast. Compared with regular batteries: 31 flashes - Tenavolt, 318 flashes - Brand A, 409 flashes - Brand B.In the LED lamp Tenavolts lasted 1:54 h versus 5:40 h Brand A at full brightness. Note that the Tenavolts shut off when discharged and the Brand A alkaline continued working after 5:40 h for many hours more at reduced brightness.

  I bought two identical LED dive flashlights. I loaded one flashlight with ray-o-vac alkaline batteries, and the other with tenavolts batteries - fully charged.Woke up the next morning and the ray o vac flashlight was still lit , but the Tenavolt flashlight was completely dead.Disappointed, I installed the two remaining fully charged batteries back in the flashlight to see exactly how long these batteries will  last. After 15 minutes, the batteries were very HOT to touch, but not hot enough to burn my hand.After 16 minutes. the flashlight completely shut off. It did not go dim, it just completely shut off. Convinced that the plastic flashlights were causing the batteries to overheat - I re-charged the batteries, put them back in the flashlight,turned it on, and placed it in the freezer - on top of an ice tray. Fortunately, the fan in the freezer had just turned on, causing the freezer to act like a convection freezer. (even colder than Buffalo in a blizzard at night).I checked back in 16 minutes and the light was still on - 17 still on,  19 still on, 20 still on, at 22 minutes it was dead.The LED was ice cold and the batteries were only warm. So it turns out the batteries were not overheating and shutting off as a result- it appears this is all the energy they have ! 16 minutes in a LED flashlight - unless you live in Buffalo, and want to trek thru a blizzard at night, then you have 20 minutes till blackout.VERY DIsappointing!

  The main reason I bought these rechargeable lithium batteries was to save money over the long run using in my 4 Nest battery-powered smoke detectors around my house. The Nest Detect takes 6 lithium Energizer batteries about every 6 months and they are pricey. I tried the Tenavolts batteries and after a few hours, the Nest Detect starting chirping for low battery even though the batteries were fully charged. I believe the Tenevolts don't have a high enough mAh capacity to power the smoke detector.

  I purchased these for use in wireless microphone transmitters. I can get about 8 hours from 2 batteries per charge. That's plenty for any show I do.  Disadvantages is, the battery indicator on the microphones is always 3 out of 3 bars. The indicator does not indicate capacity remaining, only voltage.  I wish they made an 8 bay charger, or something more than the 4 bay and less than the 20 bay.8/11/20Follow up.I now have 2 of these chargers and 16 AA batteries. I use them for karaoke mics. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to use them every day since Covid to really test their durability/cycling tolerance.I'm using them in VocoPro 5800 mics. I can leave the mics on for a 4 hour show with no issues. I've left them on for a 7 hour show with no issues.They charge pretty quickly. I've never had to wait more than about 90 minutes for 4 batteries to charge. I have both chargers plugged into a 7 port powered USB hub. The chargers draw about 1.25 amps per charger. The hub is capable of 30 watts which is 6 amps at 5 volts, but I'm guessing that the charger is only capable of drawing the 1.25 amps, which is half of 2.4 amps, which is what a normal phone charger delivers to a phone. It's probably because it's charging at a lower voltage. Perhaps 1.5 volts x 1.25 amps which is just a little less than 2 watts (1.875 watts).One thing I've found is that if the batteries sit for any length of time (say, over 2 weeks) and you try to use them, they don't hold their charge. I used 2 week old batteries in a couple mics recently and they squealed out and died less than an hour into the event.When fully charged, though, with these mics, they last a good long time. At least 7 hours as stated above.2 minuses:1. Using with mics with battery indicators is, the battery indicators work off voltage. When the voltage decreases, the battery indicator is supposed to glow. With these batteries maintaining a constant 1.5 volts, there is no indication that the batteries are dying. They just quit. Once they dip below 1.5 volts, they just shut off.2. They're expensive.

Works Great In My VR Controllers!
","

  This is one of the only battery types out there that works in my VR controllers (O+) and lasts and lasts and lasts. The only negative to that is that you don't get a depleting battery gauge, it just goes until it dies. But I believe that's because these squeeze out every last drop of power until the safety/protection kicks in.Thankfully they charge pretty fast (depending on what USB charger you plug them into). I had a full charge again in less than 2 hours. Oddly enough, the batteries themselves have a blue light on the bottom indicating charge status. While in the charger Blue on = charging; Blue off = done.The negatives I came across are:1. You can't charge these on anything but the included charger. I tried charging in an expensive battery charger and it will either charge these for a while then just stop, or it doesn't even start charging them. I noticed rapid flickering of the blue lights on the batteries when my charger showed 99% then some stopped but others kept charging for a while. (I'm not sure if they were being charged at all because when I put them into their own charger they went for a while and stopped charging, this could be because their charger is timed and not a smart charger though, I never tested their voltage to see for sure but maybe one day I will...) The ones that stopped charging on my charger won't charge on it again.. It just doesn't ""see"" them at all anymore, they still seem to charge fine on their own charger though. But it makes me wary that the batteries may be damaged now.2. Cost. These are pretty expensive for a 4 pack of AA batteries. And I'm not sure if they'll last long enough to break even vs Alkaline or vs NiMH because some of what I've read about them isn't great on the durability front.3. No included power adapter. The back of the charger says to use a power source that is 5 volts and up to 2.4 Amps input. The manual says don't go over 5v input as it may damage the charger. Otherwise ymmv as to how long your charge takes.Otherwise that's it, they just work and none of the claims I've read from them have been misleading.

  Needed some rechargeable 1.5V batteries so my Nimh batteries wouldn't work. Some devices like our VR controllers need 1.5V. We also have some other devices that don't work well with the Nimh batteries lower voltage like my GPS and digital camera accessories. Searched around Amazon and these popped up. I wasn't sure about the USB charging so didn't buy them right away but then they came up on sale so bought a set.  Seemed to work fine, not as fast charging as my Nimh Enerloops but I like the 1.5V. Well after about 6 months, I noticed I was not getting any lights on the charger so contacted the seller and they asked about my problem and once I told them what I was seeing, they offered to send a replacement. I thought I would get a charger but they sent a new kit. They are charging now and seem to be fine. I'd like to thank the seller for such a hassle free service. I think the vendors on Amazon provide better service because Amazon holds them to a higher standard. I can't say that for Wal..... vendors, I won't buy from any of their vendors anymore since they don't back the customers.

  If your device is well designed, it will work normally as your alkaline or NiMH battery gradually decreases in voltage.  The Tenavolts are for those devices that are very fussy about the voltage.  The batteries are expensive, but they perform exactly as advertised, and deliver an extremely constant 1.5 volts.  And they can handle high current spikes easily.  I use them in motorized Nerf blasters which are famous for eating batteries.One last thing, ""Nanfu Direct"".  I'd never heard of the company, so I didn't know what to expect.  Well, one of the 12 Tenavolts batteries I got proved defective.  It took a few weeks to find this out.  I emailed Nanfu through Amazon's link, explained what happened, and asked if they could replace the bad one.  I got the ""thank you, please allow 1-2 days for a response"" message.Instead of 1-2 days, they responded within hours, apologized for the problem and immediately sent a replacement.  I'm impressed.

  I use these for Xbox One game controllers while gaming on PC. Unbelievable performance - they last FAR longer than other (typically NiMh) batteries between charges, and are MUCH lighter. I appreciate the weight savings more than anything; my controller feels flyweight in comparison to standard batteries. Another great benefit is that these seem to be current regulated, meaning they supply the same amount of power to the device regardless of charge level, until they are almost depleted. Charging is fast, I only wish I didn't have to use their specific charger (they are designed to be used ONLY with the included charger). Price is quite high but I got mine on sale and I'm super happy.

Great power fair price

  I’ve been using other rechargeable  batteries for years but these new Tenavolts are kicking butt over them with their last ability and the way they retain the charge.  I still have to get used to the way these work since when they need to be recharged the power just drops dramatically compared to how the other brands of rechargeables taper off slowly these drop more abruptly but I just pop a fresh set in and go.  I recommend them for things like wireless trackpads or keyboards or tv remotes, etc.

  I use these in my August smart lock. The regular NiMH or NiCad batteries don't charge to a full 1.5v and wear down fast, so the lock always gives an error about the batteries needing to be changed, even when they're brand new. These lithium batteries deliver 1.5v until they're dead, so I get no errors and the lock works at full power.The only downside is that since they don't drop below a certain voltage, I don't get low battery warnings. Just have to remember to recharge them every other month and it's fine.

  These are great. I’ve used them for the past few months. I use them in my Xbox One controller and they last a very long time. I play many hours of video games each day and I am able to get a solid week out of a charge. I got these on sale for about $12... and for that price, the value is killer. They are currently priced at $35 which at first sounds a bit high, but now knowing that the battery life is as long as it is, I think it's totally worth it!One con: when they die, they die. There is no indication that they are close to dying - the Xbox shows full battery all the way up until the controller shuts off and won’t turn back on... kinda sucks mid-game, but I’ve learned to just charge them after a few uses.

These are some pretty cool batteries, if you like rechargable batteries try them out!
","

  These batteries are pretty cool. I used them for a couple months and they last a good while. They do charge very quickly. I was surprised when they were done charging so fast.Time will only tell how long these batteries will last as far as longevity goes (in years) but I got them for an incredibly low price so I couldn't resist trying them out.The big thing here is these will hold a voltage around 1.5v for the entire use of the battery. This means the voltage will drop off quickly when the batteries are at the end of charge, so your devices will just die on you when the batteries die. This also means you likely won't face low battery messages or any other kind of annoyance until the battery is fully dead and your device shuts off. I use nimh batteries and those, they seem to flash a low battery warning on just about everything for the entire use of the product. Its also impossible to get them fully discharged which results in poor performance over time, however most people say these kind of batteries don't have memory effect but they seem to last less and less each time I use them. The only way to get a nimh battery to full discharge is to put them in a charger that discharges the battery, I have that charger and I have done that many times, and most of the time I take the batteries out they still have quite a bit of power left in them even though my device reports they are dead batteries that need recharging. These batteries don't do that, they will fully drain and your device will shut off when the batteries need to be changed or recharged.  These batteries would be especially ideal for the Xbox 360 controller which flashes a very bright, annoying dancing light when the batteries are low.You can't put these batteries into camera flashes, the product manual says so, so those who want to use them for that will be out of luck.I did put these batteries in a AA battery digital camera and they worked just fine and lasted a long time. I used the flash too.You also have to use the charger that is provided, I haven't had a problem with it, but you won't be able to use your other fancy chargers.You can charge these with any USB charger, it doesn't come with a USB charger so you will have to provide one, however this is very handy as you don't have to have a separate charger plugged in for these batteries.

Nice constant voltage, but abrupt drop-off  :)
","

  All too many devices need AA cells, not many take 14500s (4.2V out of the charger), and some don't like NiMH cells (constant 1.2V), so these fill the niche in providing a constant 1.5V from fresh out of the charger 'til they abruptly drop dead.  And I despise alkaleaks, as those hateful little things will leak their corrosive innards in your flashlight, remote control, wireless mouse, whatever you have them in, and ruin the device.  So trying these Tenavolts was a nice compromise between maintaining a fresh-alkaleak voltage from start to end, no drop-off.They charge easily in the included charger (straight 5V from the USB supply), lighting the cell's internal LED while charging, and going out when done.  That's it.While they may not work in high-drain devices like camera-flash units (not like that's plastered allllll over the description in multiple places), they do work fine in AA flashlights like my SP10 and E03.  In fact, my E03 has perfect mode-spacing when using an alkaleak, but all modes are brighter and clustered together when using a 14500, so the Tenavolt keeps that nice mode-spacing without the slightest danger of leaking inside the light itself.  And so it is for most AA-powered doodads that I tried.My only critique is that sudden drop-deadness when the internal cell is spent.  There's zero warning, no dimming or fading (slow or rapid) to forewarn that you have 5sec of light left, etc.  It's unnerving.  Still, I just keep a space cell handy Just In Case.  It's a small price to pay to be able to rest assured that you won't come back to a salt-block and ruined springs/contacts where an alkaleak used to be.Constant unwavering 1.5V from start to end, no chance of leaking and ruining the device it's in, vs a sudden death when the cell needs recharging.  Whether it's right for you depends on you.  I'm fine with the one and only drawback, and am using these in multiple goodies.

Add a star for 6 stars.Recharge cycle a bit slower than claimed, with 2.5 hours or so, and full charge capacity at 1 amp discharge of 1600 to 1650 mAh.  Minus 1 star for 5 stars.  (this is because of the claimed recharge rate of 1 hr and 48 minutes and a bit below the claimed 2700 mWh.  Still a very good showing, especially for a constant 1 amp load)For those that don't want to throw away batch after batch of alkaline batteries, these serve the great fill-in purpose for those devices that don't work with NiMH or NiCd rechargeables because of the voltage disparity between alkaline and NiMH/NiCd chemistry.  As these put out a very solid 1.5 volts, if you have devices that don't quite seem to work as long as they should, or even at all, with NiMH/NiCD, then these are excellent choices.  While NiZn can also do the trick, they do go up to 1.65 volts, which may be damaging/problematic for some devices, while these should never be cause for concern, as 1.5 volts is well within the operating range (at first) for alkaline batteries.These are more costly than NiMH, so I plan on using them in devices that I used to have to make the choice between usability (high with Alkaline/low with NiMH) and cost to environment (alkaline high, NiMH low) and per usage cost (alkaline high, NiMH low).For example, my son's electric song/piano toy required that I find the best performing NiMH batteries, and even then performance would quickly degrade such that the toy would become unusable long before I would expect from high performance NiMH batteries (Eneloop pro and Amazon 2400).  Upon trying these out, the toy works perfectly, with long run life. No more swapping/charging batteries too quickly, or giving in to alkaline!Another example is a laser level I have.  When I use my best NiMH batteries (2 batteries required), the unit will detect the lower voltage as an issue, and start to flash in the pattern that indicates low battery voltage.  While it still works, it is disconcerting/unpleasant to have it continuously flash while trying to line-up any work.  With these, the laser light is rock steady, and I am no longer bothered by the flashing (or with throwing away the alkaline batteries that only last a couple of hours).If you have devices that work with NiMH/NiCd, then don't fret about these batteries.  But, if you have devices that need a little bit more oomph, then these will fit the ticket.Since they give full voltage until exhaustion, detection that works upon voltage for low battery indication will not be reliable, so do not use them if you require sufficient notice that they are about to go out.  For me, when the device stops working is fine, as I can just grab another two and swap them out quickly, with no danger.  (maybe add a beeping sound to the circuitry when the internal li-ion is at the last 10 percent or so?)Time will tell about longevity.  I have NiMH low discharge AA's that have been working 10 plus years at over 90 percent of original capacity.  If these go half that length of time, they will pay for themselves, and if they go to 10 or more years, then even more in the green!

These do not work well in high current applications, but seem ideal for many uses
","

  I bought these because I was interested in the new technology and I have, in the past, had devices that needed 1.5 V to work properly.  The firsts things I tried one of these batteries in was an inexpensive 100 lumen  AA powered  LED flash light.  I expected the light to be brighter with a 1.5 V battery  than with the, 1.2 V, NIMh AA battery I had been using, but I didn't see any difference in brightness.  Then I read reviews that complained about the batteries getting hot and not working well as NiMh in camera flash units.  That told me that these batteries have higher internal resistance than NIMh or regular 3.6 V Lithium  batteries. I'm guessing that is caused by the protection and voltage regulation circuitry in each battery.For most AA battery uses, e.g. remotes or other low powered electronic devices, this is not going to be an issue. I note, in another review, that the reviewer is happy with their performance powering his kids toy cars which is a not a low powered application, and, because of the voltage regulation, those cars maintain constant performance till a battery shuts down to protect itself.Camera flashes or high power flash that need to suck energy out of a battery as fast as as possible to quickly recharge the flash and devices that use the battery's voltage drop to sound an alarm to let the user know the batteries need to be replaced, like smoke alarms, shouldn't use this kind of battery.The simple battery charger/holder supplies charges these batteries fast when plugged into a USB power supply and the batteries that aren't being used can be left in it plugged in or not. Lithium batteries have very good low temperature performance so these batteries are good for outdoor use even in cold weather. The fact that the battery output voltage is compatible with devices designed to use non rechargeable batteries is useful as is the fact that they either deliver 1.5 volts or disconnects from the load. Personally, when travelling, I'll be carrying then, in their case/charger, with me and using my laptop to and the supplied cable to charge them as needed.

  Got this during a deal, 4 pack with charger for $10. Even then these don’t seem to last as long as I had heard l-ion would. I use these in a little string of copper wire lights as a night light for my son. Normal rechargeable batteries lasted us two 12-hr nights. These only last two 12-hr nights too, but are brighter. The downside is when these batteries are going dead the lights begin to flash almost strobe like and frighten my son if he wakes up in the middle of the night and sees this. Definitely wouldn’t pay $35 for them now.

  I needed a set of AA batteries for office supplies. (wireless mice and keyboards) These fit the bill perfectly. Since they stay at a constant 1.5V until dead, they are perfect for other applications too. They seem to go a long time on a single charge, I believe they last longer than other rechargeable batteries I've bought in the past, but that could be just my imagination. I bought a second set of these to use at home as well. I have a trail camera that they are in right now, and they seem to be lasting a long time in that as well.

My Tenavolts experience
","

  Overall, these are decent batteries.  Personally, I use these to supplement my Eneloops and other NIMH batteries.The plus side of these batteries, is of course, the 1.5 volt output versus the lower NIMH battery output.  The minus is the fact that these have less capacity overall when you delve into the data.However for some devices, these our a necessity as NIMH rechargeable don’t provide enough voltage for items to work correctly.  One instance is a little submarine with a simple motor my daughter has for the pool.  An Eneloop AA fails to get the motor to perform as the voltage is too low, however the Tenevolts AA powers it around the pool.These batteries also work better for my Z wave locks, as the NIMH eneloops worked, but the locking action wasn’t as crisp, and sometimes would fail.  When you factor in the fact that each lock takes 4 batteries, the NIMH had a bit lower voltage overall.However, one device that does work better with eneloops was my Halloween LED village, with about 9 small led lights.  Some eneloop AA would keep the lights up and running for days on end, Although not as bright as the tenevolts.  However the tenevolts only would last about a day at max brightness, and when they started  to get low and run out, would strobe and flicker the lights.  It must have something to do with the circuitry providing the step down voltage, but they didn’t last even close to as long.They aren't bad, but unless you need the extra voltage go with Nimh rechargeables.

Awesome Batteries

  I got these batteries because they were on sale with a coupon code to get it for $11. I probably wouldn’t buy these for their normal price. They are great. Once I got them, I threw them in my La Crosse charger and charged them up. I am currently using them in a pair of XBOX One S controllers and wow! They lasts a long time! I have 4 of the Amazon Basics rechargeable, the grey with the green ring, along with the white ones and they lasts maybe 2-3 days. The same Tenavolt batteries are in the controller for over a week now and it still shows the battery is full. Each time we use the Amazon ones, even after a full charge, it will show maybe 80% charged in the controller, that is probably due to the batteries not charging to 1.5v I will buy more of these if there is ever a sale again, since spending $35 for 4x plus a charger I don’t need is kind of expensive.

Long lasting for my Sangean digital radio but adds distortion to the sound
","

  I picked these up for a Sangean radio which eats through rechargeable batteries like crazy. The radio requires a set of four AA's. And even with the 2450 mAh ones, I can barely get a few days of use from the radio before I need to open up the battery compartment, test which battery is weak or dead, then replace it. What's especially annoying is the fact that only one of the four battery need be weak or dead for the radio to shut down. For most devices I've owned, the remaining batteries can compensate well enough for a weak or dead battery. But not this Sangean radio.Flash forward, I decide to try these batteries to see if they make a positive difference. And they do.. lasting much longer in this radio than all previous and ordinary rechargeables.BUT... pretty quickly after I started using these TENAVOLTS, I started noticing a lot of static in the radio speaker. So much so, that it's become unlistenable. When I place standard rechargeables or alkaline batteries back again, the sound is clear once again.  So these TENAVOLTS are creating some kind of interference.  Bummer! Back to the battery drawing board, I guess.

  Good idea but failed to satisfy. I originally used AA rechargeable NiMH batters for a flashlight I keep on my hard hat and for a laser lever for work. The problem with the NiMH is that they dim and take FOREVER to charge. What I didn’t like about the LI-ion batteries is that they made my flashlight super hot and they die very quickly!!! I can go through the 4 batteries within an 8 hour work day. I’m not using the flashlight the entire 8 hours but I do use it quite often. I recently just purchased a flashlight that uses true 3.7v cell LI-ion batteries. The AA 1.5v LI-ion are not really AA batteries. They are smaller 3.7v LI-ion batteries with a AA housing that use circuitry to convert 3.7v to 1.5v. The conversion naturally consumes energy that could otherwise be used by the device and the circuitry takes up space. Would not recommend. Maybe for a remote control for the TV.

With NiMH rechargeable batteries; because of 1.35 volt instead of 1.5 volt. Even at full 100% of charged; you'll get around 90% then it will slowly goes down to 80% with very long lasting light per charge. With this new 1.5 continue voltage level throughout the charge that will make Cree LED flashlight at the fullest brightness even this batteries is at the 10% left in charged until BMS built-into each battery will cut-off.

  No one seems to have noticed the neatest thing about these batteries.  They charge directly with 5V.  The charger that comes with them isn't a charger, it's just a 5V splitter.  The charger is built into the battery, which explains why the charge light is on the battery itself.  That's why they don't work in any other charger, and no other batteries work in this 'charger'.  This is similar to all the other USB-plug lithium batteries for sale, but without taking the space for a socket or plug they can fit more capacity in these batteries.  In the attached photo you can see that each battery can be charged separately, each drawing 500mA.  Since 5V USB power is ubiquitous and I don't have to worry about the charger breaking I feel comfortable getting more of these.

The longevity on a charge is very noticeable in the peripherals I've been using them in (bluetooth Xbox controller and WMR wands which can be finicky with batteries). They perform well beyond anything I've tried prior and charge consistently fast.

Rechargeable Lithium with consistent 1.5 V !
","

  Been wanting to try these rechargeable Lithium and recently they've dropped down in price enough for me to try them out.  These batteries are the same size as regular alkaline, some rechargeable batteries are larger than regular alkalines which do cause problems in some devices.I'm using these in my paintball hopper and they are performing great! I didn't use rechargeable in the past because I was concerned they weren't putting out enough power.Will post an updated review if I notice they start failing or charges deteriorate significantly over time.

  My 2 sons go through batteries like you wouldn't believe.. I wanted to get some reachargeable batteries, so I ordered these. So far, they are working great.  They fully charge in about 90 minutes and appear to be high-capacity.  They last for a long time before having to be reacharged again. So much better than the old NiCad rechargeables - these are lithium and last much longer.  I also really like that they can charge via USB cord - this makes it easy to charge them as we have lots of other USB devices.  I'm pretty happy with the purchase so far...  They claim to last for 1,000 cycles, I guess we will see.

  I put two of these batteries in my good Craftsman LED flashlight and after barely a minute of use the color of the light shifted from pure white to like a purplish hue and I saw what looked like small wisps of smoke or something coming off the head of the flashlight. I took them out immediately since I was afraid they might explode or start on fire. There's also a dark spot in the center of the flashlight beam now like part of the LED burned out or something. Don't waste your money on these. They'll wreck your devices and cost you a ton of money replacing whatever it is or they'll just start a fire and your house will burn down.

  I bought the 4-battery TENAVOLTS rechargeable lithium batteries for my Oculus Rift controllers - they had previously been eating through AA batteries like crazy, and my miscellaneous 5-??? year old NiCd batteries weren't holding a charge anymore. I was surprised to see lithium in rechargeable AA batteries - I don't know much about batteries but people were saying good things about them. Anyways, here's what matters:PROS:+ Super easy to use. Plug into computer USB port (I think it says not to use an outlet), pop batteries into the convenient little carrying case, wait for blue light to go off. Tadah - charged.+ Long-lasting. I was surprised, since my previous rechargeable batteries got eaten up by my controllers. These guys last me a week or two of high-intensity Beat Saber before I have to swap to the other pair.+ Comes with carrying case. I've lost so many rechargeable batteries I can't keep count of them. These guys come with a little box for you to leave your batteries in, which helps me keep track of them.CONS:- Charging cable is super short. The included charging cable is maybe 8 inches long, so you can't really leave the charger away on your desk somewhere. It also doesn't seem to work for other devices. That being said, this is a really minor gripe.Overall, I really like these batteries. If for some weird reason I end up using other AA-powered electronics in the future, I'll probably be getting more of these.

  I have a lot of flashlights, for some reason I can't seem to get enough flashlights. And with those flashlights I want to drive them and make them as bright as possible, hence why I purchased these batteries. A lot of my rechargeable batteries drain too quickly, doesn't fully provide the 1.5V or take too long to charge. Regular disposable AA works great, but a bit wasteful. Overall, I've had these for a while and I love them. I will purchase more for the rest of my AA devices (mainly flashlights!)Battery Size: I've included some pictures of the batteries compared to AA Amazon basic disposable and AA Amazon basic Rechargeable. These are actually almost identical to the regular AA and smaller than the Amazon Basic rechargeable. Buyer should be aware of the size difference in case they have limited space, not all AA are the exact same size.

  Sweet, lithium rechargeable batteries. I have lots of battery operated flashlights.I also own lots of NIMJ rechargeable batteries they all output 1.2 volts these Tenergy Lithium rechargeable batteries output 1.5volts. Some devices are sensitive to voltage and NIMH batteries may not work. One example is a flashlight I own which is dim with NIMH. I had been using single use lithium batteries which are expensive and get thrown away.I also like the case / charger. I did notice it charges at 500mA and no option for 200mA although it looks like you can use a NIMH charger to charge these and Choi’s 200mA.  Generally charging at lower mA means more cycles. Longer total life. The charger also has slots for AAA which they don’t seem to make but hopefully they doAnd soon.

  Some of my devices require alot of power & others just need consistent power. And we all know, everyone uses batteries for at least tv remotes & wireless computer mice, so why not use rechargeable batteries. They are cost effective & can be recharged a 1000 times over.The devices I use that need consistent voltage are my remote controlled devices, such as rc transmitters & rc vehicles.These 760mah lithium rechargeable batteries will last just as long as my 2800mah NiMH rechargeable batteries if not better. With my NiMH, as the battery drains, the voltage drops, and makes motors sluggish. Lithium batteries maintain a constant voltage & have no memory effect. One thing I have learned is to make sure to only charge lithium batteries with the charger they came with, as they have special circuitry inside.As these batteries are a recent advancement in technology, they should become more readily available in different sizes in the near future.Overall, these are excellent AA batteries that come with their own charger which also acts as a storage case.

Surprisingly Good - Normal Price Way Too High
","

  I bought these at a deep discount from Amazon. I have since used them in a couple of applications: (a) a beard trimmer and (b) a BT->Infrared adapter. I have had great success with both. The full 1.5v delivered runs the beard trimmer motor faster than with a 1.2v Eneloop. And even faster, it seems, than an alkaline. The adapter seems to monitor voltage as it judges when its batteries are dead and with these, that happens far less quickly than with 1.2v Eneloop. Not idea in all applications, I am sure - especially trickle use like clocks. But for flashlights, motors, and others they seem quite good. Two caveats: (a) when these are emptied out, they go from full-power to zero-power immediately. There is no warning period. (b) You MUST use the included charger - you cannot charge them in other chargers. At the regular retail price I would not likely buy more. But when the price drops down to where I got mine originally, I will definitely buy more.

  I have gone through many different sets of batteries for my WMR controllers until someone suggested me these batteries. I didn't believe him at first until I bought them and have never had an issue since! All my older batteries would give a low battery warnung after 30 minutes of using the controller and I used to think it was just a software issue or a WMR issue and ignored it and was ok with the battery life. These batteries are on a whole different level. They have a circuit that keeps them consistent at 1.5 volts and when you charge them they individually have a little led on the negative end to tell you that its charging. Overall highly recommended for WMR users who just want to play their games and not worry about controller life anymore

  This is my initial review, I'll post updates after I test them out.Voltage comparison: (fresh of package, not charged up yet)Duracell: 1.54vEneloop: 1.35vNi-Zn: 1.71vTenavolts (Li-ion poly): 1.51vI wanted batteries close to 1.5v because some of the electronics don't like the 1.3-1.35 volts of NiMHand each of the different chemical types of batteries perform differently in situations, I'll report back.Yes, there are better Ni-Zn (or at least more expensive) out there, but I'm going for the best bang for the buck.I'm giving this all stars until proven otherwise.

Excellent...more power than most
","

  I am very happy with this purchase.  I think this puts out 1.5v which is a little higher than most so I get the maximum power.  I'm using them in an electric razor and I've been using them for about a month on a single charge.  No sign of needing to recharge soon.  Things like remote controls or other slow draining devices might not need this kind of battery but if you're replacing batteries every few weeks, this is an excellent choice.Only negative--I got it on sale so maybe the regular price is a little high.

  These batteries do their job very well for the most part. The charge lasts well compared to other rechargable batteries that these compete with. The only main concerns for these batteries are that they can only be recharged with the charging platform that came with the batteries and that the microUSB cable that came with the platform was really small, making it hard to keep charging on an outlet.

Also when i took the Tenavolt batteries out after 2 test fires, the contacts on both sides almost burnt my finger.Maybe, I am missing some new technology, but the manufacturer does not mention that this battery has a capacity of only 760 mAh!!I ended up returning this. not worth the money, performance loss, or fire risk.

  These fail after 10 pops in a camera flash (and their promo video specifically showed a photographer using a flash with great results).  They just stop working, and need to go back to the charger.  Tried 4 sets with same results.  Something is wrong with the voltage and calibration in high drain devices.  I've heard from others that these have a very small window of products they will work well in.  So, I wouldn't use them in anything critical, but maybe they'll be good for the tv remote.

  So far these batteries are working much better in my Apple wireless trackpad when compared to using NiMh rechargeable batteries.  I have only gone through 3 cycles so far but the Tenavolts last about 10 days longer.  After a few more cycles I would expect the difference to be even larger.  The Tenavolts as expected run until they don't.  In other words they maintain 1.5 volts until the end when they stop.  This is compared to the NiMh batteries where the voltage goes down over time and slowly fail.  We will see how many cycles the Tenavolts are good for as I am tracking every cycle that each battery goes through and will update as my testing goes on.  But so far very happy with the performance.  A little bit expensive but if they perform as described by the manufacturer they may well be worth it.

I checked the cell voltages, and of the four, two read 1.5 volts and the other two read 0.9 volts. So although the flash puts the four cells in series, the batteries were not sharing the load amongst themselves, and two discharged more than the other two. I recharged all four and put a pair in a Maglite, which quit after eight minutes.This product is a nice idea that isn’t working out in practice.

  I have bought other rechargeable batteries, both with and without chargers, but no charger I have has this individual port charging feature. Fast charging, love the red/green light indicator for each port, doesn't hog the wall outlet, charges all my rechargeable batteries. Put the EBL type in my tv remote, am curious to see how long they last before needing recharged compared to the others I have.

Simple and easy to use

  This is a battery charger with 8 bays. The device measures approximately 5”x3”1”. It has a single port on side, USB micro for power. It ships with a USB A to USB micro power cable, but no transformer. The charger has 8 bays. Each bay can hold either 1 AA battery or 1 AAA battery. Above each bay is an LED that lights red while charging and green when finished.I find this charger very simple to use. Just plug it into a USB A power source such as a USB A transformer brick (not included) and load it up. I have a flashlight that I like to use every day, but it runs down batteries after just an hour or so of use. So rechargeables are the only way to go with that flashlight. The light takes 3 AAA batteries, which can be rather inconvenient to charge in a small charger that only does 2 batteries at once. With this 8-bay charger, I can charge up all 3 batteries at once and then some. The first time I used the charger, I was a little confused since the AAA batteries seem to fit funny. Finally, I realized that they go on a slight slant in the charger, and that the fit is perfect. Overall, this is a handy charger to have, especially when you need to charge more than 2 batteries at once.

  I generally like EBL products, having their AC 8 battery charger and a bunch of their batteries.  So when I saw this I jumped on it, but didn't realize it was USB based, meaning you need a separate high power charger to run it.  That makes it nice to have as a spare if I need to charge a few extra batteries, but not ideal.  I certainly don't think it's as fast as the AC powered unit.  I just think it should mention USB in the item title, as I certainly don't think USB charger when dealing with AA rechargeables!

  Worked as described. When I loaded it with anything from 1 - 8 batteries, all charged with no issue.New EBL AA 2800mWh batteries that did not come precharged took about 2 hours to fully charge. I use a high powered USB charger (2.4A) and high quality micro USB cable to feed this unit to ensure that I don’t choke it when 8 batteries are demanding power. Near the end of the charge cycle, heat was present on the batteries. As they fully charged, l removed them from the charger to let them cool down.

I was extremely impressed by how well it worked.  I will give the manufacturer credit that they do specify that there is no AC plug included.  I was still a bit shocked by that, but it wasnt anything that was an issue.  I used my Aukey USB wall chager (which i also highly recommend )https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013US9FFY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1it let me know which batteries were bad as we have 3 kids and had about 20 batteries total...blinking red light = bad battery...solid red = charging.  It automatically shuts off when done and just displays green led.  I cannot speak for other NiMH battery manufacturers as I only purchased and charged Energizer brand, but it works great for them (8 at a time btw as I saw other reviews saying it wouldnt do that)  Hope this helps

  This EBL AA AAA Battery Charger - 8 Bay Individual Battery Charger with 5V 2A Fast Charging Function is perfect for our needs. We use a lot of motion sensor button lights around the house, and heavily use AAA batteries. I was buying non-rechargeables for awhile, but felt bad tossing so many (recycled, but still). I got rehargeables instead, and this charger effectively powers the batteries up overnight. It might charge sooner, but I leave them in there till the next day, and they are always ready. I've seen no degradation of my batteries over the month I've used this, and am pleased with the product.

  I have used this a handful of times to charge my AA and AAA batteries. I haven’t tried more than 4 at a time. That’s because if I wait, I won’t have any charged batteries to use in my devices.The good news is that it can charge several batteries of different sizes at once. It can even charge only one at a time. My other chargers won’t do that. It has indicator lights that tell you when it is charging and indicate when it is finished.What I don’t like is that it is USB and did not come with its own USB cable.

Decent rechargeable batteries
","

  Use them for my Roku Ultra remote. Before when I was using regular disposable Duracells & I would go through the batteries within 3 to 4 days. These last a little over a week before they hit the 10% mark in my Roku Ultra remote. They take a few hours to charge up. They did not come fully pre-charged so it took a while to charge them. A small flaw I noticed was after fully charging the batteries & took them off the charger to put them away in storage & tried them they were at 52%. They appear to loose charge even when idle & not hooked up to anything. So it looks like you gotta keep them on the charger & the charger plugged in at all times if you want fully charged batteries.Also, the green fully charged indicator light is flawed. It doesn't indicate a full charge at 100%, just when it hits at around 70 to 75% making it nearly impossible to determine if the batteries are fully charged to 100%. I can determine this through my Roku remote in settings where it shows battery percentage but most other AA/AAA powered devices don't have this luxury. Other than these flaws I’m glad I went with these instead of the Energizer rechargables. Decent for the price I guess.

  **Edit - My original review is below the line. I've updated my rating to 3 stars because the seller stands behind their products & issued a full refund after we discussed the issues. Based on their service, I guess it's possible I may have gotten a couple bad sets. I don't think I'll be trying them again but, if you decide to, at least you know the seller will address any issues promptly & work with you to make it right, unlike so many others these days. That's worth a couple stars in my book.-----I wish I could leave NO stars! I guess the the charger itself make qualify for the ONE star. It appears well made & is easy to use. It lights up with red or green status lights to show battery levels, & batteries charged in it test as full upon removal..BUT, the included batteries are ABSOLUTE JUNK! >:(I even bought the big case of batteries made by this company at the same time & have ONLY used their charger for them but they're worthless too.They register as charged but just CANNOT hold a charge!  They're useless!They claim they'll work for high demand devices but just my programmable thermostat kept registering low battery after less than a day when I switched to these batteries.After months of dealing with what I assumed to be a faulty thermostat, I actually had it replaced.It never occurred to me, based on the great reviews & seller claims, that EVERY ONE of the batteries in this package, as well as the many batteries that came with their case, could be ALL be bad.THEY ARE! >:(I replaced the thermostat yet STILL had the same problem!!!A store run just for batteries isn't exactly a great idea right now, so I resorted to using my old rechargables (made by a different company) a few days ago. They'd been sitting in my camera for almost a year yet they worked fine! It's been 3 days & not a single low battery notice or issue -  with used batteries that sat in a camera, maintaining its picture count, etc. for almost year!  Yet these brand new batteries couldn't manage to power it for a full 24 hours - usually not even 12 hours!!I'm happy that I know the REAL problem has been these horrible batteries, but also VERY angry! >:(I bought this charger & their case with batteries less than 7 months ago!I followed their instructions. I charged them all with ONLY the charger made for them. I've properly stored them in their case since. I did everything right here, yet they still just don't work!They SHOULD have at least some charge left to them, especially the triple As & others that haven't been used at all or had only been charged one additional time. NOPE!! >:(I just tested them ALL & EVERY SINGLE ONE, from this set & the case set, is completely drained!Don't waste your money if you want batteries that actually work!!

  These batteries will drain even with no use over the period of a couple of days! I will never buy the EBL brand again. I purchased them on two separate occasions, thought the first was a bad batch, apparently not. Save your money, buy another brand!!!The charger with It is ok, though a little slow.EDIT:08-07-20 The manufacturer recommended to charge and discharge these batteries 3 times to build their capacity, so I went out and bought the BT-C2400 Battery Charger / Analyzer, great device btw. I followed the manufacturers instructions and went through the discharge refresh cycle on the analyzer. The mAh on these batteries was rated at 2800, the highest I got was 2135 on one out of 12 batteries, most were around half of rated value. Once again after 4 weeks on the shelf I got values from .29v to 1.27v. These batteries are absolutely USELESS. RUN from these EBT batteries. DO NOT waste your money. Also I had commented that the charger wasn’t so bad, well after getting a real charger I realize just how bad the provided charger was. It’s as bad as the batteries. The seller sent me replacement batteries in case the ones I had were defective, which was a wonderful thing to do, but those were just as bad. Quite frankly The Amazon Bacics rechargeables are a much better battery and therefore a much better buy. Thanks for the support EBT but this product is not up to quality standards set by other foreign brands.

Great at first, but slowly dwindled.

  After having these batteries for a few years now, I can say that they aren't the best. At first when I got them they seemed fine, but after only a couple months I found some of the batteries had swollen so much that they'd no longer fit in my lights. I'd have to use pliers to remove the batteries from stuff, so I'd have to throw those ones away. The ones that didn't swell just don't really hold a charge anymore. I can  charge them, have green lights, and then use them and they die in a matter of minutes. The company reached out to me to offer a replacement a couple years back which was awesome, but in order to get the replacement I had to send in all the batteries which I couldn't do since I had thrown some away. They were cheap, and they got the job done for the most part over the years, but now they are practically worthless and I'm looking for other brands to replace them with.

  The batteries work great, my problem is the charger. It seems to charge batteries fine but the indicator lights are always green. If I put the batteries in dead the corresponding light remains solid green. As a result I have to let them charge overnight to be sure they're full. An annoyance but they do work great.EDIT- Yesterday I charged batteries again with the charger and it appears that the indicator lights worked as they should, red-orange at first then green a few hours later, the batteries charged. J don't know why the first time it didn't work yet now it does. I'll need to test it further, but I'm going up to 5 stars since it seems to be working now. (The company also reached out to me-good customer service. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again)Last review- again the charger isn't working. I put 2 batteries in it last night. 16+ hours later the indicator light is still red. I'm not convinced that the charger works as it should if at all. The batteries themselves seem to work great

Don't hold charge, and don't deliver rated capacity.
","

  I've bought a variety of rechargeable batteries from Amazon.  Most work fairly well, and deliver pretty much their rated capacity.  The three Amazon branded varieties work well with the Blacks working the best.  Of all the batteries I've purchased the EBL's have been terrible performers.  They rarely deliver the rated capacity even from the day of first charge.  They don't hold a charge when sitting in a drawer for very long.  After 30 days after a full charge they drop to half capacity and in most cases won't light a flashlight they've been put in.  After one year of use (about 20 charges) they  only deliver about 60%  of the downrated capacity they had from day one.  I should have noted the country of origin.  They are made in China and based on performance I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  All the rechargeables I've purchased those that were made in Japan work great, deliver their rated capacity, hold a charge sitting in a drawer for three times as long as any EBL battery and continue to deliver 95/97 % of rated capacity after one year.  For those that are curious I use a MH-C9000 Powerex WizardONe charger-analyzer to charge the my batteries, check their capacities and use the refresh mode every ten or so usage cycles to bring them back to maximum capacity.  I just purchased my 2nd MH-C9000 charger as a gift for my DIY brother and he is also thrilled with the unit.

Battery diameter is too large.  (Updated review below)

  The batteries are slightly larger in diameter than normal AAs. So, they would not seat properly in my appliance. When batteries are in sequence they rely on the spring at the negative terminal to keep them connected.  I had no such problem with the Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries. However the charger works very well.UPDATE:The Seller promptly contacted me and explained that the extra capacity (2800) required a slightly larger battery diameter.  They solved the problem by sending a set of 2300 batteries that fit perfectly.  I am happy.  I changed the rating from 2 to 5 stars.

  EDIT:  I have used the batteries in other products - some were a bit snug but just as I expected they worked fine.  They may not work for small products that may have tight battery areas.  I will point out that the company has contacted me twice about this.  I assured them the first time that I was happy with the product overall and was sure I could use them elsewhere.  However they contacted me again to offer me a full refund or a replacement.  I wrote them back and told them I wanted neither as I can use the batteries, as they are for other products just fine, and certainly did not feel I need to be compensated for such a minor issue.I updated this review from a 3-star (I did not know it was a 3 star I thought it was a 4) to a 5 as I am very happy with the product.  I hope this will let them know that :).I hope this helps future, prospective purchasers.The batteries will probably work well with many products, however, the one we bought them for they do not.  My wife has a globe that uses three AA batteries to throw the ""snow stuff"" around.  It eats batteries fairly fast.  Unfortunately, these batteries had to be pushed very hard to fit.  In so doing they do not move at all in the holder.  So the spring cannot push them up to make good contact.  I had to go buy regular batteries anyway.

Read many different product reviews on Amazon and this looked the most promising and I'm so happy I went with this one.

  We've bought some other EBL sized re-chargeable batteries and these seem to be great value for the $$$. I can't attest to how many times they'll charge up before no longer able to do so, but after even 3 or 4 times they've already paid for themselves several times over, and if we only get a year's worth of charging this was well worth it.

Lower Battery Cost in the Long Run, and Won't Leak and Ruin Devices

  I have purchased EBL batteries and chargers in the past and have no regrets about the purchases. The costs of the batteries and charger are reasonable, and the products work well. I have elected to convert to NiMh batteries wherever possible, and have purchased adapters for using AA batteries for C and D size applicatons. In the long run, battery cost will be greatly reduced and NiMh batteries don't leak and corrode like alkaline batteries which can and have ruined battery powered devices.

  I freaking LOVE these chargers. I have push lights in my micro kitchen, lights lining my fence outside, and currently, my Christmas tree. The batteries last forever. I could get a couple of weeks on the lights for the kitchen with a standard AA battery, but with the rechargeables, I get more than a month. They are remarkably long-lasting. From drained to fully charged, it takes a couple of hours. I'm going to buy another set for my Apple keyboard and mouse because everyone knows that the batteries in those two die in zero time and it's really, really annoying... Highly recommend.

Great for Flash Photography
","

  I was really impressed by the quality of the batteries, as well as the charger. I am a nightclub and event photographer and use lots of batteries for my flash. One set of four batteries lasted in my Canon 470RT flash on ETTL for a full 2 and a half hours. I noticed once or twice having to turn off and back on because of how high drain the flash is. I know this because I sat and fired 50+ full 1/1 flashes when I first got the batteries and it never had to “charge” the flash. So when IT said “charging” after shooting for five minutes I just turned off and on it went straight back to firing no problem.The box it came in is somewhat vacant of information. And the instructions were written in broken English. But no complaints! The batteries do NOT get hot when they charge as others have said.Really great deal. So far it’s been a high quality product and great purchase in my book.

Wonderful charger
","

  It charges not only AA batteries but also AAA batteries, there are also two USB ports that can be used simultaneously when charging your batteries. The charger comes with 8-AA batteries that were not charged, so I charged them, it took about 1 hr 45 minutes to completely charge.  It also comes with a cord and an instruction booklet that is very easy to read and understand and is in 5 different languages .  When charging if the  your battery is not charged the led lights above the battery will show red and when fully charged will show green.  There are 4 led lights, one light for two batteries, when charging use the same size batteries under each light.  The size of the unit is 7.5 inches length, 3.8 inches width and 1,2 inches height,  and it weighs 6 ounces.  Since I have charged the batteries I have been using them in an old cd player and they are awesome been playing for 5 hours non-stop and they are still going strong. The batteries come in little case that snap shut which I love no more batteries all over the drawer.  These batteries are  ProCyco technology - EBL batteries can be recharged up to 1200 times when fully or partially drained,  Improved low self discharge makes it still maintain 80% of capacity after 3 year of non-use.  Batteries come pre-charged and can be used immediately out of the package but mine wasn't charged but that was no big deal since I got the charger.  You can use these batteries in household devices such as digital cameras, toys, remote controls, hand held games, flashlights ,alarm-clocks, portable audio players and any other item that uses AA or AAA batteries.I highly recommend this product it is very high quality and if you have any problems they tell you to contact them and give a URL to reach them in the instruction booklet.

So freaking awesome. We are already using some of the batteries. I like that you can charge AA or AAA batteries with this.I did read where it says don't mix battery sizes in one indicator section...so keep that in mind. I'm looking forward to saving a lot of money on batteries.I also like that the batteries come in a thick and sturdy container.

  got this on the 15th, charged up AA batteries overnight to ensure full charge. Put two in my MAC trackpad and now 10 days later I get low battery warning. I put another set in that was fully charged and and have been sitting in the box for the last 10 days and they are registering only 83% charged.  Very disappointed.  I got these because i was tired of replacing the name brand copper top batteries every couple months.  These have to be replaced and recharged every two weeks for this device?  Nope, I dont recommend them based on that.  I dont know how many times they can really be recharged and how degraded the performance will be as time goes on.update 4/3/2018(one week later) the batteries in my trackpad are now at 17%.  mind you this is a very low consumption device and these batteries have lost 70% of their charge in just one week.  By comparison, my keyboard has copper-tops in it which have been in there for about 6 weeks and still show 100% charge.

I travel internationally and bought it specifically because it appeared that it could be used in North America as well as in Europe, Asia, etc. I'll have to return it.Update (2/14/201): The vendor changed the description to say that the charger operates on 100-120V, which is correct.

  Ok I took a chance on this product. It has great reviews but I’ve never heard of them personally.  I can’t believe the bang for buck I got from this charger and batteries.

  I’ve used these for about 6 weeks. I use the AA for decorative led string lights that turn on automatically every night for 6 hrs. The AA last much longer in the lights than Energizer; however, they take about 8hrs  to charge. I think this is because the charger uses a USB cord (included) with an adapter(not included). I tried an Apple charger but it got too warm. I’m using an Amazon surge protector outlet/USB  and that is doing fine. I plan on buying another pack of AA on my next Amazon order. Until then I’m just alternating the 2 lights. Overall, very good performance. I can run the lights for 42hrs on one charge. That’s about 2xs longer than rechargeable Energizers. (I always recycle all my recharge batteries every Christmas). I hope to get 1 yr of charges out of these. I’ll let ya’ll know in Dec.

  I purchased these 9V lithium batteries for my camera and now it last for a week and still working well , these are one of best rechargeable I used for my camera, it will keep work in my camera untill the end of their capacity.Highly recommended for items that need a lot of current with little resistance.

  I love the new design for these batteries, they are able to be charged by USB. I had to bring a battery charger with me for my electric guitar when I go out before. Now I only need to bring a cable. This pack includes a 4 in 1 usb cable so all 4 batteries can be charged all at once,it is very convenient to charge.

Best 9V Rechargeable Batteries
","

  Just what I was looking for. I was considering buying a rechargeable battery to replace the old 9V for my smoke alarm, but I don't have the alone 9V charger, then I found this USB rechargeable 9V battery, what a wonderful charging design!!The rechargeable lithium ion battery and the micro usb cable charging are the reasons I purchase for this product. I don't have to buy a stand alone charger just plug this into my computer or power bank and 1-2 hours later I have a full charge battery.So far it worked well and fit perfectly in my smoke, so if you having doubt about them fitting in your electronics it's the same size as the standard alkaline 9V.

  I really love these batteries, these are not any old type of rechargeable batteries, it is the best 9V batteries I had used.

  Though this was a good product until I finished charging them. Used on battery on my razor and it lasted for barely 10mins before dying. I didn't use the charger that came with it since I wanted only one battery at the time and just used a single micro USB. I charged it over night as well before using it.

  These came dead, so, I followed the instructions and charged them for 6 hours, as per directions. I put them in a hair trimmer and it ran EXTREMELY slow, getting slower as I shaved. I tried the 2nd pair and they were almost dead also. Good idea, but DEFINITELY NOT PRACTICAL AT THE COST OF 4 DOLLARS PER BATTERY.""WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN""

  The convenience of these is undeniable. So far though, I can't tell if they are fully charged. I would expect the red LED to change to green but that doesn't happen... it stays red as long as the batter is on the charger. I'm using the batteries in an xbox controller and so far, they seem to last.

  Great product - the batteries come with their own built in battery charger via micro USB AND the battery Charge level indicator as well. This means you ONLY charge when they need a charge - and can be charged from almost any USB power supply - like your portable phone charger OR Power brick. If you travel a lot - it is GAME OVER for ever needing to buy ANY battery at ridiculous Airport prices :)

A bit too high on the Voltage, but very steady.
","

  Comparing to a couple of other brands of LI-Ion AA cells, which read 1.49 to 1.51 volts, these AAA batteries are a bit high at 1.66 to 1.67 volts.  This actually matters in some equipment, especially when only in single or double battery configurations.  I have put these to use in application of 3 or more batteries, mixed with a couple of NiMH batteries, which allows for a voltage boost that doesn't overload the circuit.  The high voltage (for whatever reason) really affected some sound-dampening headphones, which caused me to first believe that there was a problem with the headphones.  Turns out, just a bit too much voltage.  But, this does help with mixing into my collection of NiMH, as they sometimes fall just a bit short in the voltage requirement department.  Mixing makes it just right.
