  Unit is a small swamp cooler unfortunately too small to be effective for any area would need to be at least double in size to be effective. Fan speed would also need to be increased by at least twice.

  This is a very small, weak fan... the filter in cool water, put in fridge feature doesn't work.  This is nothing more than a gimmacky way to pretend its an upgrade over a fan, and its not.  pay 1/3 of this, and get an oscillating, more powerful fan... and not something that holds like 16 ounces of water and pretends to be more than it is.

Perfect fan cooler for my desk
","

  I've had a few personal coolers before and they always leaked or had an issue when using it within the first week, I even bought an evapolar before and it looked great but it gave me issues from the getgo so I had to return it. This one looked awesome in the photos and also had good reviews so I got it. From its box to the air flow, this was a great surprise. It has 2 speeds but it has wider coverage than the pervious coolers I had. The filter is removable so I stick it in the fridge at night so in the morning when the sun is directly on my window, it gives me a cooler breeze (don't put it in freeze cuz it will just freeze). Just note.. THIS WILL NOT COOL YOUR ROOM! I saw the bad reviews but this is just for 5 feet or less so be prepared. If you decide on getting it, you'll appreciate it!

  Save your money. It’s not very powerful and is barely as strong as a standard small fan and for more money than a fan. Also well designed but very cheap looking and the top cover for the filter is already broken after a day of use, can’t close it fully. Did the optional steps of putting the filter in the fridge and putting water in the machine, no noticeable improvement. Don’t buy this, buy a large fan instead.

Brizer evaporative cooler

  I love this product you can freeze the filter, which is very high quality. It's small and compact and a child could operate easily. My central ac system didn't get my man cave cold upstairs enough, even with a ceiling fan and an air purifier running it was still few degrees too warm to properly cool me and my gear properly. This unit solved that and my hallway is even colder, this little cube keeps my 14'x14' man cave perfect temp now I'm comfortable and my giant 4k tv and gear is working alot better because it's not overheating. Don't buy those cheap 20-50 dollar evaporative coolers, they suck . This $60 unit does exactly what you'll need on office desk or like I have it on my mini fridge. You'll get 4-6° cooler and cleaner air to boot

  This is just a very low powered swamp cooler. They use these in Arizona for houses, only bigger. This thing is basically a low powered fan that blows mildly cooler air at you.

  A personal AC unit that cools you down. It doesn't cool like a real ac but cools you down and it's perfect at doing that. It's only a little noisy so it's not annoying and adding cold water to the reservoir makes it so much more effective. You can also add some essential oil to filter heads if you want added bonus of great calming smell, just don't put TOO much. It can get very strong.

  I'm not sure why people are saying it's quiet. The fan control has no effect in cool mode. When you set the fan on low and adjust the temperature the fan automatically switches to high as if on auto which makes it too loud for a bedroom. There's also an obnoxious vibration happening with the covers. I have to wedge a towel between the cover and the floor to get it to stop. The unit is level so it's not a leveling issue.

  I have used this all summer almost 24/7 and my electric bill has only gone up an average of $9.00 per month. It works well for a bedroom, I've never had to empty anything or any complications. It was also very easy to set up. It does do a thing at night where it turns to fan mode then switches back to AC mode in intervals that are loud enough to wake me up and I do notice the rise in temperature between switching on and off in AC mode, and I am not sure if that is something that is controllable or not.

Almost better than nothing
","

  Before we begin, this is a 2.5 star rating.  I couldnt bring myself to give it a 2 cause it works, but a 3 is just too kind.Lets get the good out of the way.1.  Its better than NOT having an air-conditioner.  We've had some really hot days lately and knowing we can retreat to the bedroom where its cooler (not cold) is a godsend.  Also makes sleeping at night easier.2. Once you've set it up once, its a breeze to take down and put up again (in that same area).  And the rolling wheels make the heavy unit someone easy to push around.3. Go out the back and feel the hot air coming out, its like a hair dryer set to medium.So now after using this for 1 year I have A LOT of design issues with this.1.  You can't set it to just ON, full blast.  It'll cycle periodically on/off which creates a large clunking noise, and since its in our bedroom wakes us up.2.  Jesus Christ the blue lights on the display illuminate the whole bedroom at night with a bright blue glow.  And yet somehow  if you walk up to the display at night you cant see any of the buttons to change settings.You will end up covering the display with something its just too bright at night3. The water drain is 1-inch from the ground.  So water doesn't drain unless your using a McDonald's tray to catch water.  Raise the unit up you say? well its on wheels and will easily fall and crush you.So to empty the water you periodically will to a 80 pound deadlift and wait for the water to drain.  Brilliant.4.  The lowest temperature setting is 64F ?!?!  Thats like 17C, thats not cold ! that's just below ambient temperature.  I want icicles coming off my unit or its not cold enough especially when advertised as 14000 BTU.5.  I think its added about 150$ / month to my electricity bill on heavily used months...thats a lot for slightly cooling down one room only.I know these stand alone units aren't great and have many design flaws and physical limitations.  But I just cant recommend this after having it for a year.  I am glad I have something to help on hot days but if I had to do it again I would consider a different option, though it may not be much better either.

  I previously had a 10,000 BTU portable AC. To replace, I went with this highest model, the 14000 btu/ 11000 heat. It does pretty well, so far. When I turn it on max it turns my little apartment into a polar cap. I personally opted for the higher end model so I wouldn't have to run it on high all the time. I figure that running an AC on low rather than high extends the overall lifetime of the compressor.I turned it on the heating mode once to test it out and it seemed to push out some decent BTU's. Since it's August it will be a while before I can test that function.I really wish the remote control had a backlight function, like a little button that you could toggle the backlight on the LED on/off. It's really annoying having to search for a flashlight in the middle of the night just to change the remote settings.When running on max AC mode there is considerable moisture condensation build-up on the top near the touch-buttons, which is worrying. I have to wipe it off every 6 hours.Otherwise, it runs very well and I appreciate that it had the casters pre-installed. The cord was shorter than other previous portable AC units I have used.The hose included should have been insulated, it's just a plastic hose. The heat dissipation from that does not help. For a nearly 500 dollar unit, I would have appreciated an insulated hose.Overall 4/5 stars.

  Bought this unit to replace a LG I has bought early this year but it was just not cooling the room.  My first impression is how compact the unit is - 2/3 the size of the LG, but not only has 4000BTU more, this one also provides heat (untested, too hot yet in AZ).  Set the unit up, turned it on, and room temp dropped 2 degrees in 15 minutes!This unit effectively cools my Arizona room, lots of windows, minimal insulation, against the Arizona heat.  It has been over 110 for over a month and not projected to go down soon.  (Probably what did the LG in)When it was running, I had to check to be sure it had the fan on high because it was so quiet!  (1/4 of the noise level of the LG on medium!)Set up was easy and straight forward and I did not have any problems with the unit.My room is cool - I set the unit at 78 and it is able to maintain that temperature against the (current 118 degrees outside).I strongly recommend this unit.

  So first of all this unit works great there is one problem though. Before buying this unit make sure your home doesn't have a super old power box and by old i mean the one the house had installed when it was built. If you have an outdated power box this unit will blow hot air for like. 3-5 minutes then youll see the lights flicker before it starts blowing super cold air again.

5000 btu, not 8000
","

  I wanted badly to like this as it seemed so convenient to roll in and hook up.First I learnt the 8000  BTU advertised was ashrae, and it was comparative to only a 5000 doe BTU window unit.  So right from the start you're not getting what you paid for.  it says 5000 BTU in large letters on the box but no place on Amazon was it mentioned that the 8000  was a different type of  BTU measurement. So one would assume it was 8000 BTU but you're getting only  5000. Its not exceptionally loud . but is loud. (yes, you will have to turn the TV up if watching it) but the on and off during the night will wake you every time it kicks on or off. It does cool well.  I ran it 2 weeks, trying to like it and to see if i would adjust to the nightly wake ups. I didn't,  the lights are bright enough you will likely want to cover them, I simply laid a cloth across them to block it out. I calculated my electric usage. It increased my bill approximately $60 per month over the window unit.I had no problem with the hook ups and it was a fairly simple install.. But the price to run coupled with the continual  wake ups during the nights from the noise make it a no go.  Sorry Amazon  but this ones going back, I do not recommend this.

  Works great in my small room. The house AC can’t keep up with the house and my room is the biggest with one vent, and two windows. This portable AC is perfect. It has a loud-ish noise when it goes from full to low but it’s not bad at all with over all noise level. I love the remote also. My windows are at a high level so I had to get a longer vent tube.

  Just what I needed! I ordered this in at the beginning of summer and I’m so happy I did it. Firstly, props to the Amazon delivery guys, two of them hauled this beast up two flights of stairs and didn’t leave it by the mail area! So thanks for that!!! I read in other reviews that you’re supposed to let it stands upright for 24 hours before you even plug it in - so I did that. I’m a women in her twenties & I was fully able to set up the window tube thingy. Our bill has not gone up drastically, mostly because I run it only when the heat is simply unbearable. I don’t use the fan option much, I’ve used the dehumidifier a couple of times but mostly I rely on the air conditioner option to cool down my room. I really love this AC, since the summers are only going to get warmer and warmer because of global warming, I am really glad I purchase this to have when the heat gets bad in the summers in California!

  This unit provides very good cold air and does what I need it to do.  Out of the box, the control were not working properly perhaps due to not letting it sit for 24 hrs per the instructions.  The seal for the window vent is not very good - I needed to put some painter’s tap around the edges to keep bugs/flys out.  Draining the unit also was not too good - had to significantly tilt the unit to get water out of the drainage port, but that caused some water leakage higher up the unit near the handles so not sure what’s going on there.  All that said, this unit is powerful and blows nice cold air enough to keep a larger size room comfortable.  I have a town house with high ceilings - 16 ft with exposure to the hall access to the upper bedrooms and I can feel A/C in that hall.  I only need A/C for maybe 2 weeks out of the year sporadically in the summer so for me this unit is a good cost trade over central air at a 1/10 of the cost.

  I did a lot of research and found this amazing air conditioner.  Honestly it's more quiet then most I have heard it easy to assemble.. I am a female in my 30's and did it myself.. the portion that goes in The window which mine is about 58"" in height at my apartment.. fits perfect!! I read a lot of reviews about people having to cut but that was not the case. I waited the 24 hours as suggested in the manual to turn it on after delivery to let everything settle I guess and ran it all day today. It is More quiet than expected and my apartment is definitely cool. It doesn't really reach the bedroom but it is the design of the apartment.. I never write reviews but this one gets 5 stars from me. More than pleased so far. Oh And it came earlier than expected which was nice because it is really hot right now.

So far, SO good
","

  TL;DR: Don’t hesitate. If you have a small/medium sized room that needs AC, this is by far the best option. Do yourself a favor!This has truly been a life saver. I moved to San Francisco and haven’t had any AC for about 6 months. The warmer days it got about 75-80 in our apartment, coming from the south it was bearable (with some fans).As we began the heat wave in CA, our apartment was sitting at 85-95 degrees and was horrible. No amount of fans fixed it, and our windows are bay style, so a traditional window AC was not an option.I decided to take the plunge and get this AC and am SO HAPPY I did. It has cooled down our bedroom to the point where we can actually get a good nights sleep for the first time in a what feels like forever. I seriously cannot recommend it enough.A few more notes:- I did not use the included windows panel, so I can’t speak to how good that is- We have a relatively small room, about 150sqft, and it works beautifully, but I can’t speak to how good it would be in a larger room- I let the unit sit for 24 hrs before use, so if you don’t do that, I’m not sure how good your experience will be. The coolant needs time to settle after shipment.

  *** TIP FOR THE A/C OUTPUT NOT BEING COLD!!! ***Make sure the mode is on the cool setting and check the black knob (check picture) on the bottom part of the unit and wiggle it until the generator kicks in (you will hear it kick on when you adjust it.) When I first got the unit and turned it on I didn't hear anything but fan noise even with the setting on cool. It takes about 3 minutes to kick out cold air! I used a temperature gun and its about 50-60 degrees with the temp outside being in the 90s. The noise is not bad at all its about as loud as a regular large fan on high settings. I use to have a LG A/C and that thing sounded like a airplane jet on. I hope this helps!

  I'm always a bit skeptical about buying stuff without trying it first. I read the reviews. I usually start with the 1s to see what they complain about. I only buy 4 stars or better. The price was good. Could have gone for the one $100.00+ more, but I decided on the Black and Decker. The Black and Decker unit works great. Bought it for our dining room. Set it up, turned it on and it blows lots of cold air. I bought a unit a little bigger than I needed just to make sure it does the job well. I'm very happy. The window adapter is cheesy, weak, ugly, but that was to be expected. I'm going to make my own insert for the sliding door to close against. The fan noise is noticeable. not to loud, but the air is cold, so I'm not going to complain. Going to buy another for my son's room. Price was good. I recommend this unit.

  I bought this to cool my mobile home during the summer. I expected it to be very noisy but it's no louder than our dehumidifier which is not too bad. If we are watching TV, two notches up on the volume is plenty. I live in a very humid climate so I have never used it as a dehumidifier,  I already have one. For cooling it does a great job. We have approximately 400 square feet we needed to keep cool and it did a wonderful job. So well in fact that I didn't need fans on in the other rooms far away from the air conditioner because the cool air circulates enough. It did make the room more humid because of the self evaporation but if you run a separate dehumidifier at night it is really no big deal. It cooled a much larger area than advertised as long as you don't need it below 72 in your home. Power wise I ran it about 20-30 hours a week depending on temperature and it cost about 30 dollars for the month. I would consider that pretty decent.  The window panel fits perfectly into windows that open to the side like mine do. A small piece of advice, put a little bit of duct tape on the part where the hose attaches so it doesn't pop off every time you move it. You will have to replace the tape every once in a while but it will save your sanity on hot days

Lifesaver for those living in warmer areas

  *** I'm pretty sure the warmth review for this product means the coldness of it so I gave it a 5***So onto the review, I bought this because the people in my house are older and don't like the a/c being on a comfortable temperature during the summer, which usually means my small room which is filled with electronics that produce heat is usually a hotbox as I like to keep the door closed. I went from using one fan to using 2 fans and after finally giving in, decided to buy a personal a/c for me and now I'm down to no fans.I live in Florida where it's hot all year round and the summer months are especially brutal. This product has made it so much more bearable as my room is always nice and cool when I enter it. I'd say my room is a good 160-180 sqft and it cools the whole thing just fine (I went ahead and got the 10k model instead of the 8k because it was only a few dollars more at the time).I've only had it for a few weeks now but I can say I actually feel comfortable in my room again. I love the cold so I usually keep it on a 69 when I'm in and sleeping and then when I'm working I turn on the sleep function at a 75 so it cycles on and off to atleast keep it cool when I'm not in it.As for the noise, as others have said, it's not bad at all. I have 2 bends in my window tube and it's barely noticeable once you get used to it. As others have described, it's like a hotel a/c. And maybe the same amount of sound as a fan on max settings.Installation was much easier than I thought it'd be because I thought the window kit would be much more complicated but it turns out it wasn't. I have a regular window so it slides to adjust perfectly. I was able to seal it up pretty well nothing gets in or out.I have not gotten my first electricity bill but will update when I do to see how much it has changed it. Honestly don't even care if it goes up too much as I'd rather have comfort than be miserable with a cheaper bill.

  It cools a room effectively and QUICKLY (within 90 seconds), but it produces white noise. The noise may be desirable or undesirable as the case may be. If you have a noisy street, the AC unit produces a white noise that blocks that out. In any case, this cools the room quite well and quite fast. Setup was easy as pie: it took two people 10-15 minutes tops, and we were NOT at the top of our game intellectually due to the terrible heat.Well worth $400.I'd recommend it.

Works 'OK' but bottom line is: Window AC > Portable AC
","

  First off, I live in Pacoima CA and it gets quite toasty, 108° currently today... This portable AC worked OK up until about a week ago when it's been consistently 100+... Every. Single. Day. 🥵This portable AC unit just couldn't handle it anymore, and my small room (12' x 14') wasn't getting below 89° for the better part of the day. This was with it maxed out at it's lowest 64° setting.I've since purchased a much cheaper, cheap-as-can-be $139 window AC unit and couldn't be happier. My room is finally cool, bearable, and the temp hasn't gotten past 80° all day! 👌Also, the window unit is only 5,000 btu, compared to this 8,000 btu portable unit. - - - Window AC > Portable AC - - -Here is the Window AC unit I purchased:Arctic King 5,000 BTU 115V Mechanical Window Air Conditioner, WWK05CM01N

  The unit was working well until is suddenly malfunctioned, making a crackling noise, and no longer cooling the room.  I was always diligent about maintenance (cleaning the filter).

  After reading some review that people complaining about the noise level. Don't believe them, this is a great buy. The noise level is typical and normal for a portable AC. It cools the room pretty fast. I set it up for 72 degrees, and according to my indoor thermometer it cools down to 71 degrees. Although my electricity went up, by 75 dollars the first month, average use of 10 hours a day. We are very please buy this AC. It's a lifesaver during heat wave.

Amazing Product, Bad Packaging

  I don't usually write reviews, but I thought this product deserved one. Upon receiving the package, there was a huge hole in the box covered with tape. I thought it was going to be a disaster when I opened the box, but everything was in one piece, kinda, there's crack on the front panel but nothing else that would render the product useless. I decided to test it out first before trying to return it, and I've got to say this thing is amazing! I have a relatively small room (~90 sq ft) and this unit keeps my room very cool. Yes the unit is a little loud, but honestly sounds like white noise that you eventually forget is there. As far as leakage and draining, I haven't had to do any of that, I check every week just in case but still no water build up. (I live in CA where it's not too humid but maybe that'll help give you some sort of reference). Overall, the product does exactly as advertised, I just wish they wouldn't have damaged the unit on its way here.

  Love this portable AC! It works perfectly in my condo. I goes the 12,000 BTU only so I can use it when I move to a bigger place. Only thing is the exhaust hose that it comes with there’s only 4.5 feet. So unless you have the AC unit sitting right in front of the window you’ll have to get a longer one. I purchases a longer one off amazon. It you do by another hose make sure it’s 5 inches and is counter clockwise thread. Other than the hose being short I love this ac.

  My prior AC unit was 15 amps, which in my older apartment is a few too many amps to run well. I wanted to find a unit that would keep me cool and yet not pull so many amps. I read this page carefully to find the amps, and the page clearly states 9amps. So i ordered and waited 10 days (after many shipping snafus) and the unit arrived. Upon unpacking and setting up, i sat down to read the instructions and found.. the unit draws 15 amps.So this page is wrong, and do not believe it if you need exact amperage.

Works Better as a Portable Heater!
","

  Live and learn... Ugh!I was tired of dealing with heavy, noisy window units and I thought this portable unit might be a better alternative. WRONG!I installed this unit in my home office during quarantine. Worked fine at first, when early summer temperatures were below 90...but it soon proved to be worthless, despite my constant, meticulous cleaning of the filter and draining of the water reservoir, thinking those things would help it cool efficiently.It’s impossible that this is 12,000 BTUs.  I have it in a small room running with a fan to help push around the “cooled” air, and it doesn’t even cool the adjoining hallway.I purchased an inexpensive, 6000 BTU GE window unit for my much larger bedroom, and it cools flawlessly AND is SO much quieter!I have to turn this unit off during business calls and Zoom meetings in order to hear and be heard properly... not good.Part of the problem with the portable may be the ridiculously flawed hose attachment. It’s nearly impossible to secure the hose to the unit well enough that it doesn’t pop off with a slight bunk or movement of the unit.As others have said, I once neglected to notice that the hose had detached from the back of the unit, and in no time at all, the room had heated so much, it was intolerable!In the future, I’ll have to go back to a window unit and maybe retire this as a fan and dehumidifier... or possibly a heater for the winter months, if I keep the hose detached!

  This is a heaven-sent! It’s amazing! This was an impulse buy because I just couldn’t deal with the dry, humid heat anymore, but I’m so glad I ordered this! Also, due to all the fires, it was hard to sleep with the window closed since it was so smoky outside. This allows my room to feel fresh without letting the smoke in. I’ve never owned a portable AC before so I’m not sure what they “normally” sound like, to me it’s a bit loud but I was still able to take a nap through it! The cold air blows so strong even on the low setting, so I definitely think this is worth the price. I wish the hose was a bit longer though. Overall, I’m absolutely happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it!

Nice and Cool
","

  After many years of having one poor window unit trying to cool my whole house, I finally decided to get an air conditioner for the bedroom.  I didn't want a regular window unit, because I still want the option of opening the window.  This really blows cool air.  If I close the door, it cools off the room quickly.  It was fairly easy to assemble, although the window connection kit is kind of awkward.  I have no idea why the hole in the window plate is not round.  The hose is round, but you have to attach it to an oval adapter to connect it to the window plate.  Also, the adapter pops out easily when I take the plate out of the window and when I put it back in.  A minor inconvenience, especially if you plan to leave it in all the time.  I just don't see why it was made that way.  Other portable units I have had fit much tighter, to the point where it is difficult to separate the hose from the window plate when you want to.  The only other minor issue for me was the lights for the temperature and settings.  They are very bright in a dark room.  No big deal, I just put some duct tape over them so they wouldn't keep me awake.  The noise level doesn't bother me, I'd say it is comparable to a regular window unit.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this.  It is convenient, it cools very well, and is a big relief on hot, humid nights.

  I've had the 12,000 BTU unit for a month now and it is way better than I expected. It's not as noisy as some of the other reviews have stated.

The only thing I can find to complain about is the remote not having a backlight.The display on the unit itself is bright when the room is dark, which was annoying at first, but now I don't mind considering I'm night blind without my glasses; makes getting up in the middle of the night easier so I don't trip over anything or step on one of my cats.Definitely worth the money!

Nice AC Unit and No Complaints
","

  Normally the San Francisco East Bay does not get super hot summers being in the upper 70s and lower 80s, so most homes do not have AC. A recent extended heat wave put day temps to the high 90s and over 100, with high 80s over night, so I decided to get this unit for the master bedroom. It arrived two days after ordering and reading cautionary review here, I let it sit for 24 hours - which is also now recommended on the both the box and supplementary instruction sheet inside the shipping box - to let the refrigerant resettle. Installation was easy, although as the manual for the unit advises some improvising was in order. Instead of using the foam strips that came with the unit, I bought a couple rolls of self-adhesive Sponge Window Seal tape from HomeDepot; 3/4"" and 1-1/4"" wide rolls. My widow is a slider and has a vertical opening 56"" which is more than the self-adhesive foam supplied with the unit. The sponge seal tape was also much thicker (3/8"") than the unit foam. I followed the instructions using my seal tapes and made nice seals. The three piece Winder Slider was at max extension, so in addition the the screws I used some white duct tape to reenforce the it. I also ran the white duct tape over the form so that it closed the seams and hide the black sponge form seal strips. I they bought some white thin foam poster from the local craft store to cover over the window opening opposite the ac exhaust port/slider and block outside light. Lastly I did use the non-adhesive foam strip to seal the vertical gap between the window frame and outer window - just sort of pushed it into the gap. Like any ac unit it is going to make noise and you will know its on. I took some sound level readings. At 2 feet; with the unit off the ambient room level was 33 dB and with it running set to 72 degrees it was 58 dB.Until I read the user guide I really didn't know that this was a semi-permanent installation in the window, which it is. It can be moved at the end of the summer heat season, but you'll have to go though the whole foam seal and tape routine to reinstall it. if you want to leave the window slider kit and seals in place you'll have to deal with the hose attachment hole as it doesn't come with a cap or plug for the opening of the window slider kit. If I decide to disconnect the unit and put in storage closet, I will probably make a cover/cap out of the foam board and tape over the hole - but it would be nice it it just came with a cap for the hole. That little addition would have made it a five star in my book.

I kinda hate this thing
","

  My condo is upstairs & has no air conditioning. After suffering a few summers I bought this out of desperation. It cools one room down somewhat but I have to run it for hours in order to get it cool. It’s also incredibly LOUD so I can’t really watch TV or anything while it’s running. However, what I hate most about it is the vent you have to hook up to the back. The stupid thing keeps popping off & then it blows hot air from the unit all over the room. The vent tube is hard to attach & has no mechanism for latching or securing it to the unit, so it pops off repeatedly. Very frustrating & annoying. Like I said, I kinda hate this thing.

  As I write this, I am in my cool and air conditioned bedroom. :-)  This is a very good portable AC unit. I had a different unit from LG previously. The LG unit was slightly larger (14K BTU), and it was significantly more expensive than this model. This model is good for the price...AND if you are using it for the right application. My bedroom is only about 14x14. Great for a small to medium space. Noise level is “fine.”  It’s like white noise. The normal for a portable unit.Installation was easy. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars was the single small plastic “screw” that was to be used to secure the sliding window baffles. It simply did not work to secure the sliding parts. I had to use regular metal screws from my tool box. Not a huge deal, but poorly designed for that and would be an easy fix.Currently chilling at 70 degrees. Enjoy!

  Like other reviewers have mentioned, the BTU reading is incredibly misleading. Do not compare this to other units without checking to verify they are describing the same cooling capacity. With that said I think this is a fine AC unit. It cools my small 10x15 room quickly and efficiently. I don’t think the noise is as bad as other people say - it sounds like a loud fan.The dehumidifier function was an important reason for purchasing this unit but I’m having trouble discerning how effective it is without elevating the unit and using the drain hose attachment. Other units also display room humidity so you can easily see the % humidity while the unit runs, but this device does not have that functionality. If it turns out that this feature (the dehumidifier) is not effective then I will return and update this review.

  Perhaps a bit loud, but you have to expect that it will make noise as it is an air conditioner and is to be used in a smaller room.

  I run this in my bedroom (in Illinois) just to keep my bedroom cool in the summer. Never mind that I also have central air and my house is generally cool. After just over 1 year of owning, the fan is already going out and won't work properly. Of course, when I call Black & Decker, I get transferred to an overseas call center to a person I cannot understand. I gave them all proper information and was told I would be called in a few days about returning and replacing. One week passed and I never heard anything. I called them and they told me that they would call in a day or two. Another week passed, and nothing. I am not someone to post negative reviews about things and I usually roll my eyes at reviews like this since I feel like people are just being drama queens and crying about stuff but I am thoroughly disappointed about this purchase and will NEVER buy another Black & Decker again.

  The connection inside the unit that connects the exhaust tube is just a small piece of plastic which we unfortunately learned is easily breakable.  I have a different AC unit by another maker and the connection is strong and the design is good.  To me, this is a design flaw in that I have limited options to reattach.  So far duct tape just eventually detaches from the heat that is being expelled.  I think the cooling is decent, no complaints. No complaints on the noise.

  Wasn't happy about the condition of the parts when it arrived. In one of the pictures I have uploaded it shows one of the window adaptors for mounting the air hose to the window. It came dented and cracked. The packaging of the item was unremarkable so I can only assume that this happened at the factory. a few marks on other parts but luckily the unit itself works without issue and I can hide the blemishes that were on it.Be careful with the thin weather guard. If it sticks to you at all it will rip very easily and is almost impossible to get it easily off of your fingers or other items. Make sure you only get it on things that it is supposed to go on. I attached a picture of it stuck to my finger, took a long time to get it off my hands. Great for stickiness but horrible if there is an issue.Unit seems to be working alright but due to the condition that it arrived in I can't give it a higher rating because if that happened to the other window adaptor I would have had to return the entire thing which already got delayed in being shipped to my house.

  I bought this because the 20 year old in wall air conditioner in my bedroom has started acting up periodically and I don’t want anyone in my apartment right now. Also, the one in the living room is just as old, so if they both end up no longer usable this is a great portable solution. As others may have written, don’t expect this to be quiet or as chilling as your window or in wall unit. But it’s enough to cool down a room to a comfortable temperature to fall asleep, and when it reaches the set temperature the fan is fairly quiet. The majority of the noise comes from the rush of air, and as far as I can tell there is no discernible difference between fan speeds. The remote works well. I’ve used it for about a whopping 8 hours so far just to test it one very hot night. I’ll continue using my wall unit for now but I’m no longer panicking about having no air conditioner during the dog days of summer. I should add that I did have to ask for help in trimming down one of the very substantial plastic window inserts a little to fit my window. A power saw was needed for that and I’m fortunate my family could help me out. This is a pricey item considering other options work better, but it’s the only option for me right now because I could install it myself.

The Best There Is
","

  After buying one of these 12,000 BTU units, I was so impressed with its performance I tried to buy another one, but only 10,000 BTU, but I was unable to find one anywhere that could be shipped out before September (this was in June 2020). So I ended up finding a 10,000 BTU TOSHIBA Portable at Home Depot figuring Toshiba had to be at least as good as Black and Decker, if not better. Wrong, the Black and Decker blows it away in performance and it's not just the extra 2,000 BTU's because I have the Toshiba in a room 1/3 of the size, only a 10' x 10' room so 10,000 BTU's should be vast overkill, but it's not, at all. I gave the Black and Decker only 4 stars for noise level because it IS pretty noisy, but ALL portable units are and this one is no more and no less. Likewise I gave it only 4 stars for energy efficiency because I don't know yet, I haven't gotten the electric bill yet. The 4 stars for warmth are because if you run the exhaust hose out too far it will throw quite a bit of heat, which is a testament to it's efficiency: an A/C unit is essentially a heat pump; it doesn't put cold air in, it takes hot air out...as exhaust. It doesn't matter to me because I just pushed the unit up against the wall where I wanted to use it, marked the outlet there, and cut a 6"" hole right through the wall ducting it to the outside directly using only 6"" of fully collapsed exhaust hose so there is no detectable heat transfer at all. This is a GREAT portable A/C and I fully recommend it wholeheartedly!

Perfect when windows are small

  The portable air conditioner is just what we needed. We have four windows in our bedroom but they are all small and a window air conditioner will not fit. The Black and Decker unit fits the bill. It is not too heavy and it works exactly as suggested by manufacturer. Only drawback is that the attachment to the window is not as adaptable as it should be. All of these portable types should have the adaptability to attach to a small window, the one reason why many people buy them. We were lucky that the one we bought just fit, but others will not be. That's why i gave it four stars.

  Because this unit is in a room and not in the window, it does take up space in your room. However, it is small enough to not be annoying. It is quiet and efficient and cools the room well enough for us. I like this over window units because it is portable so we can easily move it if need be. Of course, if you want the vent attached to a window and not just blowing hot air into another room, it takes away from the portability. Would buy again and may be purchasing a second unit for another room in the future.

  Bought this black and decker AC unit about 2 years ago. Here in Seattle we dont need much AC, just about 2-3 weeks a year of use. Well we rolled it out and set it up for the next two weeks, and it died after 2 days of use. So... I only got maybe 5 weeks of working use out of this product before it died. That’s a pretty expensive way to cool off for a few weeks... :/ Warranty lasts 1 year on parts and service and 5 years on the compressor- it does indeed sound like the compressor died because the fan still kicks on, and we heard the compressor whine and die and now it only blows hot air. But guess what- good luck proving it to the outsourced support company based outside the US.

  I have this unit in the master bedroom.  It does cool the room nicely and does the job I wanted it too.  Despite the claim that it has three fan speeds, there is no change when flipping between them.  I recorded a constant 60db next to the unit on each speed.  The only time the speed changes is when it meets the desired temperature.  Then the noise level dropped to 55db.  I would give the unit 5 stars for cooling performance, 1 star for stated features that do not work as you would expect.

  I was worried about the bad reviews saying that it doesn't work properly. And to be honest it does feel a bit cheap. But after a couple nights I can say it works great! I set it to 72 last night, and when I woke up this morning the thermostat read 72.. so it definitely works! I will update this review if things change down the road, but for now I'm loving it!I say it feels cheap because the window kit doesn't completely fit right, but we made it work. The touch controls on the top don't register easily, you gotta really press down to make them work. The vent flaps don't move easily, it took a fuss to move them pointing upwards.Noise level is okay, about the same level as the window unit I was replacing. I used a sound meter app and got around 40db when standing near it. 40db is pretty quiet, but still definately audible.The remote works great. Like I said before the touch controls on the unit aren't that great, but the remote is awesome! No complaints there. Overall I'm satisfied, just hoping it continues to work well.

  The air conditioner itself is not too bad. It's kept our large living room/open kitchen area cool enough to be tolerable enough. Unfortunately, the hose on the back has thin plastic that holds it on and one of those pieces snapped when disassembling it for the winter. Now that summer is back, I had to use tape to hold that side of the hose onto the AC unit. It is constantly leaking air and I'm having to re-adjust the tape. It's letting heat escape back into the house. This wouldn't be as big of a problem if they at least sold the part that broke. It should just be a cheap $5 fix for the piece of plastic... but apparently you have to re-buy the entire AC unit just to get that piece.

  The tube constantly falls off leading it pushing even hotter air into the room. The tube also broke the first time I used it. Not only that but it's positioned at the bottom of the device and sticks right out the back so good luck fitting it up against a wall. Also the uninsulated tube puts a lot of extra heat right back into the room, so not very efficient. It's also the loudest possible compressor when it kicks on so don't even try to sleep in the same room with this thing. Don't waste your money.

  This seemed to be the best unit for the price available. Much more quiet than a window mount unit but still not silent as no AC unit is. I can run it in dry Southern California all day and night and it continues to put out cold air. If the cold air starts to diminish you can help by insulating and shortening the duct run out the window or making sure it is drained (never and issue for me with dry climate)The things I don't like are the remote functions. There is no back-light on the remote LCD so a challenge to see at night and the buttons are complicated to set on/off timers not responding properly. This is a RF remote not an IR remote so it sends more complicated info. I would prefer it to be simple and work every time. The only buttons on the unit itself are on/off, temperature, mode, and fan speed. So you need the remote for all other functions.The other thing that is annoying is the lights on the unit are super bright and will light up your room at night. A simple dimming sheet fixes this.Lastly, when the unit does get the room down to temperature it will cycle on and off every few minutes. Unfortunately no one makes a variable speed AC unit with better modulating settings so I can't hold it against this unit.Note: The first unit I received was definitely used and was missing parts, seems to happen a lot on Amazon these days, but a new unit was promptly shipped and the old one picked up by UPS for no extra charge.

So far so good,not a heater,the vent hose heats up if used for longer .'s of time. Possibly normal-
","

  I have to wait at least 24 hours to set this up since it was delivered upside down even though the package clearly states to keep in upright. This is a little investment that we can't really afford in these desparate times. I appreciate it was delivered to my door, that rarely happens, so thank you for that. Hopefully this unit lasts more than one summer. I cannot afford another one so. I will be back with a full review once I am able to set it up.Update*it was somewhat difficult to get up the stairs- and when we move, I am sure it will be even more difficult getting it down two flights of stairs. Maybe that quality, it works super well for the one room, it's nice to be able to work and sleep without suffering the heat. I am happy for this, although I haven't received an electric bill yet. For me and my household this works, I might have to invest in another one for upstairs-maybe next year?  Yeah right.

A touch cooler...

  It's got its own battery which is great.  It's powerful enough as a personal fan, and comes in a cute little cube shape.  With ice water, i measure 4-5F cooler than the surrounding air temperature.  Nothing amazing but it will feel a touch cooler.  It has a light function which is useless but it's there.  The ""modes"" function is annoying and pointless.  It also leaks if you tip it to one side or another, which is also annoying.Overall it's just ""okay"" and i'm sure there are better evaporative coolers out there.

Doesn’t blow cold air and blows very little air
","

  The entire product is fundamentally flawed. The compartment for ice is so small and barely holds any ice or water. As a result, it doesn’t blow cold air. It barely blows any air at all. Its just a light breeze. If you slightly move the fan a lot of the water falls out making it a hazard next to electronics. The product is also very small and very noisy for the minimal air it blows.However, there are three things that are good about the product. It has a night light if you hold the second button and you can tilt where the slight air blows similar to a car. It also has a 2000 mAh built in battery.However, despite these nice things this fan offers, it doesn’t change the fact that the product’s main purpose doesn’t work. At the end it’s just a fan that leaks water and barely blows any air. Even if it was cheaper than the current price, I can’t recommend this product. At about $40, it’s just not worth it.

  It is seriously tiny.  Check the dimensions before buying, don't just go by the photos like I did. Here is a photo with a woman's hand for you.  It works well for tour such a tiny thing, I guess, I don't have anything to compare it to.  It's kind of hard to get the water in, you have to use a special plastic dropper for it, the dropper comes in the package.  Basically, if you lose the dropper you won't be able to get the water in.  Getting ice in seems impossible. It uses up the water fast, so it works as hard as it can.  The battery lasts a while, much longer than water.  It uses a similar charger to your phone, which is, again, indicative of it's size and power capacity.I don't think it makes any sense to buy it for use at home because of its size. It might make sense to take it with you on the go, since it's so compact and holds the charge well. You might even be able to use it while walking.

  Ok, I am not sure if the reviews that gave it 5 stars where gifted there's for a review but I'm honestly scratching my head as to why anyone would give this 5 stars??  First off it is small.  And that's ok as they say it's small. But just be prepared for SMALL.  I filled it with water and it immediately dribbled out the bottom.  When you put the water in btw if you tip it ever so slightly in any direction the water falls out as there is no chamber container that holds the water in. (See pictures) and where it says to put ice in is a joke.  you have to chop your ice into little pieces the size of your finger nails to fit it in.  (Again see the size of ice container in pictures, plus that ice cube is small.  It is smaller than the regular size ice cube tray) So the water falls out everywhere and it can't hold regular size ice cubes so really all you are left with is a tiny fan that unless you are less than a foot away from it you can even feel the air....  So, this is a big run for your life warning and dont make the same mistake as me and waste your money.

  Opening the box and it smells strongly of plastic. Originally I hated it, thought it would blow plasticy smelling air on me and that would definitely be a low rating.That smell went away after a day or two.The box comes with a handy little refiller bottle that is good for filling up the water reservoir without making a mess. You can also slide the box apart to load it with ice for an extra cool breeze.I first heard about these fans/air conditioners reading an article about the science behind them. They're small scale but much more efficient than conventional air conditioners. My first thought was ""no way, if air conditioning could be made THAT much more efficient it would have been done by now"" but the more I read into it the more I was swayed. That was last winter so of course I didn't look into getting one.Was reminded this summer with a facebook ad but the one they were selling was expensive (~$80). I distinctly remembered reading how cheap they were to produce so I looked on Amazon. Found one I liked (small/sleek/black, fits in well on my desk next to my computer).Only complaints: It's a bit nosier than I would like on higher settings. But it's fine because the low setting is enough to keep me cool. Also, the included micro-usb cable is white while the rest is black. Makes a sharp contrast (doesn't fit the colors of the rest of the desk). Debating buying a new cable just to lose the white one.Otherwise, it sits on my desk and keeps me cool in the summer without needing to keep my whole-house A/C on too high while I watch shows and work on my home business. Definitely cutting back on my energy bill. So it's a win-win.

  I love this fan. I was looking for something to take along with me for camping. This is a perfect solution. I love how you can make it cooler by adding ice or water.

Good quality portable air conditioner
","

  Best thing about this evaporation air conditioner is that it is HIGHLY portable. Just charge it up and you can take it with you anywhere. It is akin to a high quality camping fan. The batteries last a long time, the highest setting with ionization it lasts for about two and a half hours. On the lowest setting (which is still very powerful) it lasts for about  8 hours. Plenty of operating time. It charges completely in about 3 hours. The fan can be used with just water, or to make it even colder you can add ice cubes! The only thing is that it needs a stable base because it can spill the water if tilted after adding. I plan to use this when camping, or fishing. Perfect for the outdoors because it is so portable! It even has a carrying handle at the top. It comes with everything you need, charging cable, perfect sized water bottle with measurements so that you don't overfill. I would recommend this to people who need cold air especially when they are not close to an electric outlet!

💝💘❄️❄️❄️ Negative Ion Generator Really Cools the Air ❄️❄️❄️💓💓
","

   As I'm writing this review on this Mikikin Portable Air conditioner Fan, the mercury outside my apartment is in the 90+. If I had left my vegetables outside on kitchen countertops, they turned yellow or brown quickly because the indoor temperatures are so high lately. I do have an AC in the apartment, but I'm reluctant to use unless it's necessary, when pets or elderly are at home. Once I turn that baby up, there's no way I'm turning it down, and my electric bills skyrockets.Most of the time, I live alone, so in order to cut down on electricity bills and still stay cool, that's when this Mikikin Portable Air Conditioner Fan address two of my concerns amazingly, and here's why:PROS==== * Effective: this tiny box actually provides really cool air to your own personal space, I slept well last night without having to keep energy hogging AC on all night * 💘💝❄️❄️The Technology ❄️❄️:💓💕 while being so tiny yet able to provide cool air is this unit contains a ""Negative Ion Generator"" which generates negative ions to break up the water molecules, allowing to dry your hair faster in Negative Ion Hair Dryer. Similarly, the negative ions break up the water molecules (in the reservoir) & help it cool down much faster 💕💓❄️❄️❄️❄️💝💓  * Two Modes 「Water」&「Ice Cubes」: you can fill the water reservoir with either water, I only use this & it cools down amazingly fast; if you got ice cubes at home, you can fill the reservoir with ice cubes, the negative ions do even a better job, water in ANY state, liquid (water) or Solid (ice) is H2O, so the negative ions work exactly the same way, only with ice, you get obviously much cooler air!!!!  * Features & Functionalities:  - 3 fan speeds (press POWER to toggle through different fan power settings)  - serves as LED night light by long press the MODE button to turn ON/OFF  - Rechargeable via micro-USB cable so you can take this baby anywhere & not tied to a cord & having to be plugged into a wall outlet  - at merely 22OZ, that's portable anywhere - office, car, beaches🆗🆙👍NOTE👍🆗🆙Some reviews negatively reflected this fam, and didn't do justice, again, with reasonable expectation, it's < $30, C'mon NOW😙😏😏  Noise Level: some complained too loud, I had it at highest level #3, and I leave it right next to my pillow as I sleep, I sleep right through every night - so loud noise isn't justified  Not Cool Enough: again, as ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"", noise Level & cold are, too! I find it reasonably cold enough so that it won't run up my electricity bill, you can't have it both ways!The VERDICT==========  If you don't have or want to keep your electricity bills down especially during the summer, and still want to stay cool, then there's nothing better than this Mikikin portable air conditioner fan. It uses naked iron technology to break down the water molecules so the air with cool faster, you have two options to fill the reservoir with ice or water either way it works equally well! Of course iceccubes allowed the temperature to be lowe to begin with, so you can extra cool air out of the fan. It weighs a little more than a pound so it's extremely lightweight and it's so small  you can take this baby anywhere because it's rechargeable!. But most of all, not only it keeps you cool but he saves you electricity bills!!!!👍👍😂😂😂💓💘💝 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED💕💕💕💕  -

  I'm going on a rant, but here is my experience:First off this thing is loud...even on the lowest setting.Second, it does not mist.Third, the water/ ice tray is so tiny I could barely fit more than a few ice cubes in it and I could not feel any cooler air.Fourth, the front movable fins can jiggle and make an annoying sound.Fifth, the battery life is questionable; in the manual it states the first use will last multiple hours, second use will last even less and so on.If you want a laugh, look at the product description section for misspellings and incorrect grammar.Stay away or you will be disappointed.

Portable cooling solution this summer
","

  It’s summer, and I got this portable AC to help make things a little more comfortable.  I bought this for my teenage son’s desk so that we don’t have to use the house AC often.  It did helped a lot to make the air more cool.The package was smaller than I expected.  The box is thin with minimal branding.  Inside the box is the portable AC, a plastic squeeze bottle, and a mini USB cable.  I like the matte finish as it is not a fingerprint magnet.  The build quality is ok, sturdy enough to withstand a few bumps. It’s very small and cute, I was skeptical at first if it has enough power to really cool a small space.  It has no power adapter, but you can connect this to any USB port to power it up and charge the batteries.  The batteries are good to have for total portability, but we’re using this mostly plugged on top of a desk.  There are only 2 buttons for operations, it was a little confusing at first, but after reading the user manual, it is simple to operate.  I was surprised how powerful this small fan is, it blows a lot of air for its size.  The product has a small access door on the side to fill in the water compartment, but you can also slide out the entire back cover to separate the water compartment for refills.  I prefer to do the later for easier and faster refills.  It does blow a cool breeze when filled with water.  On a hot day, it is very helpful to cool a small space like a workstation or desk space.  My son also uses this while he sleeps beside his nightstand.  Not the coolest, but you can definitely feel a big difference in comfort.Overall, it’s a great little product.  Don’t expect this to cool an entire room, it’s meant to be used for small personal spaces.  It doesn’t blow cold air, but a cool breeze enough to make you comfortable during hot days.  Highly recommended.NOTE:  If you find this review helpful, please vote it as helpful from the button below.  Thanks.

Great cooling, draining could be more convenient
","

  The Midea Smart 3-in-1 Portable Air Conditioner does an awesome job cooling. I ran this in a room that is approximately 13 x 16 with 12-foot ceilings (208 square feet or 2496 cubic feet). The higher ceilings mean this room has a lot more air to cool that you’d think by the 208 square foot floor area, but the Midea AC dropped it 4 degrees in 30 minutes on a very hot day.This A/C has some really thoughtful design touches, it’s easy to roll, a dream to set up, the plastic accessories are VERY heavy duty, and it works really, really well. Did I mention it was easy to set up and cooled an incredible amount? At 42 degrees, the air coming out of this baby is 2-4 degrees colder than my 5-ton Goodman A/C unit is putting out.What’s not to love? Well, the instruction booklet could use a re-write. Some parts of it – especially those regarding draining – are very confusing and pictures are misleading. So it took some extra work to puzzle things out. It also talks about the heater and heat pump, even though there is no heater in this unit. Confusing. The instruction book and the drainage system both need work.Note: You cannot run a drain tube up and out the window as is shown in the pictures from this A/C; it just won’t work. By the way, this A/C has two drain tubes: one at the bottom of the back and one mid-center of the back. Frankly, this A/C unit needs a good removable drain tray as part of its design. You definitely want a tray or low tub for this to drain into. We live in a semi-arid region and this still pulled water out of the air.  In addition, to drain this when you’re getting ready to put it away, you really need to lay it flat on its back, which you need to do very gently, so you don’t break said drain off. I laid it – very gently – on a layer of towels to do this. Plus, you’re supposed to run this fan-only for 12 hours to completely dry it out before storing to prevent mildew and mold. I’m running it 24 hours, even at our low humidity, because I do NOT want this to mold.The unit can use the remote for sensing temperature and using that to base its operation off of, rather than taking the temp at the unit itself. Very nice touch! I did not use the smart app because we’re using this as a temporary A/C. If we were using it permanently in one room, we would use the app. But with the remote and using it temporarily in one room, the app didn’t add enough that we felt it was useful.Overall, I’m incredibly pleased with how well this unit works, although I really wish the drainage system was designed with a built-in removable tray. Two drains to work with totally outside the unit is a bit inconvenient. However, even with that inconvenience, I really like this thing.As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart. Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

No drain hose, nothing.  And it was HUMID out. After three weeks I thought I should drain it.  Opened up the bottom plug and got a couple drops out of it. That's it!

  So I saw some rating this very high. I saw YouTube glowing reviews! I got everything together put the vent in window turned on and wow really cold air right away, but the the P1 light came on meaning it needed to be drained this happend with in 30-40 of use and kept happening.  I've also seen other's with the same issue as mine as well I took a chance to you need to be able to keep this draining and let me tell you it collects a lot of water on AC going So because of this big issue I give it a two star. I""m not sure if maybe I got a bad unit or something happened in shipping or if it was built bad from the start. I would not recommend it you shouldn't have to figure out how to keep this from filling up and putting a bucket down so it can keep draining.  You want a AC that if in your bedroom you can keep on most of the night.

  Really impressed with this unit!!! I didn't expect it to keep me so cool and look so good!!!  My HVAC went out and in over 90 degree heat I couldn't stand the thought of waiting the week or two to get the new motor ordered, received and installed so I got this as a back-up!!! It cools down the entire room and en-suite bathroom of my condo!!  Amazingly cool and comfortable!!!  I just wish it had an extension long enough to fit in a sliding glass door (here in Florida we have many sliding glass doors and need an 80"" high slot to put in the air hose/vent)!!  Actually I can't wait for the day they make one of these that you don't have to vent out a window or door!!  In the meantime, this is an Exception portable air conditioner!!  It is too heavy for me to carry up and down the stairs of my condo (I had planned on using it at night in my bedroom and during the day in my downstairs living room), but it still is HEAVEN to have a Cool, comfortable Bedroom and Bath during this awful HOT Summer!!!  Thank you!!!

  This is my first portable A/C unit, and I was surprised to see this was actually a 3-in-1 system. A/C, fan and dehumidifier! It's also a smart unit, and works well with smart assistants which I was glad to see, since I'm trying to have as many things as possible smart these days. It's easy to roll it around the house from room to room and light enough so it's not too hard to move it from place to place. I really love that the filter is washable and reusable, because there's a few other devices that require purchasing a new filter which can start adding up fast.

Modern A/C unit

  I've been very pleased with my purchase of this a/c unit. The setup was fairly easy with help from the manual. Getting the wifi setup also was pretty easy thanks to the included QR code.It can be alittle noisey when it's first starting up the compressor. I noticed putting it in AUTO mode seems to keep the fan going at all times and the compressor will kick on when needed. Because there's always a sound I tend to prefer this mode rather than silence and then a loud rumble experience you get with COOL mode. I imagine AUTO might use more power though.I REALLY dislike the remote control and its always on screen. Always on, but it doesn't update the temp with the a/c unit and/or app which annoys me. With the exception of FOLLOW ME, everything can be done via the app thankfully.I also wish the sound when making changes could be lowered in volume.Will update review if a need arises.Side note: I bought this as a Deal of the Day and it was $120 cheaper than current price. It's more BTUs than I needed/would pay for at current price.

Worst Purchase of the Year.

  I bought this for my grow room which is about 200 sq ft. It never worked great but after a few months it just kept beeping over and over, constantly asking for a clean filter. My plants have been unable to fruit, I cant run lights, its 95 in there with a few leds going at 830pm in the NE rn. I bought an 8000 btu for $80 less that actually works. Not this one, im so tired of the constant beeping and after investing thousands into my plants and even setting up an insulated duct nothing gets this thing to work. Also while it allows me to control it with all the sophistication of the app, it cant be bothered to allowed me to even make a temperature schedule for my plants. I was so proud of my plants and now im embarrassed because they are all dieing and I have to constantly give them water since this product cant keep the room cool even with just my LED lights out, my HID lights are out of the question. This product was my introduction to smart home products and I feel cheated, no surprise the price has dropped so much. Products like this give a bad name to Amazon and smart home products IMO, I usually enjoy my purchases but I got burnt this time and so did my plants, I cant wait for winter. Then I can get a break from constant beeping, watering and sweeping up the dead leafs.

Suitable to cool basement family room

  These days our family is staying mostly at home, so we needed a large area where the children could run free, and play at will without breaking anything. Also, where they could watch their videos, and play their games. Therefore, we remodeled the basement, which is a nice and large room. But it has a problem, small windows. This is the reason I ordered this Midea Smart 3-in-1 Portable Air Conditioner, because a regular window unit wouldn't do. And I'm glad that I did, because this portable air conditioner is easy to install, and it truly cool the whole room.

Very happy, recommend, & only a couple minor cons
","

  First, this thing cranks out cool air. We bought it as a replacement for a slightly weaker off brand unit. It is also a lot quieter than our previous standing AC, which was a nice surprise. It is about the same noise as a fan on high with the underlying base from the AC unit on.Be sure to cover or wrap the exhaust tubing with reflective material. This helps tremendously on any standing AC unit. So many negative reviews because people don't know to wrap or cover the tubing to keep the heat flowing outside.It's fairly easy to roll around. The cord is a decent length and the plastic window insert to hold the exhaust tube is very adjustable for even a larger width or height depending on your windows. Our windows are side sliders & it's 57"" from top to bottom of our slider. We could adjust the slider to fill the whole gap!The remote is pretty basic. The LED screen stays on constantly so I worry it may run thru batteries. It has a temp sensor so the AC doesn't think the room is cool and turn off too quickly. The app is very handy once you get it setup. Better than that remote IMO.Cons: (I break them out but they really are minor compare to how well it works.)The app setup is confusing and the type of device options arent accurate. We have a standing unit but had to go under ""window unit"" to get the proper setup instructions. TIP: When using the app to sett up the WiFi connection on the unit, TEMPORARILY TURN OFF YOUR CELLPHONE'S LTE DATA CONNECTION. This caused the WiFi syncing to constantly fail. Once past that, setup is super easy. It's Alexa and Google speaker ready and the Google version works really well.The ambient temperature in the room doesn't display anywhere on the unit or the remote. It ONLY displays in the app, once the device is setup. This is minor but annoying as hell. The digital readout on the device is also very hard to see. The plastic cover makes it very dim. In bright light you simply cannot read it. However, it's very easy to read on the remote.The window slider doesn't come with enough plastic bolts to hold it together. This was a head scratcher for sure. You get 3, not 4 or 6, but 3.  We used our own screws so it's workable, but if you need to stand it up in a side sliding window like ours, prepare to be annoyed a wee bit. LololCaveat: we do not plan to use the dry/dehumidifier option so have zero feedback on that aspect. Thiuf it does come with a tray and a short vent hose.Overall, this is a yes buy for apts or single open space rooms up to 500sg ft. We are really happy with it.

  Midea Smart 3-in1 Portable Air Conditioner 12,000 BTU for rooms up to 275sq ft.This portable air conditioner cools a 150 square foot room nicely. It took about 30 minutes to cool the space from 85 degrees down to 70. When the compressor turns on it is a bit loud, but didn’t wake me up or keep me awake at night. It is a portable AC unit so I didn’t expect it to be as quiet as central air. Once it reaches the desired temperate the fan continues to run keeping the room cool. The fan is relatively quiet and the compressor doesn’t turn on all that often. The LED screen is easy to read, but not so bright it lights up the room at night. There is also an option to turn off the LED lights.Installation is very easy with no tools required. Removable filters are a great feature and are very easy to clean. Having filters around the condensing coils is a big plus, as it will reduce maintenance and extend the life of the unit. I live in a dry climate and after running the unit for 5 days I haven’t had to drain the water. Unit moves easily from one room to another.Setting the louvers on the front to swing mode allows the airflow to rotate. This is a nice change from other units I’ve had that only blow air in one direction. The airflow with just the fan running is strong enough to gently move a ceiling fan.The remote is easy to use and can control nearly all features. The remote is especially useful when I’m in bed and want to adjust the temperature.  This is a “smart” unit that can be controlled via WiFi with Alexa or the Midea app. Reviews on the Midea app are not great so I didn’t bother setting it up. I’m not comfortable having appliances turn on when I’m not home, so I don’t see myself setting timers to turn the unit on when I’m not in the house.This unit has a lot of features and it honestly works really well in auto mode.

Better choice than the LG one I already had
","

  This review is for model MAP12S1CWT, which is for rooms up to 275 sq ft.  I am comparing it to the LG brand LP1419IVSM which I already had.  (I love my LG washer and dryer, but not the portable air conditioner).I found this Midea to cool as well as the LG, even though it is rated for somewhat fewer BTU/hr  (9,000-15,500 for the LG; 7,400 – 12,000 for this Midea).  On the low setting, the LG is quieter, but on the high setting the LG is louder and that is a major drawback to me.  Since this Midea is notably cheaper, it’s the obvious choice of the two, to me.But that’s JustMe.  (I received this product in exchange for an honest review, and that is what I have offered here.)

Powerful, Easy to use, Well-made, Looks nice. Few exhaust options. Filter is a screen. Not quiet.
","

  Summary: This powerful air conditioner is keeping my 400 sf non-insulated garage cool during a heat wave! The remote and app make it easy to use. It is sturdily made, the wheels are convenient, and it looks nice. However, the exhaust system can only fit a sliding window, using a non-insulated window-panel with no outside extension. The filter is just a screen. It is inconvenient to drain. And it is as loud as a window air conditioner.My experience: Once I wrestled this 70 pound air conditioning unit into my garage, it was easy to maneuver on strong small wheels with a low center of gravity so it does not tip over too easily. I plugged it into a normal household outlet, and it ran fine. The unit has a nice modern look, and it feels sturdy and non-breakable. The app was as easy to install, but my wifi is weak in my garage, so I am using the physical remote, which works fine. It is doing a great job, and even though I have the 12000 BTU model, it is doing fine keeping my non-insulated 400 square foot garage at a comfortable temperature during outside temperatures over 90 F this week.Why only 4 stars? I would give it 5 stars for it’s power alone, and it has features that I appreciate. But I find two issues that bother me. The hot air exhaust is a typical round hose with a rectangular non-insulated window-frame panel and no external extension of the hose. So it only fits one type of window. On a hot day, a lot of heat is coming through that panel, especially because the hot exhaust air cannot be diverted farther from the window. Also, the filter is really just a screen, which does very little for air quality. It will take large particles and fibers out of the air, but it does nothing about allergens or odors, and it misses a lot of dust.Other suggestions for improvements: Larger wheels would make it easier to move this 70 lb unit on uneven surfaces. Drainage could be made more convenient. Provide a bluetooth option, or improve the sensitivity of the wifi receiver so the app can be used with weak wifi. Finally, i have had quiet window units, and i dont know how they do it, but this would be much nicer if it were quieter.Dont get me wrong. I like this air conditioner, and i am happy at the improvement to my garage workspace. I would like it better if they had tried a little harder to make it better than the rest.

A very good in-room portable AC unit
","

  Very well made. The remote is like a piece of art; it's that nice. The AC unit installed without a hitch. Materials are very good. It is heavy though, and if you have something other than a 10X10 room, you will need a bigger unit. But this works very well for a small room. Yes, it makes a bit more noise than a window unit but it's not obnoxious in the least. I strongly suggest that you put the included drain hose on the back and put the other end a small bucket. Draining this unit of water any other way involves some hefty lifting and possible back strain. But if your windows are too small for a standard AC unit, this is a terrific solution.

Finally, a cold living room
","

  Bought this for the living room since there is no space between the ceiling and the roof (the ceiling is literally the underside of the roof) in a couple places in our home. So we always lose all the cold air from the house and it's impossible to keep it cool on hot Texas days. This helped bring down the temperature a LOT and so now our house actually feels cool, and the living feels COLD!

  Since I purchased an Amazon brand portable AC of similar size.  and price last month, I expect the similar unit This brand is beyond my expectation! The window pieces are solid, more sizes to fit all different windows in my house,  and seal tightly. This means better insulation and cooling efficiency.  I can tell this one is quieter.This is my first piece of Midea brand appliance and I will choose this brand for my next home appliance.

","

  I have a portable AC made by Amazon and one by DeLonghi. The Amazon one was my favorite until I received this one. It is very similar to Amazon's but it adds a few features that push it over the top. The DeLonghi makes too much noise, beyond that of a portable AC and is not even a consideration.This AC unit has louvers on the front, not the top, which does a much better job of air distribution. The louvers are also larger than on any of the other machines,The setup was quick and easy. The piece that goes in the window was very easy to put in place - just slightly wider than the Amazon model and again, the DeLonghi is not even in the running here. Once the piece was placed in the window., it stayed right where I needed it before and after I closed the window in the top Because the machine will be used infrequently, I simply placed the weatherstripping in the visible cracks and blocked the opening to keep the cold air in and bugs out.The app never did install on my phone because it kept failing during the 2nd step. These apps always magically work after a few attempts but for me, there is no real reason to install the app. The remote works great and that is all I needed. I do like that the machine offers the use of Google and Alexa for those who use it and provides an app. For voice and app, the instructions are very clear and easy to follow.

   Here is my feedback about portable AC- packaging was good and it came without any dent or issues- installation instructions are fine and can be followed- It does the job of cooling- overall style looks goodOther things to keep in mind- overall idea of portable ac is confusing. To port this ac to another room you have to move windows exhaust installation. This should be highlighted even though looks like all portable AC works the same way . I did this research after taking- wireless connection for app works on 2.4 GHz connection . Check the picture.  This one is difficult as in today’s world new router does not work on 2.4 GHz

  This AC is fantastic! We have had multiple portable air conditioners in the past and they have all worked okay but this one far exceeded our expectations. It is smaller that comparable ones we have used in the past with comparable output and also lighter. The remote is nice but the WiFi controls are where it really shines. We went out of town for a couple days and were able to keep the house a comfortable temperature for our pets thanks to the app controls. They allow you so see the settings of the unit (current temperature, fan speed, etc) as well as the current ambient temp around the AC. While not completely silent, this AC is quite a bit quieter than our past portable units and can be used in the middle of our living room with minimal disruption. I would highly recommend this unit if anyone is looking for a solid, very capable way to cool a portion of their house.

  We have ductless AC in our house but were limited to setting up 4 units, so one bedroom didn’t get one. Unfortunately the window is high up and it also has a cat perch attached, so a window AC doesn’t work there. This was the perfect solution to control the temperature in that room!The set up was fairly easy although we couldn’t set it up exactly as the directions said. The unit works with no issues and is straightforward. Setting up the app was a bit more difficult as the Alexa app wasn’t finding it when I went to find new device. But I downloaded the Midea Air app and it works well.

  This is my 3rd portable AC in 6 years and this one by far really is the best.  My room cools off much more quicker than the last 2. Our garage was converted into a play room so we use the portable ACs to cool it off.  We run the units quite frequently so the kids are cool.  I am not exaggerating when I say in a matter of minutes i can feel the difference in temperatures.  I am assuming that since my husband connected the 2 prior units he has become a pro at putting them together because he didn't complain at all and he was done in no time at all.Yes, the most important feature to the AC is that it really cools off the hot room BUT another great feature is just how quiet it is when it is running.  It is barely a whisper and I am most appreciative to that fact because the last one we had 3 months ago was annoyingly loud and it was a MAJOR name brand.  This little baby just purrs and it puts out cold air so just saying that is a solid 5 star rating for me.Although I am already satisfied enough to give it 5 stars, there are other features that would make it a 5+++ rating.  To start, I have NEVER heard of a portable AC that could be controlled via an app.  What a great  idea to have the room cooled off prior to the grand kids heading there to play.  I'm still in aweThe control panel is easy to read.  Everything is self explanatory.  This may sound like a no brainer but the one we just got rid of had codes, buttons and gadgets that didn't make sense.The unit itself is nicely made.  It looks good, very sleek and it rolls.  It looks good enough to put in my living room if I needed one there.  It 's kid friendly, I don't see any hazardous parts and there are no rough edges anywhere.  Everything about the AC screams impressive from the look to its functionality.  I've had it for about a month and I am totally pleased, 100% pleased and simply beyond pleased.

Midea AC's are the way to go!!
","

  I will never use any other brand for AC's after having used Midea. My house is over 150 years old and needs an update. We have no central heating/ac so in summer time we use window units. They make it comfortable but in all the years I've lived here and all the many AC's we've bought I've NEVER had one cool a room as quickly and efficiently as this Midea brand. My Midea window unit is whisper quiet and I wondered if this portable AC would be as well.....it is! If you tune in you're going to hear it but it's a white noise that I don't ever pick out of the crowd of noises in my home. I'm not savvy with set-ups of any kind but I was able to set this one up myself. I had to have my son carry it - the box says it weighs 69 lbs. This is in his room - an attic converted into a bedroom that needs new insulation. It's always hot up there. Always. But not anymore. Within 15 minutes we felt cool, and within a half hour the room was cooler than we've ever been able to get it with our other portable AC units. If you're shopping for an AC unit you want THIS brand. Some states are even offering rebates for Midea's AC's. This is a smart ac however, that's the one feature we don't use. We control ours manually and it works just fine. I couldn't ask for more with this product. I love it and I love what it does for me! It works hard to keep my family cool and I'm beyond happy with it.

  PROS:Effective coolingEasy physical set upSimple to useEasy to use control panelServiceable remoteHose connects firmly and does not disconnectWi-Fi AppAlexa compatibility (with some limitations)CONS:Loud when compressor is activeHeavyVery short drainage hose supplied for dehumidify modeWonky Wi-Fi set up--app set up can only be done with 2.4 GHz Wi-FiLimited control/immature appNo laptop or online interface--app control onlyNeeds to be about a foot away from the wallLouvers swing up and down; no way to direct cool air side to sideOVERVIEWThe Midea portable air conditioner is an effective portable air conditioner. On the high side, it effectively cools up to a 350 square foot room and is easy to operate.  On the downside, it is a very heavy unit, is loud, and Wi-Fi was difficult to set up.WHAT'S IN THE BOXThe unit comes with a hose adapter, window slider adapter, exhaust hose, window slider, various foam seals, short drain hose and drain hose adapter, a remote control, and a user's manual.THE AIR CONDITIONERThis is a very nice looking air conditioner.  It is 29 inches high, 17 inches wide, and 13"" in depth at its thickest point.  I did not weigh the air conditioner, but it is quite heavy.  It is rated at nearly 68 pounds by Amazon, but I think some of the shipping weight was due to the packaging and accessories.  Still, it probably weighs in in the 60-65 pound range so it is a bit of a bear to carry around.  It does have two handles on the sides, but given the bulk it is still difficult to carry.  That said, it is lighter than my older Penguino unit and, unlike the Penguino, it rolls freely on it's integrated wheels.  So once you get it on the right level of your house, it's easy to move from room to room, eon hard wood or on low pile carpet.Atop, there is a control panel that utilizes green LEDs, buttons for each display.  There is an LED number display for the temperature setting.  The controls are well layed out, easy to use, and make a lot of sense.The back of the unit has the exhaust hose port and the port for water drainage (which is covered).  The front has the vents (louvers) to direct the cool air.  These can be positioned as just open or can swing up and down.  (There is no way to direct air side to side.)The remote control (batteries included!), is an old-style remote with an LCD temperature display, and also is well layed out and easy to use.SET UPBasically, you attach the connectors to the hose.  Fit the slider in the window of your choice.  Attache the hose to the exhaust port and the other end into the window slider port.  Both hose ports ports have secure connections.  On my much older Penguino brand, the hose connections were a major problem. The either the connector would disengage from the window or the unit or the hose would flip out out the connector.  The Midea system is much, much better in this respect.PLEASE NOTE: given that the hose exits from the back and needs to curl around to attach to the window, the unit cannot fit flush with the wall.  The unit ends up sitting ~ 1 foot from the wall due to hose related issues and the unit is already 13"" deep.  If you orient it face forward, it will stick out about 25"" from the wall, so you need to account for this.  If you decide to have it face sideways (may make it a little more difficult to access the controls), it would still stick out at least 17"", as it is 17"" wide.  At some point, it would be great if manufacturers of these units would have the exhaust ports on the side, so the unit could sit flush with the wall.  (To avoid the need for left handed or right handed unit, they could make an exhaust port on the side with a lever to direct the air on one side or the other.)Unlike a standard window unit, setting this up in a window is a breeze.  You do not have  to position a very heavy air conditioning unit or secure the window.  The slider simply sits on the sill and you expand it.  You can still move the window up and down.  If you are connecting the air conditioner on a ground floor, you may need to secure the window so that no one will break in, but there is no need to secure the window so that your air conditioner will not fall to the ground. By the same token, it's easy to roll the air conditioner to another location and set it up in a different window.If you decide to use this as a dehumidifier only, you will need to buy a longer drain hose.  The hose that is supplied is only two feet long. This is way too short for any set up I could think of.COOLING/USEI was really impressed at how well it cools.  The device is rated at 14,000 BTU (ASHRE) or 8200 BTU (SACC standard). I would say, as a rule of thumb, that these free standing devices never quite cool as well per BTU as their in-the-window relatives.  My older free standing device is rated at 12,000 BTU, however, and this unit knocks the pants off of it.  It seems to cool our room with the same efficacy as a window unit rated at ~8000 BTU if this helps.Settings include:1) Mode: Auto, cool, dry (dehumidify only), fan2) Fan: Auto, high, mid, low (the fan will usually just kick in when needed; you can opt to keep it on constantly by pressing the fan button for three seconds)3) Temperature Setting: you can set the goal temperature for coling modes4) Swing: control the vent louvers to either stay stationary and push air forward or to swing up and down (there is no right to left swing option)Wireless: this activates the Wi-Fi and is needed for set up only5) Sleep Mode: this will lower the air conditioning overnight for a period; the curve is preset.  You can adjust it but only using the app.6) Timer: you can set the timer by pressing the timer button and selecting the time to shut off using the temperature control LEDs7) Additionally, you can set the LED lights as always on or off using either the handheld remote or the app (there is no LED control on the unit's control panel)8) You can set schedules using the app, but not on the unit itselfAll features work as you would expect them to.  There is no 'Eco' setting per se, but the Auto setting works well to keep the room cool and turn off the air conditioner when it is not needed.  As above, at default the fan will shut off when not needed; if you prefer to have it on constantly you can press the fan button for three seconds.  There is an indicator light to show that the fan is on constant mode.The controls on the control panel are set up logically and--at least for a modern, Wi-Fi capable device seem a little retro/90s, but they absolutely work and it is very easy to see the settings and what you are doing.Cooling is excellent and the auto mode functions as is expected. I have set the device up for use as an air conditioner (not as a dehumidifier) so I have not connected the drain hose.  The unit still works well in dry (dehumidify) mode and I have had no problems or errors.  I'm assuming that the moisture is vented through the exhaust port but if you are only using it as a dehumidifier, your exhaust port would not be connected to a window and you'd need a drain connected.  Well, at any rate, no errors or problems in any mode...NOISE:When the compressor kicks in fully, the air conditioner puts out 65-70 dB of noise.  Realize that 70 dB is actually twice the loudness of 60 dB.  So you go from the equivalent of 'conversation in a restaurant' to 'vacuum cleaner' when the compressor really kicks in.  At baseline, the thing is down around 50 dB which is tolerable.The problem, of course, is when you are sleeping at night.  The thing is humming, pleasantly, around 50 dB and you are sleeping.  At some point, the compressor kicks in at 65-70 dB and the change is loud enough to wake you up.  Remember, as well, that dB levels do not account for the quality of the sound.  The compressor kick in is a two parter, with a higher pitch whine followed by a mechanical thud and low pitch hum when it goes into full gear.I can sleep through anything, but not so much my wife.  We've decided that in a very hot summer, it is still easier to sleep with the noise than the humidity and the heat, but before buying this unit, you should take this into consideration.WONKY WI-FI SET UP/2.4 GHZ vs. 5 GHZ WI-FI ISSUESWi-Fi set up was a challenge for me.  It took me quite some time to figure out the problem, but the major issue is that you can ONLY set up the Wi-Fi app on a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signal.  The more modern 5 GHz Wi-Fi will NOT work for set up. (Although, once everything was set up, the app worked on all devices.)The quick solution--set it up on an Android phone after you go into settings and restrict the signal to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi only.In all fairness, the app warns you, but: 1) it really didn't register for me that this would be a problem, as both my iPhone and router work on both frequencies (you'd think the app would self adjust); 2) the app goes through all the steps (and man, does that take time) and then only tanks at the end when you reach 99% set up; 3) the app does not self adjust the frequency on your phone AND does not tell you how or point you in the direction of how to solve the problem.I really had a hard time with this.  For one, I have a modern router that works on both 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, but--wouldn't cha know--I could not figure out how to get either my iPhone or router to only play in the 2.4 GHz frequency range while I was setting up. And, yes.  I tried.Although my computer detects two networks from my router, one for each band, my iPhone only shows one network.  In an effort to 'keep things simple,' there is apparently no setting to restrict to 2.4 GHz only.  Ditto for my Netgear MR60 router--there are a gazillion settings for just about everything but none to cut off the 5 GHz signal and work on 2.4 GHz alone.  Why?  I don't know.  Why would the app not adjust the Wi-Fi to work with the proper signal?  I don't know.  Why would the app connect to a 5 GHz signal and not error before it 'tried' to connect.  I don't know.  Given that 5 GHz is the modern standard, they should upgrade their hardware or at least get the software to settle conflicts automatically.Before giving up, I used my wife's Android phone to try to set up.  At first, it also didn't work.  Then I went into settings and, lo and behold, the folks at Android give you the option to only work at 2.4 GHz.  The app still took a long time to set up the Wi-Fi, but it worked.It would have been even better if the company provided a web portal to set up the Wi-Fi.  This would make it a lot easier to get set up.  For whatever reason, tech companies seem to think that phone apps are more 'hip' and 'now.'  That said, there are still some things that might be easier on a computer...APP OPTIONS:The app is a nice touch, but it's function is limited.  You can turn the device on and off remotely, so if you are coming home you can restart your AC from your car so that when you arrive the house is cool.  You can set mode (Auto, Cool, Dry, etc.), fan speed, the flap movement, and turn on and off the LED lights.You can set an on-off schedule that is different for each day. The system is a little convoluted but once you get the hang of it it is doable.  You can also set the 'sleep curve' to adjust the temperature overnight, after you fall asleep.  This is a little more intuitive, but will not vary from day to day.Again, a web-based interface on a laptop would likely be easier to use than a phone app.Interestingly, Midea appears to make the Toshiba line of Wi-Fi air conditioners.  So if you own both Midea and Toshiba Wi-Fi air conditioners, you can use either the Midea or Toshiba app to connect all of your air conditioners within the same app.ALEXA:Once I set up the Wi-Fi, setting up Alexa was really not a big deal.  The problem with Alexa, for me, was getting Alexa to respond correctly.  First, you have a limited series of commands.  You can turn the unit on, turn it off, and change the temperature.  That's pretty much it.As with many things Alexa, you have to phrase it correctly (e.g. 'Alexa ask my dear air to turn on air conditioner').  Alexa seems to have problems with 'Midea air' (e.g. 'my dear air').  As above, Midea also makes Toshiba's line of air conditioners.  I switched to the Toshiba app because Alexa seems to have fewer problems with the word Toshiba, s o you get a more consistent response to the 'Alexa, ask Toshiba to turn on air conditioner' command. Moreover, with the Toshiba app, you can just say, 'Alexa, turn on Master Bedroom,' and Alexa knows what that means.CONCLUSION:This unit has its ups and downs but actually functions really well as an air conditioner.  Highs include the cooling capacity and the variety of functions.  Lows include noise levels and an app that could use an upgrade (and could be easier to install).  The device is heavy as well, but this is par for the course with this kind of air conditioner.  If I could change one thing about this unit, I would want them to find a way to cut back on the noise.All-in-all, I am satisfied with this device. It performs as well or better than similar, free standing, portable air conditioners and has advanced features.

Cools nicely but there's a chemical smell
","

  Strange chemically smell coming from AC. It almost hurts my nose. Is it because it's new?And I know it's from the AC because the minute I turned it on in my room, it started to smell. I'll give it a few more days to see if the smell goes away. I've never owned a portable air conditioner but I'd like to say the placement of the drain is very inconvenient for a portable air conditioner. It has two drains, one for the dehumidifier mode and the other for AC. The AC one is all the way at the bottom. Take note that this portable AC is kinda heavy if you want to lift and put it at a higher lever to drain the water. aC cool air will stop cooling when it's time to drain the water you will see the display say (P1) and at that moment it will switch to fan mode.Or you can remove it from the window hose and then take it outdoors to drain the water.Noise level is tolerable for me . Cools nicely (my room is 120 SQ ft) remote control is convenient to have when it's time to go to bed**** So as I was writing my review, within less than an hour, I had it set to 70 degrees the P1 came on the display so now it's just blowing regular air. Had. To dump out water for AC function to wait to again. You should probably look into purchasing a window AC instead. Much more convenient.

Portable- Works Automatically and uses standard 110 VAC power
","

  I like the MIDEA MAP 14S1CWT AIR CONDITIONER, FAN and DEHUMIDIFIER as it is PORTABLE on wheels and plugs into a standard wall 110 volt power wall outlet. The three functions in one system is a bonus feature for us.We live on a lake in the south.  Humidity and heat are normal for our area and not all parts of our house receive sufficient cooling. The MIDEA portable Air Conditioner solved the problem for us.  We can move the unit to the room that requires cooling. The unit is on wheels, has handle cup indentations on each side and is no problem to move on hard or carpet floors. There is a similar grab hold on the rear.Operation is by a control panel on the top, Remote Control or Alexa. The VENT panels on the front of the unit are power operated.  They are are controlled and direct the air through use of the control panel.  There is a temperature preset that can be used to maintain the same cooling output. Different fan speeds are available. The FAN can be set for Automatic or individual selection of low, medium and high. The same with Operation. We can select Automatic, Cool, Dry or plain Fan. The Timer can be set or switched OFF. It is really cool to watch the cooling vent work ( move ) automatically!Two drain plugs are on the rear of the unit.  A certain amount of moisture can be captured inside the unit but when needed to empty these two outlets are available. The outlet will accept a standard hose if I use the unit in one of the areas that has a runoff for the water. I was concerned about power draw on single circuit with other devices in use. There have been no issues with hours of operation in hot and humid conditions.  We are pleased.Recommended  Five  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  StarThank you for looking at my review.

Fundamentally flawed design, but its nice aside from that
","

  For extremely short term use, or use in small bursts in a localized area, this is a perfectly fine air conditioner. The app is a bit annoying, having you sign in every time you open it, but everything works nicely for the most part.The big problem with this AC and all the others like this, is that it is sucking in room temperature air, blowing it outside, and forcing the hot outside air right back into the room to make up for the difference. This is immensely less efficient than having two tubes - one bringing in air to blow over the hot coils and another expelling the hotter outside air back outside. This means that if you use this in one room of your house, it will make the rest of your house warmer as it sucks in air from outside. I have no idea why so many air conditioners go for this design when a second hose would fix the issue completely. I feel like it deserves low stars because of this alone, but luckily for this unit, it does everything else well.The unit is about as quiet as you could expect it to be, with the sound of the blowing air being almost as loud as the compressor itself. Every setting change takes a second to make its way to the unit, but I haven't had the unit miss a command yet (aside from not pointing the remote directly at it). It cools well, but you may need to set it a few degrees below the temperature you really want (my 80F room would be seen by the unit as 77). If I leave it on long enough and consistently enough, it'll keep the 100sqft room cool, but the fact that I can feel warm air rushing into the room from any available cracks annoys me to no end.If you want a well designed AC, look for one with two tubes, please. If you don't care about anyone else in your building or the bill, and you're determined to get a single-tube unit for some reason, then this is probably a better option than most.

Finally a smart AC
","

  The integration with Alexa is exactly what I needed. I was able to connect to my smart AC seamlessly and control the temperature through Alexa. I had a non smart portable AC before and it got annoying having to find the remote all the time.Of course the most important feature is the cooling and it excels in that. We use it for our bedroom and it has no trouble bringing the room down to a comfortable temperature for us.One of the drawbacks for some could be the noise. For me it’s perfect because I enjoy the white noise for sleeping but my girlfriend prefers perfect silence. She’s getting used to it and although it is not obnoxiously loud, it is definitely not silent. But again, if you’re like me and you like sleeping to some background noise while nice and cool, as well as in the process of adding to your smart home appliances, then this is the perfect addition for me.

Easy to install and very sleek looking. Had had it for a month and only cleaned the filter once (it didn’t even seem like it needed it yet). If anything I would say it’s compact but kind of heavy.  I had to take it upstairs by myself so it’s a workout! Still worth every dollar! I haven’t had to drain it yet and I’ve read reviews that some people own them for years before they drain them.

More of the white noise of a fan that drowns out the sounds of street noise. It actually helps me sleep better but for those that don't like that kind of noise it is not silent.

When a Portable Unit is Your Only Choice
","

  In the hierarchy of air conditioning, these single hose portable units are almost at the bottom in terms of efficiency. Mini splits, window units, and dual hose portable units are all better choices, but sometimes these are the only choice.This unit from Midea is a good one. The power cord includes it's own breaker which is a nice safety feature. The 6-inch exhaust hose, hose fittings, and window attachment hardware are all excellent and easy to set up. It would have been nice to include a wall mount flange with a round hose adapter for wall venting, but it's pretty easy to DIY with 6-inch duct parts if you are handy.The remote control is brilliant and features a large easy to read LCD with the temp, mode, and fan speed settings. The temp display on the top of the unit itself is the exact opposite, very dim and difficult to read. Not a big deal as it still works, but seems like an oversight in design.The exhaust hose stays hot while this unit is running, that's a good sign and tells us it's removing heat from the room. Cools down a 350 sqft garage in the summer but doesn't seem to help much with humidity. Paired with a dehumidifier (which creates heat in the room) this A/C unit struggles to keep up with the cooling. Probably a bit much to ask from a portable unit like this.Overall very pleased. This review will be updated if any long term issues arise.

midea portable air conditioner
","

  This portable air conditioner came well packaged, with all the necessary accessories for installation. I found it to be surprisingly heavy and bulky despite it being on wheels. The assembly was pretty easy, and I had no issues with it. The instructions booklet was well done.The remote control came in handy. I wish the buttons were a little bigger, but it worked okay. Not perfectly, but was mostly responsive when I used it. I changed the temperature on the remote control, which lit up every time I changed it, which I found convenient. For some reason, the temperature display on the air conditioner was darker and the numbers were kind of foggy and harder to make out (even after I peeled the thin film off the control panel) than on the remote control.I noticed that every time I turned the unit on, the horizontal louver blades opened, and when I turned the unit off, they automatically closed, which I found helpful for safety reasons. This air conditioner cooled down my small room well, and so far I had no problems with it.

OK when you have to have a portable unit
","

  If you must have a portable AC unit, this is a decent unit.Positives include:* Cools the room.  Does what we need it to do.* Very easy to install.  Pick your window, find the right combination of window inserts, attach foam weather stripping, and connect hose to unit and window insert.  Super easy.* Digital controls.  Allowing programming of when the unit comes on.* Remote included.  Sort of bulky but nice to have.* WiFi connection and app.* Washable filters (though we’ve yet to do this)* Modern, handsome appearance.  Obviously personal taste but it does have a nicer look than you average plain-Jane utilitarian appliance.Cons:* You have to empty the water reservoirs.  There are two with one drain plug located at about the middle of the rear panel on the unit and the other located near the bottom of the unit.  The bottom plug is a pain to empty because you really can't get pan other than a cookie sheet to fit under the plug.  So this turns draining the unit into a two-person exercise or needing to find a low stool to set the unit on so you can get a bigger pan in it.  I find this whole process to be a pain but in reality it's like this for all portable units.* Instructions.  Pure trash.  I still have no idea how to program this thing so it will come on at night and turn off in the morning as this is purely a bedroom machine for us.  It can do it, but having to watch an internet video to figure it out is terrible.Summary:Outside of the instructions being pretty much worthless, this unit does what we need it to do which is make our son's room comfortable enough for him to be able to sleep.  That said, other than the curb factor window units are more efficient, self-draining, and cool better.  But if you hate the idea of a window unit, have windows that make installing one difficult or difficult to seal (our problem), this is a decent unit that works for the space it was intended.

  Let me get the one little flaw out of the way first. The LCD digits on the front of the display are VERY dim. They are virtually impossible to read. I'll continue to see if I can find an adjustment, but you have the remote control to fall back on, so it is hardly a deal breaker.That aside, I love everything else about this air conditioner. It is about as portable as you can expect. Casters come mounted out of the box so it is very easy to roll around.The unit gets COLD. I've used it in a screened in porch in 100 degree heat. I wasn't expecting much, but it did a great job making it reasonably comfortable. Move it to the garage and it is even better.It produces some condensation, but not so much that it's going to flood anything. You definitely need to vent it somewhere, as there is a lot of hot air output. Nothing unexpected, but you can't just close the room off and let it rip.The remote control is great. Allows you to easily adjust the temp without having to get up. I wish it did allow you to kick off the swing function that fans the air up and down, but I can live without it.I haven't had an opportunity to experiment with the Alexa function yet, so I'll have to update my review later. Based on the quality of the rest of the product, I'm sure it will work very well.Midea has made a believer out of me! These units are very effective and compact!

  I fully believe that many of the complaints in reviews for this product may be people's lack of reading or understanding the directions.  And perhaps the fact that having multiple sizes of products with different sizes also touting different features may have also confused a lot of the buyers.  It also appears that these problems dog other manufacturers of portable AC units from looking at some other product reviews.  Note that this review is for the largest model in the lineup, which as far as I can tell sports all the available features.First, just know this:  for cooling mode, you can set the fan to low, med, or high, and you can also keep it on constantly so that it doesn't go off and on with the compressor.  And mine was surprisingly quiet even on high - much, much better than AC units at low to mid range hotels.  And it is a very steady noise, no rattling or anything like that, so it probably measures much lower in sones than it does in decibels.  And being able to put it on constant is very important (that feature is not available for all modes, but it is for cooling).Also, on AC mode, you do NOT need a condensate line.  These things somehow use an evaporative technique presumably similar to refrigerators.  And it seems to still remove some humidity from the space, probably just by blowing it out with the hot air.  I know a bit about refrigeration, but I can't say for sure how exactly that is supposed to work.  They do tell you that extra condensate will temporarily accumulate in the bottom of the unit, and in rare, severe cases, you may have to drain it (I don't see that happening often, but I will admit it would be a major pain for most people given the weight of this thing...and since many people would use it in the bedroom, where would you drain it).If you use it in ""dry""/dehumidification mode, you'll have to hook up a continuous drain, and you'd likely want it in your basement.  If you want that, but a dehumidifier for $100 instead.  It's nice that this is multi-purpose, but normally you'd want both at the same time...not like you need dehumidification in the winter most places.Heat pump mode also needs a drain line, so that could get more complicated.You must vent outside for AC, but NOT for dehumidify.  Tube is too large to go out a 4"" dryer vent, but I understand on some smaller models, you could do that.Overall, I am very pleased with this unit.  I put in a whole-house unit a while back, but I need an AC in my attic when I want to do work in there in the summer months (and I recently changed out a window, which has too small of an opening for the old window unit I kept around).  This thing functions for me exactly how I expected, and I also like having it around as a backup or even as extra cooling for sleeping should I ever decide I need it (because my upstairs is still warmer than downstairs since I designed the HVAC for a heating-dominant geographic location).I was particularly pleased with the installation package.  The window plates are thick and rest inside the frame perfectly.  The foam pieces are great if you are going to keep it in one place all summer long.  The duct shrinks down to about 1 foot long.  They also give you a small bracket to ""lock"" the window, although I've noticed this won't work on my ""double-hung"" attic windows (so you may need a contingency plan if your frames already have something on the sides of the top frame...read the manual and figure it out before you buy if you're concerned about this...it's only two screws anyway, but most windows have pretty cheap locks anyway, so not much difference if you can use the locking kit).I've always hated window units more than anything, since they're so wasteful, ugly, and let so much sound from outside into the interior.  I believe this would do just as good of a job as the giant window unit I used to use downstairs, but it would be so much better in so many ways.  And I could even face it inside better than I could before (used a side window because it's just too ugly to put it out the front).  But of course now it takes up some room inside, which is the only drawback.  And it costs more than window units, I think.  But you can move it around as necessary (although I'll tell you dragging it upstairs to downstairs all the time would get quite old).I personally don't use ""smart"" stuff, but it does appear that the app offers a lot of features, and I think only by getting your unit from a big company specializing in AC like Midea can you get such a robust app for an appliance like this.Overall, I'm very impressed.  I think if you can find a good place to put this, and take the time to install it well, you can have a much nicer experience with this than you would with a window unit.  It's more expensive, but much less so than a mini-split or adding a whole-house system.

Comes with everything required, including window panels
","

  I am amazed a what all this air conditioner can do. After all, I just need one that makes the room cold. This one comes with a remote control and instructions for use with an app. Setup for standard use is intuitive. I had it going within minutes. The unit comes with all the required hoses (one for condensation the dehumidifier mode and one for to expel hot air) as well as panels for installation in a sliding window. I have a 50"" high window that slides horizontally and the panel fits. In fact, I only used three of the four extension panels. The only thing I don't like is that it came with only three pegs for the holes in the extension panels. I needed four, so I made do by using a paperclip in one of the holes. Just stick a paperclip in the hole and it will stay in place.I didn't use the app or the remote control; because those are things I don't ever want or need in an air conditioner. This thing works and it's portable, though heavy. It has wheels to make lugging it around easier. That's all I need.Right now, I'm using this in my home office, which doesn't cool down well with the central AC. Next year, I plan to bring it on a gold mining trip. We usually stay in a ""cabin"" that lacks air conditioning. In triple-digit heat, we will be the envy of the entire campground.

  ok so i’ve been looking for a “smart” ac for a minute & this one is pretty amazing. the noise level is very doable & soothing to me since i like the sound of rain so the light sound it makes it great.the app is very easy to use & the set up connecting to your device & wifi is easy. i can be away from my home & still make sure it’s comfortable when i get there.the remote is easy to use as well but since i have the app it’s barely in use.the easy to clean filters are great! they pop out very easy but not easy to where they can just fall off. just rinse with water & let them air dry & you’re set. i use it often so once a week is a good amount of cleaning.now this thing is not lite weight so the wheels make it super easy to move, & i move it on carpet.all in all let’s just say you get the bang for your buck! i recommend highly

Great & Compact AC
","

  It works well for my garage, as due to corona and the gyms are closed, I had to turn my garage to a home gym and the garage is like inferno over 100 degrees and this AC has been great with help from a few fans. I have had it for about a  month, using it off and on. It’s not the quietest, but not super loud. Alexa integration is great, don’t have to get up to adjust the temperature. It’s sleek and moves easily on wheels. It is made of plastic, so be careful when removing/replacing filter covers. Yet to use the humidifier feature. The only downside is that the swing feature doesn't go down but other wise great Portable AC, I highly recommend it.

Decent portable AC unit. Good for smaller, enclosed rooms.
","

  This MIDEA MAP14S1CWT 3-in-1 Portable Air Conditioner works about as well as most other portable ACs - and if you never owned one before, you'll need to do your research before purchasing them, because they will NOT be as powerful as a window unit (or obviously, central AC), despite claiming to cool the same square footage as one. I personally think everyone should have one of these in their homes, however, even if they have central AC - just as a backup, in case your central AC konks out for any reason in the dead of summer - which is exactly what happened to me.Like most other portable ACs, this claims to cool up to 330 sq ft. Note the ""up to"" part. That is a best case scenario, and the reality is that it will most likely not cover anywhere near that amount - at least, not consistently. The closer you are to the unit, the cooler - and there's a small radius around it that stays that way. Unlike a window unit, which has more blowing power and can pull out the humidity/heat faster (and drain out the moisture far more quickly outside), these are weaker, slower, and cannot handle open spaces very well - especially if you have higher ceilings and your floorplan flows into more square footage. They work well, however, in smaller and fully enclosed rooms - or for people who might have a slightly warmer room in one area of their house and they want some extra cooling on top of what they already have in their central AC. These are nice for bedrooms, small studies, and other rooms where you can close the door, etc. - and they're obviously easier to move around and way more subtle than bulky window units sticking out your window outside. They CAN get a space cool, but it needs to be enclosed in a restricted space in order for them to be effective. They're perfect for temporary situations or as a backup to an already working AC. Outside of that, you're going to be really disappointed with any and all portable ones like this one. I don't feel that it's fair to knock off a bunch of stars for it not doing what it wasn't really designed to do in the first place - but just note that these are limited in what they can do. You're paying for the ease and luxury of portability with these if you are trying to figure out whether to get a window unit or a portable one.This one is no exception to that, but it's certainly better than nothing when you're in a pinch and need AC in a limited space, especially if you're not allowed to have a window unit (or don't want to mess with the hassle of one). If you place this in a smaller room with the door closed and blowing reasonably near your bed, for instance, it will get quite cold. I stuck this in a kids' bedroom so they could be comfortable at night while we were waiting to replace a broken compressor on our central AC unit. It works as well as another name brand we purchased from a brick and mortar store that we placed in another room - but this one was significantly more expensive for doing the same thing the other does, which is why I knocked off a star.Installation is fairly straightforward (just read the instructions and make sure your window can accommodate it), and the wheels roll nicely when you are needing to move it to another location (or for storage). You will need to make sure your window is sealed pretty tightly for best results. The noise level (all portable ones I've tried are very noisy) is the same as other brands we've used - such as Hisense, LG, etc. Yep, it's noisy.The remote is simple to use, and it is pretty comparable in every other way to other brands. I prefer the location of the fins on this one over some other ones, but that's just me - and it seems to dehumidify pretty well on the whole for small spaces. It honestly works about as well as to be expected, and it keeps my kiddo comfy at night, so I'm decently satisfied with it.As with anything, YMMV depending on what your needs are and what you're looking for.

  This really is a MINI personal cooler. Not for a room, should probably only be used at a desk. I was hoping for more power, to be able to cool down a small bedroom or bathroom.

  I once had an original Arctic Chill, and I quite liked it. This product is NOT an Arctic Chill, and design differences are deal breakers. I thought it would be about the same, but it definitely is not. The filter is positioned so that the air just kinda flows past it, not through it, so very little evaporation happens, meaning the air blowing through remains quite hot. Useless. Also, it's LOUD! So essentially, a very expensive, inconvenient, loud and hot fan.  Don't bother.

  I did not find this to even begin to cool off the room I placed it into.  I was sitting across the room about 6 ft. away and could barely feel any cool air from it and I had it pointed directly at me.  You have to be sitting in a chair directly in front of it to feel any of the cool air.  And after freezing the filter, as it is running the filter is thawing and then you have water dripping all over your furniture. This doesn't work well when on wood stands and such.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

  I bought this at Home Depot, but wanted to warn people:It’s a fan. There’s a compartment you fill with cold water, and supposedly the evaporation makes the air cooler.They recommend putting the filter in the freezer. I did that.They recommend using cold water—I did that, I even added ice cubes to it.It wasn’t any cooler than a regular fan.There are videos online where people do the same thing by simply putting frozen water bottles in front of a fan, and even show how the temperature on thermometers goes down.This unit didn’t do this.  It’s just a table top fan. The air that blows out isn’t any cooler than a fan, but you have to fill it, use ice water, use ice: all a waste.Very disappointing product, especially considering the price.

  The people giving this bad ratings obviously aren’t very intelligent or just never payed attention in school. This is NOT an air conditioner, nor is it supposed to be.

As the water in the mist and filter evaporate it takes some of the heat out of the area, basically like a small humidifier, and does a surprisingly good job of it! The light on the top is very nice if you want a small light in a room or just to look neat. And adding ice in the water tank boosts it quite a bit.

  This works, but dont expect a lot. It is small. The fan is pretty much a cpu cooling fan. Using cold water from my fridge, it will cool the air 10 -12 degrees.

The filter will quickly thaw and return to room temp, because it is blowing warm air across it. The construction of this product is ok. All plastic. The cord is detachable but it does not have a rechargeable battery. This is not worth the 40 bucks.

  This fan should work more like a mister the filter pads become kinda useless.  It is nice and cooling as long as the filter has been pre-soaked. Unfortunately the water in the tank is not released sufficiently to keep the filter wet and it dries out very fast. I took out the filter after running it for about 10 minutes and only part of 2 middle filter pads were kind of wet. The rest were bone dry. This product needs to be redesigned so that the water in the tank drips into the filter itself instead of the space between the filter and the fan (you know like a real evaporative cooler).

I woke up about 3 hours after retiring to bed to find that the water reservoir was bone dry.  So while it was pleasant having it on my bedside table when I first fell asleep, it was over quickly.  So maybe this is something that is better to use when you are able to refill it every 2 hours.I was also concerned about hot very hot the plug becomes after a short while of use.The only good thing I can say about this is that it is a very powerful fan for its size. (Maybe that's why the plug gets so hot.) I was doing light plumbing work in my bathroom and brought the cooler in to sit on the toilet in that humid room while I worked it. was a great relief. But note that I did not have to use one drop of water in it.So if you want a good fan, I suppose this is it. But I can't ignore that hot adapter plug.

Better than a small fan

  Bought this little guy hoping for some improvement at my WFH desk.  Have a small 8in fan already but humidity is killing me lately.  So here's my 2 cents:-  This thing is small.  Fan looks the same size as a fan from your Computer.-  Water reservoir is also small, but running it on high w/mist it'll last 6 hrs.-  The ""Swing"" function is nice but it's slow.  I tried it but stopped using it because of its sped.-  I did my own little temp check using a meat thermometer, holding it about 4-5in from fan, and here's the results:  -  My old fan, room @ 87 degrees, fan lowered temp to 81/82  -  This fan, room @ 87 degrees, fan with only water in it, lowered temp to 77/78  -  This fan, room @ 87 degrees, fan with water & ice in it, lowered temp to 71/72So it does work, but you need to be close to it to get the feeling it's working for you.  I have it maybe 18in from me so I feel the cooler air, but this thing in no way is going to cool a room.  I expected this so I give it a 4/5 knowing what my expectations were.  If you buy thinking it'll cool your Bedroom down while you sleep it's not gonna happen.JK

  The air does get cool, but you have to have the unit right next to you to get any relief from it. Very disappointed.

Small.

  Much smaller than I expected.  Sits on nightstand for misting effect.  Only cools air pretty close to you.  Was hoping cool air would reach just a bit further.

  Small enough for a desk or bedside cabinet. The oscillating function is great, it keeps the personal space cool and full of breeze. Quiet for sleeping. Would recommend.

Easy to use

  Very easy to use and it's small and portable so you can move it around easily. It has different fan speeds and even an option for mist and it rotates too. It cools the area that it's blowing in and even then, you'd have to be close to it.

Worth it
","

  It has 3 speeds and able to twist to around. It’s super compact and easy to use and the mist feature is brilliant and helps your skin. Easy to set up and a good air on for a short-range usage. So worth it!

Good looking
","

  A really good looking desktop fan with the most. This purchase was mainly for my office desk and I am so glad I did. The 90-degree oscillation is perfect for my desk as I didn't really want to buy one that has a bigger degree of oscillation because then I don't personally benefit from the cooling as much. It was ready to use from the box once plugged in and works really long time on the tank it has. I really like the settings and find them to be more than enough.

The perfect fan
","

  This unit looks and feels of good quality.The water is stored in an easy to remove the water tray at the front.The functions of the air cooler include timer off (2, 4, and 6 hours) which is handy for use at bedtime, 3-speed settings, rotate and mist on/off.It’s a permanent fitting for these times.

  It's worth the money, for me. I use this product in the living room and sometimes in my bedroom. Once you fill the whole tank of water it can last for a good several hours.  It works better if you put the mist on which I think makes it cooler.

Amazing air cooler fan

  It works brilliantly and keeps me cool. I love how you can spray mist and the tank is easy to remove, refill and pop back in. The LED light on it isn’t too bright so doesn’t brighten up a dark room whilst sleeping.

It blows....
","

  The design is pretty nice and the features are cool, but, please do not be fooled (like me). This is NOT an air conditioner, but rather a small fan with the option of adding ""mist.""I figured I could just add ice cold water or ice cubes to at least chill the mist. But, the directions say not to because it may damage the unit.I am still debating if I should return this thing, but I guess it's better than nothing.

Good value for money

  It is the perfect size for my desk. As I work from home every other day, I needed a small fan. This fan is nice and works well when it's up close to you. It is great for personal use. I can turn the mist on or off depending on what I want and it does have 3-speed settings it is easy to use portable so both I and my sister can fight over it and use it lol. It is oscillating so it can freshen the air and I am very comfortable with air quality. I recommend this product to anyone looking for small fan.

Better than I expected
","

  Simple to use, just put the water into the reservoir/tank and re-insert back into the original placement. You can use this as a fan or a portable AC. It is cool enough and not using a lot of electricity, it comes with 3 different settings and the water mist is making my face comfortable and cool. It is energy efficient. but if you want to cover a large area, you might need a large ac, not a personal size ac. I love it and feel very comfortable without the large ac drying up my skin.

  I purchased this one and it seems I order three products: air cooler, little fan, and humidifier. I like the timer function. It will auto shut off when the time is up.
