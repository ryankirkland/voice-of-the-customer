      "Didn't work, then worked, now don't work again All I got in terms of use out of these batteries were about three days of use out of two of them and have had no additional success. I bought them because I was bleeding through AAA batteries and was hoping the compact design would be better than something more bulky.Right out of the box, I charged them until the light was green indicating they were fully charged, tried to use them in a couple of devices and didn't have any luck. I was going to return them, but my friend suggested I switch from charging in an extension cord to directly in a wall socket. I thought that it did the trick, even though I thought that was silly, when I tried the batteries in a device after letting them charge overnight plugged directly into the wall socket, they did work, and worked well.About three days later, the device stopped working in the middle of high powered usage (hair trimmers). I swapped the batteries I had in there for the other two that had been charging the entire time, and they didn't work. I went out and bought regular AAA batteries and the device went back to working just fine. I tried the batteries in a few other devices and they aren't working. It seems they work just enough to convince you they work, then stop working.I don't often leave feedback on products, but I felt it was important to say here that I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. If not totally faulty, they are at the very least completely inconsistent, and you'd do better just buying disposables.\n",
      "These absolutely suck I bought these for a wall mounted magnifying mirror that has LED lights so you would think it shouldn't be sucking an immense amount of power out of these. If I turn the mirror on long enough to check my makeup and apply mascara I get about 3 uses out of it at 5-10 minutes a piece before these die and have to be recharged again. Opening the mirror to remove them is a PITA so I'm not pleased.\n",
      "longer lasting battery for remote controller!! i like the constant voltage and hopefully it gives off a warning whenever it quits. but some folks who tried that it will last for 8 hrs continuous use and quits after that. i have used it for maybe an hour or less and the voltage still not dropping to 5.95 volts. so it is very good!!\n",
      "Minimal plastic in packaging. Just received these today, but I’m reviewing to say I noticed the minimal use of plastic and appreciate it.\n",
      "Not long enough battery life for a night hike Shuts off suddenly in headlamp\n",
      "So far, I love them! I bought these because we were burning through batteries like crazy in our noise cancelling headphones as a result of working from home. With the four batteries, two are in our headphones and two are charging at any particular time, so when it runs out we just switch. They seem to charge very rapidly as well, much faster that I expected.\n",
      "Never want a disposable AA ever again I didn't realize how barbaric it was to buy single-use batteries for my camera flashes until I got these rechargeable batteries. I can't imagine voluntarily buying a metal canister of heavy metal that I'll throw away in a week ever again. These things are rad.\n",
      "Energy Storage Is Less Than 1/4 Normal Batteries. They do charge quickly, but at what price? It seems the quick charge is due to the fact the total amount of energy stored by these batteries must be very low.  Tested on an efficient Led flashlight expecting to get 8 hours on the low setting as I do with normal batteries, but I only got an hour and a half.  Returning product.\n",
      "Poor Quality - Unreliable I had high hopes for these batteries because the design is a great concept. However, I was very disappointed when I charged up the batteries and placed them in a flashlight and found that two of the batteries quit working after only a few minutes. Amazon offered to send me a replacement and yet I still have had the same issues with the second batch. I have tried using both sets in several different flashlights and have experienced much worse performance with them compared to generic AAA batteries that I bought at the grocery store. I have seen someone else write about a similar experience which leads me to believe that this is a common problem.\n",
      "Get these batteries! I can’t believe that I can love a battery. But I do! I’m replacing all my single use batteries now that I’ve found these guys\n",
      "Excellent rechargable battery that saved me money in 1 month Product works great, LOVE the built in charge indicator. Replaced all the batteries in my high use items: remotes, CHILD'S TOYS, xbox controllers and bathroom scale. Within the first month I saved on disposables.\n",
      "4 stars! Great product, great company communication, a tad pricey, but rechargeable! 4 stars! Great product, great company communication, a tad pricey, but rechargeable so I don't have to constantly buy batteries!I love the usb charger, built-in very convenient. Came with charging cable too!Only issue was delivery from Amazon fulfilment, sent the wrong size - a mislabeled box... not really anyone's fault.Company was amazing at communicating to make it right! Sent the correct size, all good.\n",
      "Best purchase I've made I like that I no longer have to buy batteries again. I've already saved money by purchasing rechargeable batteries. I told several friends they ordered them as well.\n",
      "Great product, slightly to short positive terminal These are great replacements for aaa batteries.  I use them in a Bluetooth mouse, and they have outlasted the batteries I used before.  Only problem is that the positive terminal doesn’t quite stick out far enough to make a connection without modifying (extending) the spring contact point.\n",
      "Great batteries. Great value for the money.  I bought these because I'm tired of throwing away batteries and with all the work from home I've been doing, I needed a rechargeable option for my keyboard, mouse, and game controllers.  These batteries have been great- easy to use and charge.  The LED lights on the batteries indicating charge status is awesome and the 4 in 1 USB charging cable is great.  Overall I'm very happy with the purchase and so far the charge seems to be as good or better than my Duracell disposables.\n",
      "Portable / rechargeable / ready to use Great product, use it for my head lamp.\n",
      "I like these. Very convenient charge. If you're anything like me a frequently forget to turn your noise cancelling headphones off, having rechargeable batteries is v nice.\n",
      "Good for low drain devices Should be better in long run, but nimi batteries last a lot longer but only have 1.2v these have a true 1.5v\n",
      "Convenient for keeping wireless devices from having downtime. I really like these. I haven't been able to test them long term yet, but these are extremely convenient for cycling batteries through my wireless Apple keyboard and mouse. They last just as long as any other battery I've used. I really have no complaints, which isn't something I can say for everything I've purchased during quarantine boredom Amazon shopping.\n",
      "Will buy again Quick charge - use for kids Xbox controllers, they can tell when fully charged\n",
      "Fancy tech, doesn't stay charged long. I love the idea of rechargable and this was one of the few lithium ion ones that are rechargable individually by USB.  It was hard to compare to normal ni-cad rechargable but these seemed more environmentally friendly.  The form factor and convenience are real. The biggest disappointment is the length of time they last.  I use a generic Bluetooth mouse.  Previously I used non-rechargeable Amazon basic batteries. They lasted about 2-3 weeks being used about 9 hrs a day for work.  These batteries last about 2 days for the same use.  The other difference is the normal batteries would slowly die and the mouse cursor would slow down or glitch.  These die instantly. I guess that's the lithium ion experience.  I.e. like your cell phone.  Not sure I would buy these again for something that is more critical for power or harder to change the batteries.  I can't compare to other lithium ion.\n",
      "Quick Charging! I have a couple of kids, and we use a ton of batteries with remote control cars and all the other kid stuff! We also camp a lot, so I have several headlamps that I am continually changing batteries in. These batteries are great! They charge so much faster than others that I have used and can charge them in my truck if need be! The USB charging is fantastic, and I am very happy with the product!\n",
      "Made well and long lasting! These batteries are worth it! Saving the planet, plus I know I’ll always have a fresh set of batteries for my precious tv remote! I also like how you can tell if they are fully charged or not by the red/green light. They seem to last just as long as normal batteries, if not a little longer.\n",
      "Great for Xbox controllers! I bought these as a replacement for my plug and play battery packs and I have really been impressed with the longevity of each charge.  Plan to buy another set for my other two controllers as well.\n",
      "Beware! My order was incomplete The batteries arrived, but without the advertised charging unit. Doesn't do any good to have rechargeable batteries without the charger...  Hopefully, the company will see this, and do the right thing. If so, then I'll advise people that they did. Look for an update....3/30/2020W.\n",
      "Great for everyday Got this for my wireless keyboard and mouse. Works perfect. Charged quickly and was ready to go. Love the USB charging.\n",
      "Strong thoughtful battery product Great quality battery. Yes, it recharges but you won't need to all the time. I've been using these in: wireless freezer and refrigerator temperature sensors, OTC tens unit, flashlights and heated jacket. Really impressed witht the device's design and utility. Strong OTB fittings on one side and USB on the other. The adapter is clever device to have on my workbench too. I've been using these for a few months now and have no issues to report. I recommend\n",
      "Regular rechargeables work just the same We purchased to use in some baby items where we felt regular rechargeable batteries weren't lasting very long because the devices are used so much. The description stated these Lithium ion batteries would last longer between charges than regular rechargeable batteries but we didn't see that was the case. The design is neat where each battery lights up during charging but you're not gaining any use spending the higher cost in these.\n",
      "Kind of pricey, but great batteries These batteries are great, so far I haven't had any problems with them, I've had them for about a month now, I will continue to use them and after some time passes, I will come back and edit this review to let everyone know how the batteries Fair after extensive use.\n",
      "Awesome! These are great! They recharge by USB, making it so convenient. And they come with a little carrying case too!\n",
      "A fast recharging AAA battery with solid power Got these to use for my headlamp which  I use almost daily and go through tons of alkaline batteries which are really useless when they are half way through the discharge.  These gave me over 2 hrs of bright white light continuous!.  The PaleBlue batteries are easy to recharge and mine did in under an hour.\n",
      "A very powerful AA Lithium Battery with a quick recharge cycle. Looking for a AA battery with a straight line power discharge to end of charge of 4.5 volts and quick recharge time I decided to try these batteries.  They so far have exceeded my expectations. Using them in an acoustic electric guitar pre amplifier I have gotten up to 5 hrs and voltage has only dropped to 4.4 Volts. With power of 2.25 Watt Hours and 1560 mAh along with sustained voltage to to end of charge, they have by far exceeded my expectations over any alkaline I have used. I am buying more as backups and to replace many other alkalines\n",
      "Love these Rechargeable Batteries Love these batteries! We've been trying to move away from traditional batteries and this is exactly what we've been looking for.I like how easy they are to charge (fully charged in a couple hours) and use. The covering is smooth and the product is sleek and super easy to use.These batteries seem to power things brighter than our old batteries too. I love the small charging port (the top twists to keep out dust while using or storing) and the red and green light ring that lets you know if they're charged or not.I definitely plan on buying more of these to phase our old batteries out completely. I highly recommend!!\n",
      "Want to like them. I ordered with high hopes, and first set came with one battery that didn't hold a charge.  The others that did charged rather quickly (about 2 hours) and I used a set in my Xbox One controller.  It lasted about that same time as regular batteries, which is awesome.  Had to send those back, as a replacement was sent to me because of the one defective battery.  I kept the two that I knew worked well, and took two others as a replacement and sent the old ones back. The two original are still working fine (on second charge and still lasting just as long), but I received yet another dud.  This time, the battery seems to charge (I receive a green light indicating full charge), but it conks out after a few minutes. So, at this time, it seems the batteries are unreliable, which is a shame, because when they work, they seem to work really well.  But at this time, it seems to be a gamble whether you get 4 good batteries, or just a couple and a couple of duds. As it is now, I have to send all 4 back for a refund (they won't replace them this time).  I really want to like these batteries.  There are other AA USB charging batteries out there, maybe I'll have better luck with them.\n",
      "Easy Charging Easy charging via any USB-A charger.\n",
      "Strong and well built lithium ion rechargable battery Always looking for stronger rechargable batteries for my tens unit. Typical lithium ion rechargable battery is drained after 3 hours. These batteries last about 5 hours. I've only been using them for a week. Can't wait to see how they hold up over time. Cool package, case, USB charger chord and OTB plug into the side of the battery, which is well built and rigid!\n",
      "cool different but so cool\n",
      "I only got half what I paid for I thought I ordered 4 usb rechargeable AA batteries. I ended up getting two rechargeable, and two blue no name lithium batteries. One of the blue no name batteries was also dead. I don’t know what kind of deal this is. Not what I paid for.\n",
      "Charging time faster than expected Charged up just fine\n",
      "Don't know if these Batts are working right The company stated..... \"ONE HOUR CHARGING TIME - Fully charged in less than 2 hours, more efficient and energy-saving. LED indicator will turn on red when in charge, and turn out after fully charged\" Mine flash blue for about 2 hrs. And then turn solid blue after that. Maybe defective? Ran my scanner for about 6 hrs. But so far I have seen no red light.Later..... I found out 1 of the batteries is defective, guess I'm returning them.\n",
      "Poor quality. Unable to hold charge. Poor quality. Broke on second recharge. First recharge did not last longer. Better to look for quality products from renowned company.\n",
      "14g. The weight is great! My wrist is happier. I got these to lighten my mouse. I also got their AAA...less stress on my hand. My mouse requires 2 AAsSo far so good!\n",
      "Love them These are simoly great, I use them on everything, no issues, just use, recharge, re-use.\n",
      "Purchased many times. Wish they had been around sooner These are one of my favorite things that I’ve bought recently. I wish they were around sooner. They combine the convenience of old-school batteries and the ease of USB charging. Very reliable. Futuristic item. Everyone I show them to loves them. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Trade charge life for recharge ease The batteries do not last as long on a single charge as an alkaline, but they are VERY easily recharged.  Great for my wireless keyboard and mouse.\n",
      "I have reorder more We are pleased with this product and ordered more\n",
      "Great! They work great and charge quickly. Definitely buying more, already bought a 2nd set. Great for remotes and last for a while.\n",
      "Better than I expected -- WAIT! Update! Update:  After leaving review, My right controller went dead a few weeks later. I switched out the batteries, and it still didn't work. I reset my headset, figuring it must be a hardware issue, but discovered that one of the rechargeable batteries does not recharge. So I have one useless battery. However, the rest are fine. I will update again if I have more issues, but I'm dropping my review to three stars... one for each useful battery.I read the reviews, so I've been super careful removing the tops so they do not break. No problems for me at all.  All four batteries came charged. I popped them into my Oculus Quest controllers, and they have gone through three gaming sessions so far without any issues, and no need to change them out yet. I will leave this review five stars, unless I find that they do not recharge after the initial use. Right now, though, I am quite tickled with them.\n",
      "Great These are pretty good. I used them for Xbox controller and last longer than the battery pack. Depends on how much you use them but for me it can last from 4 days to a whole week. But couldnt find more to order, I think there are another brand or color.\n",
      "Rechargeable batteries with UBS plug in the battery is very convenient. I use these batteries in my remotes, pc mice, and a battery operated amplifier.  Very convenient, and definitely beats having to constantly buy batteries.  Recharges quickly.\n",
      "Works well, but understand what you're getting. These are novel and strange batteries. It's super convenient to recharge via USB chargers (which are ubiquitous these days). It'd be nice if they came with a 4-way cable to permit charging all cells off one suitable USB charger. These are excellent when you have a device that's really meant for cells like alkaline or lithium primary cells that put out a full 1.5V. Sometimes such a device won't work as well from 1.2V rechargables like NiMH or NiCad. These cells will work better, but you'll need to be aware of key downsides:1) Because they output a full 1.5V steadily until fully discharged, there's no voltage dip for electronic gadgets to use to gauge battery charge remaining. So your device will appear fully-charged on these batteries 100% till cutout, which will be sudden and unexpected. Have a backup set ready!2) Because of (1), these cells are a little risky when used to power devices like digital recorders and cameras. They'll work, but because of the sudden cut-out when discharged, if you fail to stop your recording in the normal way beforehand, you may lose the /entire/ recording due to failure to write-out and close the recording file to the flash memory normally. For a still camera, this'll be just the last picture at cut-out, but for an audio or video recording, you might lose the whole recording. The risk can be minimized by timing the runtime in the device you get from the cells in a test-run first, then being careful to stop using the device in the field in sufficient time to save and close your recording before that time (being sure to adjust for extreme temperatures, which reduce capacity).3) These batteries work by using a micro-mini voltage convertor to step the cell's native 3.6V (4.2V - 3.0V) down to a fixed 1.5V output. A side effect of the convertor's operation is stray radio-frequency emission, some of which is conducted thru into the device being powered. If that device is a radio receiver, like a handheld scanner or FRS/GMRS handy-talkie, or similar, you can expect reduced receive performance.In testing with a handheld scanner I use to monitor operations at my local airport, I experienced a 50% reduction of sensitivity, and some low frequencies (e.g. the AM broadcast band) were lost in the RF noise from these cells entirely. This isn't a defect, it's just a side-effect of how the cells work. A battery-powered GPS device may also be affected, I tried them in a Garmin GPSmap 60CS 2-AA handheld GPS unit. They worked flawlessly for me here, with no reduction in satellite signal strength, but your device may vary and you could try it out first before going into the field. And again, there will be no warning prior to end-of-discharge cut-off, the GPS will appear \"fully charged\" the entire time.So what do I use them for? I have an LED flashlight that's super bright, but was designed for alkaline cells and would not get to full brightness on normal NiMH rechargeables. These cells work _perfectly_ there. The only remaining downside is limited cell capacity. From 2400 mAh NiMH cells, I'd get two hours continuous runtime, but these cells can only provide one hour (1200 mAh capacity). Again, that's simply a side effect of the design and isn't a defect.I also have a couple of fancy electronic flash units for my SLR camera, and these cells work extremely well in that device too!So, know your device and your application to decide if these cells are right for you. Most modern electronic gadgets like radio equipment or digital recording devices will be designed to operate just fine from 1.2V NiMH cells, and these won't harm the receive performance of a radio like these USB cells. Plus, you'll get proper charge-state indications from NiMH cells. Just remember to select and pack a quality NiMH charger in that case.\n",
      "Great product Still using\n",
      "Awsome!! What can I saw, these batteries are awesome. USB rechargeable, and eliminated the need to buy and waste batteries for a while! Physically these are a tad longer than regular batteries, about 1mm. But they will still fit in all your electronic devices.Highly recommend as a green alternative\n",
      "Very good deal Arrived in a timely manner. The batteries were easy to use and the charge lasted in about 2 weeks in my switch controller.\n",
      "Easy to use Relative to other existing old and contemporary batteries these USB batteries HIGTRENDS are durable and built to withhold much.  They are easy to charge via outlets or whatever comes its way.  Fully USB compatible batteries that work for hundreds and hundreds usages.Highly recommendable!\n",
      "Great Buy! Easy setup.\n",
      "Work Great work great and hold a charge for a long time.\n",
      "The battries was amazing i tried it once Good batteries and I will order more again\n",
      "Good to go So far I’m using in my wireless mouse and a remote. So far it’s held a charge and they are just as responsive as reg batteries\n",
      "Love them! The one and ONLY downside I have found with these batteries is that you get no directions, but it is extremely easy to figure out.  They light up when they are charging.  The AA blink until fully charged and then have a solid blue light near the Positive end.  The AAA batteries blink until they are full charged, which at that time the light shuts off.  The shipping was quick and adequate.  I'm using the AAA for my wireless keyboard and mouse.  I'm very glad not to have to buy any more batteries for a long time to come.  The AA batteries I'm fix'n to put into one of my TV remotes.  Can't say enough good things about this product.\n",
      "These are complete junk. I purchased the AA batteries.  They do not come with instructions.  What is written on amazon is what you get.  They do not have a red light to indicate charging.  Mine flashes blue.  When they are charged they turn to solid blue.  After the second charge I had thought the batteries stopped working.  It turns out the pin in the cap was slightly bent and was not making the correct connection with the bottom part in one of the batteries.  I bent it back to match the other batteries and everything seems fine for the time being.\n",
      "Dangerous for people who dont read instructions Turns out when it sats input of 500 ma, it means it.Grabbed the closest USB charger on hand to get these puppies warmed up.  About 5 minutes later I hear a pop and hiss.  The light is off, and there's an odd smell.  The labels seems to have heated up and shrunk.Take it off the charger, the adhesive has melted!  Now I have an open battery thats spewed what looks like electrolyte on my wall charger.Long story short, do not plug these into a 2A USB charger.  Keep it low and slow.\n",
      "works great but... works great but be gentle.  they are not the strongest built.  works great and last a long time in my xbox controller\n",
      "Very good purchase you will not be disappointed I love the Beast batteries can be charged up if using an external charger standard Android charger cord and they last about as long as a regular AA battery. Just be careful that you don't lift the cap up too high or flick it back too hard because it is on a little bungee and you don't want to break it or lose the cap\n",
      "WORKS GOOD FOR MAGLITE The 4 pack is awesome, for testing purposes though, I have only been using the same 2 batteries in my mini maglite for almost 2 years (the other 2 are used randomly in the house) and have charged them over 50 times. When using the flashlight a lot I can get two weeks from a charge and have they sat unused for months and still had adequate charge left. The charge doesn't last as long as alkaline but, on the other hand, I haven't bought batteries for my light in two years. It takes about 4 hours to charge from completely dead.  They make the flashlight as bright as a \"fresh out the pack\" pair of alkaline batteries and they stay that bright. They don't dim the flashlight as they discharge like the alkaline do. The flashlight stays at peak brightness until the batteries are fully discharged and the light goes completely out. I keep a pair of alkaline batteries in my toolbox at work for when the light dies and I'm needing to use the light and cant wait for them to charge. When the batteries are done charging they go back in the light and the alkaline go back in the toolbox.\n",
      "The batteries that will make you never buy disposable batteries ever again. The fact these even exist in the first place is a godsend. They charge via any USB port in about an 90 minutes and will work in your every day electronics. Is perfect for game controllers that still use AA batteries, TV remotes, wireless mouse and keyboards (which is what I got them for) and many other devices.If there is one thing I will say is a small concern is the cap on top that covers the USB port. It's held on by a small elastic cord to prevent it from being misplaced. I would be very careful when removing and replacing, as it feels it can snap off if moved too fast, so just be careful.Other than that, my only other complaint is........why did I not get these sooner? They are 100% worth the money. I plan to get some more of these and some AAA versions soon.\n",
      "1 out of 4 won't charge Will be sent back. One out of four will not charge, therefore cannot use. Apparently no testing done.\n",
      "Solid Easy to charge, have kept their charge for quite some time, look forward to continuing to use them around the house. Would recommend.\n",
      "They do what they claim to do Been using these for 6 months in my game controllers. I've only had to recharge them once so far.Because of the elastic band holding the cap on, it can be a little finicky to get them properly charging in the USB port, but since they illuminate when charging that's not much of an issue.The biggest downside that you might overlook is that any device you put these into can't know the charge level. So my wireless controllers won't warn me when they're low on battery anymore -- they just go from working well to flaking out when the batteries are low without much warning. Presumably this is because the voltage of these batteries as they discharge doesn't follow that of a typical alkaline battery (instead, the voltage is mostly constant throughout the discharge because of the circuitry that converts the 3.7 V of the lithium battery to the 1.5 V presented at the AA terminals, until it just completely drops out).\n",
      "Good They light up when charging to tell you when it's done and they look nice\n",
      "Really handy rechargeables I really hate having to lug a charger around in order to use rechargeable batteries!  These were the solution to my desire for easy to use rechargeables.  They work great, charge quickly, and are almost as long lasting as the best ones I've every used.  The hidden USB plug makes them just too easy to recharge.\n",
      "Good for low power products Been using this for my gaming mouse which uses 2 batteries at a time and they usually last about 6-8 weeks before I have to switch them out. That's perfectly acceptable for how much the mouse gets used.  With regular batteries, it would last about 5 to 6 months so you get your money back and then some within the year. I'm sure wit degradation I will have to switch them out more frequently but that has yet to be determined.\n",
      "Very neat and nice product! Can’t really confirm durability yet, but all seems good so far! Arrived in beautiful reusable container and provide very good life in my daily used flashlight!\n",
      "I wouldn’t buy again It’s okay in a pinch. It needs to be recharged too often.\n",
      "So useful ! These batteries are the best !!No more disposable leaking AA's.Charge quickly and have a good capacity.\n",
      "Looking forward for a charger port They are very good for life\n",
      "They are rechargeable without a special charger that's pretty awesome. They fit correct, they work in my blink cameras.  Win win\n",
      "USB AA !!!!!! WOW!!!!! The AA batteries are a brilliant idea. A perfect easy way to quickly recharge the battery in a USB plug.\n",
      "I love these batteries These are great, and you can reuse them for a long time, just recharge them.  These have replaced all of my disposable batteries. I highly recommend these.\n",
      "lasts long good batts but you have to be careful when you take them out that you dont pull the top off.....\n",
      "Wonderful product I'd recommend these to everyone!! I love them so much. Such a good gift to give to someone who has everything!\n",
      "Works great Work great, using daily for over a year.\n",
      "USB charging Hi - i purchased these for my some to use in his gaming controller and the can be plugged into his computer or another charger.  The only issue is you have to open the lid and the lid is hanging so you have to use several diffrent outlets to charge bc it takes up some space\n",
      "Great! The package was nice, came with a octopus cable to charge the batteries. The only thing is that 1 of the batteries did not work. It came damaged. I will be returning just to get them replaced. Other than that I would recommend.\n",
      "Work great I use those for my waterpik. It's awesome almost like it's more powerful\n",
      "Excellent Product Great for the money. Excellent source for hurricanes. Easy to charge. Buying another 24 to have ready for hurricane season.\n",
      "They don’t last. I used these twice and the last time they did not hold a charge. Don’t waste your money.  Sent back for a refund.\n",
      "Worth the change. I haven't used them yet tho I opened the package and it seems like good quality so that's why I gave 3 stars.\n",
      "Great potential! With these batteries, I can save myself from buying many more regular ones.  I can't say how many cycles I will get from them as I just got them.  They seem a little pricey,  but they are lithium, so they will last longer than regular alkaline batteries.  Overall, these batteries seem to be a great deal!\n",
      "Charging Very easy to charge. Charged voltage level(equal) very good on most of them. Longevity is an unknown at this point.\n",
      "GREAT BATTERY'S i HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL PACKS OF THESE BATTERIES AND VERY PLEASED WITH THEM...\n",
      "Finicky, get a better brand. I really Tried to love these batteries but this specific brand exhibited issues with charging and longevity of operation.  First of all, they were very finicky with regard to charging.  It was like they had to be held at a specific angle in the USB port to receive a charge.Longevity wise, they give little or no warning prior to losing all charge.  I understand This is normal for lithium batteries but was disappointed in how quickly they went from output to zero output.Next time I’ll buy a different brand.\n",
      "Unique way to recharge a battery! Just plug into a USB charging port. Really neat.\n",
      "Good to have around I charged them up but havent used them yet. They are pretty cool\n",
      "Lower energy density than most other Lithium-ion AA batteries These batteries only have 1200 mWh while others are around 3000 mWh .  They are easier to charge but I would not want to give up so much energy for that ease of charging.\n",
      "Possibly might not want to use for a gaming controller I bought these to use in xbox controllers. They last a good amount of time. My only issue is that I do not get a warning that the batteries are low. The controller just dies.\n",
      "Some batteries now blinking blue when plugged in to recharge after a single charge! I've been replacing all my batteries in my house with these rechargeable ones.  I purchased them in December and already I have 3 of the blue tipped double A's blinking blue when trying to recharge.  They are usually light up RED when charging.  So I'm waiting for the vendor or someone to tell me what the Blinking Blue means.  I'm assuming it means the battery is bad.  If that is the case then I've only charged them once, put them in my tv remotes and now 3  are shot.  Not good quality control if thats the case.  The vendor says a 12 month warranty and I'm within the period, but still, kills the idea of moving forward with purchasing more.  This is the reason for the single star review!\n",
      "USB not really that practical The fact that each battery has to take a whole USB port is actually not as useful as you’d think. After using them I prefer the ones that charge via cable (you can charge 4 at a time from one plug)\n",
      "Convenient and long lasting I had purchased a large pack of regular lithium batteries for my Blink cameras and Kwikset Smart Locks, so I would have extras on hand. The batteries last so much longer than standard batteries, so I decided to look into rechargeable lithium batteries.I bought this 4-pack a a test. I like that you just pop the cap off and stick them in a USB to charge. It takes about 90 minutes to fully charge the batteries. The red light is on during charge and off when done. No looking around for the charging equipment either, which is incredibly convenient.I put these batteries into a new Kwikset Smart Lock I had just installed. I replaced the batteries in another Kwikset Smart Lock elsewhere in the house, so I could compare the rechargeable vs standard lithium. The other lock is used much more often and the batteries in it are still going strong after I just had to charge these batteries. Time was about 3.5 months. Considering I could recharge them and replace them at no additional cost, AND that they still lasted 3.5 months in the lock was impressive enough that I plan to buy more.Next, I would like to test them in my Blink cameras to see how they fare. I will update this review once I have done so.\n",
      "Problematic,  daily charging. Update:  I was sent a replacement,  garbage too, these aren't worth $5.50  each, wasted money.  I'm charging on a daily basis,  these are problematic and I have no idea why,  these look like regular batteries but my camera won't respond at times,  flicking, stops working,  Don't buy these pass on to another brand.\n",
      "Perfect for the Oculus Rift S controllers These work great in the controllers of my Oculus Rift S. When they need a charge the cap just lifts off so I can plug in the USB. I love that the caps are attached by a band so I don't have to worry about losing them and rendering them unusable.\n",
      "No Good. After charging them I put them into a outdoor camera and they did not work.\n",
      "Excellent Is very easy to use\n",
      "nice batteries easy and convenient.  so far so good at keeping a quality charge.\n",
      "Better than advertised Great\n",
      "Your moneys worth I use these for my wireless cameras that get alot of motions they last longer than regular ones\n",
      "does not last long I had to keep recharging these almost daily so sent them back.\n",
      "Great Product I use these batteries for my camera, I would spend so much alone on just batteries. These are good and they're rechargeable. I'd take the chance on spending $20 just to see how these batteries hold up.\n",
      "USB batteries They charged they worked.\n",
      "These batteries can be charged at home or in the car any place that has a USB port. I like these batteries because they are a true 1.5+ volt.\n",
      "Great rechargeable battery! No need for a battery charger, you can just plug it into your laptop, computer, or wall charger to charge them. They do not have as much capacity as a normal rechargeable battery (which is less than a normal battery) but it is TERRIFIC for wireless mice and other low-draw devices. They also weigh less than normal batteries, meaning that they are great for devices that you would think would be better if they were lighter (again mice/gaming peripherals). I bought these for my Logitech G604 and have only switched out the battery once in 6 months of never turning off the mouse or switching it over to Bluetooth, i.e. worst-case scenario for the mouse.\n",
      "Great batteries! Gave this a test and to my surprise they work well.  I use them in clocks, computer mouse and a few other devices.  Recharge is easy as u can plug them into any USB outlet or any device with USB hookups.  Great if u wanna save money and stop polutting with regular batteries that eventually die and get thrown away.\n",
      "Poor quality for price. They do not stay charge for a long period of time.\n",
      "Not Meant for All Electronics :/ I purchased this item and the associated charger because I am burning through batteries with my gen 1 Blink Camera devices and thought a rechargeable was the way to go. However, I have noticed, and since reached out to Blink, that I have lost functionality for the cameras. (I am told it is because these rechargeables are not recognized, nor is there any plan moving forward to support rechargeables:(My motion sensor is all but useless, the live feed is slow to load and takes multiple attempts, and then it continues to fail to register that a fresh set of charged batteries are in the device.While this is not a direct reflection on the batteries themselves, it was an investment to purchase both the batteries and charger that I am now left to find other uses for since that are contraindicated for the original intended devices. Please consider this before making my mistake!\n",
      "No more huge pile of used batteries The Wii remotes use AA batteries and it was getting expensive keeping them supplied. We used to use a rechargeable Ni-MH battery pack made especially for the Wii that required a special charger until we found these USB rechargeable Li-ion batteries. Our set we ordered last year is still going strong so we ordered more. These batteries are good products and easy to recharge in our USB outlets without having to bother hunting down a cable. Just pull off the cap and plug it in.\n",
      "Charge doesn’t last I bought these for in my wireless backup camera.  They didn’t last more than a few hours.  I put Duracell batteries in and it works fine.\n",

      "Thanks It’s a good batteries and not using for few hours then recharge it, it’s taking days to recharge it again\n",
      "A definite must have for your battery collection. I love these rechargeable batteries. They are so easy to use. No more having to deal with Having to find the case to put them in and then plug them into the wall.. just pop them out of  whatever device you're using and plug them right into the nearest USB... And you know, they're charged when the light on the battery goes from red to blue. ... Super simple... I have bought several sets of these batteries. I absolutely love them.... I wish they made them in all sizes of batteries. I would buy every single size.\n",
      "Good Good\n",
      "This was an interesting purchase We go  through batteries like crazy around our house.  Although we've had a several times tried re-chargeable. they just need recharging to often.  So we usually resort to AA and AAA lithium batteries from the major brands.  When I saw these advertised I thought how clever, a AA rechargeable Li-ion battery with a USB plug at one end for charging!  They actual charge well, although a little slowly(probably a built-in safety feature).  They also don't have the high capacity that I was used to  back in the NiMH days.  They are only rated at 1200mAh.\n",
      "AA battery Pretty darn good value\n",
      "Happy purchase Success at last!  They work perfectly with the Blink camera.\n",
      "Great for the value Seems to be as advertised though too early to tell about longevity.  Will buy again.\n",
      "Love rechargeable batteries, the fact these work in Lithium devices is a huge bonus :-) Works great bought for Blink cameras and so far so good!\n",
      "Took me 12 hrs to figure out opening their plastic case! I need to plug myself in to charge~! I got these yesterday and  the instructions were in a foreign language, not that it would help as I am sure it did not show how to open the God forsaken plastic casing they were enclosed in. Now I guess I will need to plug them and charge them? Who knows, 1 broken nail and bruised fingers...\n",
      "Worth the money I put in to get it Friend recommended them to me. Haven’t had any issues or problems with them. Mainly use them for my Xbox controller and trimmer. Battery life amazing.\n",
      "Worked perfectly! Convenient and working fine so far...just a few weeks since purchase.\n",
      "It was the ONLY rechargeable lithium battery we could find available I like that they are rechargeable lithium batteries. The longevity is good considering how much they’re used. I use them for my wireless security cameras.\n",
      "Great bye. Saves you money.\n",
      "Bang for your buck Been using them for a few weeks now and they work great charge fast and last pretty long mainly been using in my Xbox controller only reason there 4 instead of 5 is because there is no low battery warning it just dies abruptly without warning so not good for competitive play but for normal functionality would not be a problem definitely saved me money in buying batteries\n",
      "Learn about LiPO batteries they can be dangerous I purchased you because they were a little cheaper they have a different type charging Jack I recommend spending a little more money and getting the ones with the phone jack already had one of these tops break off\n",
      "Value I got these for my Xbox remote control to try them and they work great, they charge super fast and last about the same time as a regular AA. I will be ordering more for my camera soon.\n",
      "Too Soon Since I just charged the batteries for the first time, I cannot address longivity and value for the money; and the batteries do not have a remote control.\n",
      "Tired of the cost of batteries??? Use these batteries in my Keypad for my alarm system.  Regular batteries last about 2 days on average.  The only drawback is you have to take the time to recharge.  In my case I use 4 at a time, so charging does take time before the keypad is up and running again.  About an hour for each battery.  The blue light will inform you when the battery is fully charged and ready for use.  Great value for the money as of this review.\n",
      "Convenient rechargeable batteries Chargeable everywhere which is way more convenient then standard rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "USB AA batteries are worth every penny These batteries are easy to charge and hold the charge. Look at how many times you have to buy batteries,  these will save you a bundle.\n",
      "Exactly what I needed for my mouse! Ever find yourself needing a AA battery but not have one? I can never tell when my mouse battery will die. When it did, I was lucky enough to have a coworker lend me one of these batteries.  Score! I was back to being productive. I immediately purchased a pack for myself and my husband. One in each of our laptop bags. No cons found so far!\n",
      "Long lasting def worth the money My son wanted them for his controller. For an avid gamer whose 15 playing his friends in our old neighborhood without interruption-priceless!\n",
      "Not working Battery doesn’t even hold charge for a single day.. I bought this battery after reading comments and reviews but not worth it\n",
      "A must have!! A must have if you use AAs. I have 16 of these and they’re awesome! They take about 2 hours to charge and last as long as a decent AA... remotes, led lights... a good buy and money saver!!\n",
      "As fragile as an egg shell I purchased a couple sets of these as an alternative to purpose-built rechargeable battery packs for Xbox One controllers. While I was initially pleased with the purchase, that pleasure unraveled in short order.The Good:The little rechargeable batteries feature a nifty \"flip cap\" design, exposing a standard-issue USB-A male connector (think: the tried and true USB connection type for desktop computers and wall chargers). They charge relatively quickly, and fit perfectly well in anything that accepts AA batteries.The Bad:TL;DR: they break. Very. Easily. The USB connector (not the battery top-style cap) breaks with very little provocation. On top of that, the actual innards of the lithium battery also come out of the metallic \"battery\" housing without much effort as well (say, when removing the battery from the port in which it's charging). Out of eight batteries (two 4-packs), only about three remain intact at the time of this review. While I admittedly did not got out of my way to be extra gentle (and, to be fair, I didn't see the need to be), I also did not physically punish these items to the extent that their current condition would suggest. I've handled plenty of similar-sized USB devices from thumb drives, to Bluetooth/WiFi and more, and have not experienced this level of degradation before.Conclusion:I believe this product to be a case of good idea/poor implementation. The convenience of having AA shaped/sized rechargeable batteries which do not require a specialized charger is delightful, but the elation there only lasts as long as these batteries (read: not long at all). I have since broken down and purchased charging stands with battery packs for my controllers, and that seems to be working out a good deal better. I wanted to like these little guys (and actually did, in the beginning), but I can't allow myself to love a product with throwaway build quality. Buyer beware.\n",
      "Flip-Top Battery? Superman would approve! Work travel!? These batteries are perfect for business related needs! Cannot imagine better way to charge a battery than to flip the top open and utilize a USB port for charging!Holy Guacamolé Star of Excellence!\n",
      "Made my TENS rechargeable! These are fantastic! I bought them for my TENS unit. Unfortunately they aren’t strong enough for more than one go with it so I am recharging them a lot but that might be because the TENS used so much energy. I also love that I can charge them with a USB charger.\n",
      "Powerfull Rechargable Have not had to recharge yet. Using two in a remote and two in an electric toothbrush, which seems to have more power than with regular batteries. Easy usb recharge.\n",
      "Hard to open Can't even open the package\n",
      "They work as advertised I bought these to use in my blink xt cameras and they work fine...I like the convenience of being able to keep multiple sets of these charged up to replace those that run out of power.. be aware that these are roughly 1/2 the stored energy of regular lithium ion batteries and that means they won't last as long.. I believe these are in the 1250 maH range so keep that in mind..they work fine despite their lower stored energy rating..\n",
      "great value. reliable. great batteries. charge easily. takes up a bit of soace at charging socket.\n",
      "Short Battery life I use these in an aviation noise cancelling headset and they only last about 1/2 the time of regular name brand batteries.  It's handy to be able to charge them anywhere, but maybe go with higher quality rechargables that last a little longer.\n",
      "Excellent Great batteries.i bought them for my hako soldering iron it lasts longer and seems hotter than standard battries.and cheaper if you solder alot.\n",
      "Awesome Batteries! Great product. Would highly recommend these.\n",
      "Finally, a good rechargable battery. I use these for an outdoor temp sensor for my heating system.  These work great, down to 20 below 0 F so far.\n",
      "great value i got these 1.5v AA USB rechargeable batteries to replace my old pair of USB rechargeable batteries.so far these batteries work better than my old USB rechargeable batteries. my last pair of USB rechargeable batteries lasted 10+ years. so, i can only hope that these new ones will last just as long since USB rechargeable batteries have greatly improved since then.1200mAH is also a great improvement over the older 600mAH AA USB rechargeable batteries\n",
      "They don't last long I tested these against Amazon Basic rechargeables and they only last 50% as long between charges in the same fixture.. I will not be ordering more of these. Too expensive.\n",
      "No good I recharged them once and they are dead ,they take quite a long time to charge so I assumed they would work again and they didnt i paid a fortune for 4 AA disposable batteries\n",
      "Is very good I will use them for remote control and electronic toys\n",
      "Excellent, versatile power solution I use these batteries for multiple purposes. For portable use, I find the ability to charge them at any location, using standard usb chargers, to be very useful. I recommend these to friends and family on a regular basis.\n",
      "These are great little batteries. I like the usb recharging. They take a long time to recharge. But, they take a long time to discharge. They scare me a little, but so far so good.\n",
      "Charge fast and saves money I love my rechargeable batteries! Before I would have to replace my batteries every week or two. Now I can simply recharge these and reuse my batteries. They charge pretty fast too so that’s a plus. I love that I’m saving money and limiting my waste too!\n",
      "Practicas Práctica para cargar en cualquier puerto USB\n",
      "Great buy! Batteries charge up quickly and last quite a long time. They actually surpassed my expectations. Also, very prompt delivery and packaged very well with lots of protection. I will definitely buy these again from this company!\n",
      "Rechargeable and is able to take the cold weather I have a temperature thermometer that has a separate controller that goes outside to tell you the outside temperature and they recommend the lithium batteries for cold weather and so far it’s been working really well rather than the alkaline\n",
      "Poor Did not work. Lasted 18 hrs with my outdoor camera.\n",
      "Games counsel battery replacement that are way better Great price... beat batteries for Xbox controllers.  Last longer then rechargeable Xbox batteries plus a you get 4 for half the price!!\n",
      "Interesting Christmas present for my active son in law\n",
      "Great concept nice implementation. Absolutely love these. The time to a full charge is a little bit longer than what it says on the site...(I'm seeing approximately 2 hours from a near dead charge to full but that's fine.  I use these for in wireless IEM's and they work great.  The ONLY drawback, (that I admit I have not experienced yet but I anticipate a failure) is the stretchy string that holds the cap on -  i see it failing, and i also see really no way to replace it, which means at some point I will likely lose the cap rendering this useless.  Nevertheless, 1500 charges before failure, I figure I will save close to $1200 over the life of the batteries.\n",
      "The little gems work great I use these batteries in my computer mouse, keeping a spare set plugged in that are always charged when a change is needed.  Love that I'm helping my wallet and the planet by using rechargeables.  They arrive in a nifty little case.\n",
      "Work great Work great\n",
      "batteries worked, thanks batteries worked, thanks\n",
      "New Great idea\n",
      "Fast charge and last long Recharge fast and last long\n",
      "Never buy alkalines again Bought these for my Oculus Rift controllers. They work like a dream and last longer than traditional batteries. Only issue is with battery level indication. Haven't had something else to try these with, but they appear to always read as fully charged to my controls even as they die. Might be a Rift problem. Great choice either way as they function and don't need a special charging dock.\n",
      "Do not last long for extended continuous use. These are a fantastic idea. I love them however I wish they lasted a little longer. I bought them to go in a battery operated under the cabinet light strip. They only last a couple hours before I have to charge again. definitely not something you could leave on all night. I would recommend these for short use items such as flashlights. I do like that they are super easy to recharge and I like that the caps stay attached by an elastic cord when charging. I will just have to find another use for them.Edit: after having these for a while I dont even really use them anymore. They would be good for a low power device maybe. I only have 1 device I really use batteries for right now and its annoying to take them out and charge every other day.\n",

      "No english Why is there nothing in English?  The directions Are written in Chinese!!!!\n",
      "Good product This is by far one of my best buys. I do not need to buy more batteries and these last a long time\n",
      "These suck Bought for my Amazon Blink Camera and they lasted about 6 days in the camera.  One of the other two doesn't charge.  Don't buy\n",
      "Oculus Quest approved and then some! I purchased these for my Oculus Quest controllers, and at this point, I'm convinced they should just be purchased for anything. Unlike most rechargeable batteries, these give off a full 1.5v (instead of 1.2v which many other rechargeables do) and the fact I do not need another charger (it's built into the battery) just make these the best rechargeables I've owned so far. As far as battery life goes, they surpass the Quest's own battery life even after heavy Beat Saber sessions (and yes, putting sabers into the fields so the drain is even harder).They may be pricy at $20 for 4, but if you hate swapping batteries and keep losing the chargers, pair these up with a USB multi-charger and you have a match made in heaven. Also, the battery case included is pretty nice as well and most hotels I've seen now have USB chargers in the room, so what isn't to love about these things?\n",
      "Good Good\n",
      "Absolute Junk These are complete junk. They aren't even the voltage they say they are. When you slide the casing off, you see the actual amount. 2 of the 4 fried and came apart within days of use.\n",
      "* Evrything\n",
      "Easy to charge with usb. I use these batteries in a digital camera and they are working fine.This is a very good seller to work with also.\n",
      "Works as expected I charged and put them into my keyboard and mouse. No issues so far.The cap has a strap so it won't be lost while charging.\n",
      "Convenient, works They work as described, very pleased\n",
      "Reliable Batteries Worked out well\n",
      "No more battery replacements These batteries are the future. Never need to buy lead acid again\n",
      "Don't waste your money on this worthless Chicom\"  crap! 1 battery \"DOA\" won't charge. Of course I discovered this after the return time expired...\n",
      "These work very well for me These are so far very good indeed. We are using them for Sennheiser EW100 wireless body pack microphones, which are medium to high-drain devices, and have done so for a few months now. They easily last for 6 hours on a charge. Indeed, after 6 hours of use, the battery indicators on the transmitters still show *full.*  They are already saving us on disposable AA alkaline cells.These don't fit in adjacent ports in a typical USB charger, but that's a charger problem. We can always get little USB Male to Female pigtails, but I just use additional chargers. Problem solved.Also, I plugged just two them into my desktop computer to charge, and they took away power from other connected USB devices. So you might need to use a dedicated charger, or perhaps only charge one at a time with your computer.From reading some of the reviews, I'm thinking that these might not be good for low-drain / low-use applications such as digital clocks, remote controls or doorbells. So your mileage may vary.\n",
      "They die quickly and instantly. Die very quickly, and unlike other batteries they do not slowly discharge: they die instantly. Neat option to have on hand, however.\n",
      "GREAT They are great and last longer than regular batteries\n",
      "SERIOUSLY BUY THESE NOW Preface: eveyone better be jumpin' on the rechargeable train. It is absolutely the only viable future.1. Less waste than regular batteries (and yeah we all know we aren't supposed to throw batteries away with our regular trash, yeah? But who actually knows where to take them? And who is actually disposing of them properly?)2. Safer. No chance of leaky, corrosive chemicals.3. Cheaper. Yes the up front cost is more, but they pay for themselves.4. Long lasting life. I have them in my toothbrush, something I use 2x every day at least, and these batteries last 1.5-2 months.5. Quick charge. They take maybe an hour to fully charge!6. Convenience. Even if you have self-centered interests, these are still for you. You don't have to remember to buy more batteries. Like ever. Never again.All in all, these batteries are must-haves and worth the initial investment.\n",
      "Dont work Admit that I did not use them for a while but they were supposed to be used for emergencies like hurricane blackouts. Well I plugged in two and only one charged.  Very disappointing.\n",
      "VERY EASY TO RECHARGE WITH NOTIFICATION INDICATOR Great replacement for high usage electronic test equipment!\n",
      "Works in my Oculus Touch controllers So far so good!\n",
      "Reliable and cost-effective This batteries have served my Garmin and wallet well.  I had to buy another set, because I left two in my pants pockets during a wash cycle. My only grip would be the overly sturdy sealed plastic container they come in. I can’t find a way of opening it without using a sharp implement.\n",
      "So far so good I havent used them just. I did charge  them and appear  fine.. They arrived to my mailing  address  quickly\n",
      "Works Great! I use mine in Blink cameras.  So far I have had a pair in a camera for the past 6 months and they are still going strong.  This camera goes through a pair of regular lithium batters every 10 months.  I will definitely be purchasing more.\n",
      "Good so far Havent have the chance to use them too much but they seem to work well\n",
      "Let’s see Just got them. Only thing I’ve done is charge them. No directions so I’m assuming when the red light goes out they are charged? Now we’ll see how long they last.\n",
      "Rechargeable batteries! Who knew there were USB rechargeable AA batteries?!\n",
      "Bought 4 pack of AA (blue batteries) and they don't work Tried to charge them but not a single one ever fully charged even when left plugged in and charging for over 4 hours. The red light never goes off. I tried to use them anyway since they were charging for hours but they couldn't power anything I tried to use them with. Totally useless.\n",
      "Works but not a fan of the removable end caps. These are solid lithium batteries that work as expected for high demand devices.The only real downside is the removable end caps elastic connectors feel rather flimsy, and I have doubts how long they'll last before breaking. (Hence the 3 star rating.)They're good, but honestly I'd say you're better off going with different models with micro charging ports rather than removable top caps.\n",
      "Poor Battery Life Great in theory but they don’t hold a charge for very long. They only last a month in my blink camera when a standard lithium AA lasted nearly two years.\n",
      "Would Buy Again These batteries are really useful if you go through regular ones really fast. They charge a bit slower than I'd like, but not needing a seperate charger for them makes up for that.\n",
      "Not as good as I had hoped. I was expecting a longer lasting battery. These last about 1/2 to 3/4 as long as a basic cheap AA battery. They last about 2-3 hours in a XBox one controller. One battery hasn't charged properly after the initial charge, but the other 3 seem fine. I now use these in a AA mini Maglite and they do fine for that purpose, but for heavy use I would stay with non-rechargeable lithium-ion or standard alkaline batteries. If being rechargeable is a requirement stick with a quality Ni-MH battery.\n",
      "love it so far so good\n",
      "Finnally a good battery Good\n",
      "Useful--! With USB ports almost ubiquitous, these batteries can be readily recharged.\n",
      "Blink XT Camera's  - Work as well as Lithium disposables Using in my Blink XT and 2Xt cams. First few charges they are lasting a bit longer than stock Energizer Lithium AAs, (4-5Wks originally to ~6-7Wks now with these rechargeable's)  So not  good solution for reducing battery change interval for high traffic area cameras, but overall a $ savings in the long run for cam's you can not easily run a USB power cable to.\n",
      "Works good so far but I'm worried about losing the caps on the AA batteries. On the AAA batteries you plug a supplied micro USB into the side but on the AA batteries you have to take off a cap to reveal the USB charging connector. The cap is attached to the battery by a flimsy thin bungee chord that may not stay attached very long because of the wear-and-tear on the chord every time the battery is charged. The cap is also the positive (+) battery connector so if the chord breaks you'll probably lose the cap soon thereafter and then the battery won't work in any device. And yes, you HAVE to take the caps off to charge the batteries via USB even if the device you're using them in can charge rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "Excellent product and product idea Very good product. Reasonable price\n",
      "A good replacement These batteries are pretty good, the only thing is it's a little expensive for 4 batteries, but then again you don't have to buy more batteries for a long time.\n",
      "Works well in my Blink camera I decided to try them in one of my Blink cameras instead of the disposable Lithium batteries they recommend.  Been over a month now and been working great.  Not sure if they will last as long as the disposable ones before I need to recharge them but seems like a great replacement so far.\n",
      "Great batteries! This is the third pack I've ordered. Have had the previous two packs for nearly a year now and still no sign of significant power loss. They truly take the place of ordinary batteries. Not had any issues with failing to power things like most rechargables.\n",
      "Great for small electronics Keeps from having to keep buying batteries.\n",
      "Excellent design idea, functions great so far so good So far so good. Match to the 4x USB WALL CHARGER for a great battery system.

Also, lots of 2,4,6,8 full-capacity 3v Li-ion batteries that include dummy batteries to allow voltage-matched configurations\n",

      "Won't have to purchase traditional batteries for years. Ultra powerful, fully recharges in just a couple of hours, and has long battery life before needing a recharge.\n",
      "This is a great product. After purchasing the batteries I found them be very good.  The batteries charged with the internal usb hub.\n",
      "Would purchase again A++++\n",
      "Excellent Charging feature These batteries have proven to be of high quality and are a great value over one use disposable batteries.\n",
      "Going Great So Far I have been using these for a good bit now on my Oculus controllers and have had no problem. They last a long time even with Oculus controllers using a lot of power. Really convenient.\n",
      "Just arrived and do not work; will not charge These did not work. I tried to charge them when I first got them, but they will not take a charge. The red light comes on, then goes off again a few seconds later. I have tried using them to power several different items, from my camera to a travel size sweater shaver. Nothing works with these batteries. I’ve tried leaving them on the charger, I have tried different chargers, I have tried the USB slots on my computer. Nothing works—they will not take a charge.\n",

      "Product is suspect at 3 of 4 working after 4 recharges... on my small sampling of 4 Right approach for 1.5v uses, however after 1 year and 4 recharges one battery is completely dead-20 millivolts. Other 3 are still 1.5v.  However it’s hard to estimate life when one is going bad.  The first use lasted long as I expected. The next two 1 month, then 2 weeks... I have contacted seller so an update on their review depends on their response.  I would not repurchase 3 for the price I paid and need to re-evaluate their performance... meaning longevity in milliamp hours.  Upon reflection, not incorporating micro usb they could probably increase capacity by 1/3 using that space with battery... but it does make recharging easy if you have a 1200 milliamp hour battery need.\n",
      "Great Bought to power blink xt cameras... so far after 1 month everything works well.. they wont last forever but for 20 bucks and i get a year out of it is better than 13 bucks every month\n",

      "Expensive, but will save you money in the long run I was tired of running out of batteries for my wireless mouse. Having these around kept me from pulling batteries out of clocks and other devices. 2 in the mouse, and the other two charging works for me and I've run them down enough times to honestly say I've saved money, and they're still going strong. Just got to make sure you don't lose them\n",
      "Extremely convenient Very good power density. Recharge quickly from any USB port. Much less internal leakage than comparable NiMH rechargable batteries so they hold their charge in storage for an extended lenghts of time. The cap is captive so it can't get lost.  I bought inexpensive inserts to put these in for my devices that take expensive and sometimes hard to find \"C\" size batteries.\n",
      "Convenient USB charging, worse value than NiMH I like testing and tinkering around with new battery technologies. These are lithium batteries that don't have the charging problems like the NiMH such as memory effect. However, 1200mah is not a good deal compared to other batteries. I wouldn't try charging these any other way than the USB. You can get NiMH with 2300mah.\n",
      "Easy to charge, works well Very convenient, good performance, good value for the money.\n",
      "size is an issue i don't have them but based  on the pic they are smaller than the regular batteries so logic would say you get half the life span of a regular size battery\n",

I’m currently using a Logitech G602 wireless gaming mouse and I weighted out with rechargeable Energizer the total weight was 134g it pretty heavy for a gaming mouse, so After I put this battery on my mouse feeling much lighter (scaled it come out to 120g) 14g definitely feel a lot different especially for gaming. Definitely recommend this battery for wireless mouse gamer. 👍👍👍👍👍\n",
      "Easy to recharge and use I like not having to purchase an addition device to charge. So far it has worked great in my Blink cameras\n",
      "Are they really Lithium Ion? Nowhere on the batteries or the box does it say anything about lithium ion.  The Amazon listing shows it in multiple locations.Charged them up, only 3 had red lights, the other no light at all.  Charged them all up on a wall charger.  Tried 2 of them in my camera.  No combination of batteries would last long enough for me to set the date.  Storebought Lithium Ion batteries (not rechargeable) last for months.  Very disappointed.Tried them in my tv remote, they seemed to work, but that's not what I bought them for.\n",
      "great so far ive had them for a bit now and they have worked flawlessly\n",
      "Packaging Seem to work fine - I've only had for couple weeks, can't speak to longevity.  Love the 1.5v, hard to find in a AA rechargeable (and plenty of things - especially water timers - need 1.5v)  Dinged for the packaging - I know, not really important but they come in a plastic case INSIDE the box- really?!\n",
      "Best investment Love it want to order morev,they do work best with the blink cameras\n",
      "Excelente Lo utilizo en mi computadora y es excelente\n",
      "They should sold these a long time ago 🤔 They not heavy like the regular batteries you buy and throw away. I was recommended these by a YouTuber so I thought I should check them out. When you take the top part out I though okay this going break but no it has some type of elastic.\n",
      "USB Batteries?! Worked as advertised+it's a pretty COOL idea.\n",
      "IT WORKS! I was super excited to receive this product and see that it actually works! Its honestly such a money saver and a great investment.\n",
      "Great value I only started using but so far it is great\n",
      "AA Lithium Rechargeables are a Must Have AA Lithium Ion rechargeables plug nto a USB port for recharging.  Each battery has a pilot light to indicate charging and when fully charged the indicator goes out.  These are a MUST HAVE.  Each set comes in a neat case.\n",
      "Buy rechargable and never run out They charge easily. I have decided to replace all of my AA batteries with USB rechargable batteries. They may or may not turn out to be a good deal economically, but they are certainly much better than running out of batteries. I'm waiting for USB versions of the other sizes.\n",
      "Great Best rechargeable battery ever\n",
      "Work well Batteries used for Blink security .. work well\n",
      "Not for cameras I bought these for a camera. They didn't have enough amps I guess. Normal AA bateries work not these. Maybe a TV remote would be fine.\n",
      "Good to keep a set as spares Very easy to charge, and great as you can keep them plugged in to any USB\n",
      "Absurdly short life span I needed lithium batteries for outdoor security cameras. I'm absolutely stunned by how short the life span is. Blink cameras say they last two years per battery, but in reality they were lasting six months. With these garbage batteries, I'm forced to recharge every two weeks!And the time it takes to recharge is absurd. Awful purchase. Deep regrets.\n",
      "Don't hold a charge After just a month or two, these batteries don't hold a charge. In \"standby\" my device, which should last up to 2 years on the same battery, lasts at most two weeks. VERY DISAPPOINTED! LOOK ELSEWHERE!\n",
      "No bueno very expensive, very little battery time, it was discharged very fast, in 4 hours of work the battery was already discharged\n",
      "Skip it They do not charge well or last long.\n",
      "OK Don't like it\n",
      "Spend money elsewhere Not even a full week in and one battery already does not hold a charge...\n",
      "Nice addition Should have gotten these a long time ago.\n",
      "Convenient to recharge I like lithium ion batteries and I use lots of batteries for cat toys. These work well, are convenient to charge and the light lets you know when they are ready. Only thing is I wished they charged faster but the charge seems to last a long time. I have bought several sets in various sizes. Saves lots of money.\n",
      "Was really surprised at how long the charge lasts Despite the cool factor of charging with USB, I was really surprised at how long these last on a charge.  So far, I have been really happy and plan to purchase more.\n",
      "Meh Overall I'm satisfied with the product. Yeah I had to charge the batteries before installing them in my outside security camera's.\n",
      "Questionable quality? Only 2 out of the 4 batteries charge correctly 2 out of the 4 batteries requires me to \"wiggle\" while being charged to trigger the red light (that means it's charging). Tried recharging the 2 suspect batteries on a different charger and still had the same issue.\n",
      "Awesome Everyone needs these.\n",
      "Works great for oculus touch controllers I use these in my oculus touch controllers and they last quite a few hours I use it daily and about once a week i have to recharge them.  There is no indication that they are getting low though they just either work or are instantly dead so its good to have the 2 not being used all charged and ready.  This is way better than buying regular batteries over and over.\n",
      "Great product Battery last a long time\n",
      "Great purchase Have these in my Blink camera and they are a blessing. For some reason the regular lithiums were not lasting these are holding up over a month now.\n",
      "Thanks! Got here quick!\n",
      "Work as advertised, but read the fine print These are very convenient to use because you can charge them at any USB port...on your laptop, in your car, or any phone charger. Plus their output voltage is a full 1.5 vol5s, where most NiCad or NiMH batteries output only 1.2 volts. Doesn't make much difference for flashlights or motor driven devices, but some elecronic devices may  have reduced.performance at the lower voltage.Only drawback is their capacity, due to shorter length necessary to accommodate the USB charging cap.  At 1200 mAh, they have less than half the capacity of NiMH rechargeable batteries, which are available up to 2850 mAh.\n",
      "Convenient Just received these, charged in an hour, so far I’m impressed, bought them for my remotes.\n",
      "They hold a charge for a long time!! Easy to put into ports for recharging, I'm always using something with usb ports put it in and in less then ten minutes all recharge, I wish it could work other sizes one is better then none.\n",
      "Love the USB charging The USB charging should be on all batteries! Excellent\n",
      "Rechargeable AA Batteries Easy to use USB rechargeable AA batteries.  I keep these on hand for travel.  Great for my shaver, earphones, and other AA run devices.  I can recharge them on my computer or my plug in power cube. They don't need any adapters or cables.  Don't know how the lifetime will be, but so far so good.\n",
      "works as expected My first try I've been running a mouse that uses AA battery.  Its been working for over 2 weeks without an issue.\n",
      "Great battery So convenient.  Love them.\n",
      "Can't tell if charged They, after only one charge, don't turn green when charged so have no idea when or if charged.\n",
      "Don’t last long Only lasted a week in Blink camera. I knew it wouldn’t last as long as non rechargable lithium but thought they would be better\n",
      "Great for blink camera Best bang for your buck; I use these for my blink and works like a charm.  Economical compared to always buying lithium battery’s if you like to always check up on your blink camera.\n",
      "Great battery life These are great.  Used then in a cat toy that would eat through batteries.  These confuse me how much longer they last than regular alkaline AAs.\n",
      "Not good if your buying for blink camera I Bought these for my blink camera s i charged them put them in they only last 4 days the one i have in back my camera just kept going off it only lasted 2 days i think id rather buy batteries to mucjh to chang e so often\n",
      "Great to use I purchased these to use with my wireless keyboard and mouse. I think it's a great idea to use these for items you don't tend to use often. Regular batteries have a tendency to explode slightly if left in for too long. Using rechargeable lithium-ion batteries saves time and money, and they fit just as well as a regular AA battery. Will definitely buy again.\n",
      "Bad design!!! I wanted lithium ion for the constant 1.5 volts. I use AA batteries in a wireless microphone and a wireless personal ear monitor in the worship band at my church. We do two services, so I wanted these to last through that. I charged them and took them to church, installed them, and... nothing. The devices wouldn't power on. I brought them home, recharged them, put them in a TV remote, then again, nothing. I studied the design, and seeing that the top came off for charging, I assumed that they were charged, just not making good contact. I tried again, this time putting the batteries in the device with the contact point (hinged side) of the batteries down, so as to keep pressure directly on the contact point. This time they worked. BAD DESIGN! I gave them a rating of 3, because I guess they work, however because you have to put the in a certain way, that is not very practical nor efficient. I can't speak as to the battery life or durability as of yet.\n",
      "quick charge, easy to use quick and easy, It would be nice to be able see the charge level\n",
      "Good so far. I've had these batteries for about a week. After charging them I put them into my mouse and keyboard, and haven't had to charge them since. I like how the batteries have a built in usb to plug them directly into my pc for charging. Other usb rechargables that I've tried have a micro usb port that has to be connected to a cord in order to charge them. So far the only thing I don't like is that the positive cap that covers the usb is connected with a tiny piece of elastic and with probably break easily. When buying these you have to know a couple of things. First these batteries are 1200mah and most nonrechargables are 1500mah batteries. This means that the rechargables won't last quite as long as nonrechargables before needing to be recharged. Also These batteries are lithium ion batteries, and will not function well in extreme cold! In my opinion these rechargable batteries are good to use in remotes, and controllers that stay inside the house.\n",
      "A different kind of battery that's stands out. Very interesting. Easy to use and charge\n",
      "Great for Blink camera These batteries are awesome,easy to charge and works good with my Blink camera\n",
      "Good They worker fine\n",
      "meets expectations This product met all of my expectations.\n",
      "Great batteries! Incredibly convenient! I love these batteries! The only thing I dislike is how much they cost. I'm not saying they are over priced. They are probably as inexpensive as possible and still make a profit but I would like more of them\n",
      "Nice rechargeable batteries. I like that you can just recharge them not have to buy new batteries.\n",
      "they work for my controller and gaming mouse however their lifespan is short and im causious cuz they seem they'll break easy\n",
      "Good battery life I'm using these for my Xbox controller and also an insulin pump. They seem to hold a charge well so far.\n",
      "Rechargeable batteries that save u money Great item, works as described. Charges from a USB port. There are indicator lights that tell you when it's full. I use them in a high drain device, so rechargeable batteries are def the best option. I will definitely buy more of them. Hope this helps you make a purchase decision. And fast shipping from Amazon, as always. AAAA++++\n",
      "Great batteries Would buy again works great\n",
      "Most definitely Yes\n",
      "great alternative for NiCad rechargables these AA batteries hold their charge for long and they are easy to charge\n",
      "Better than one use Fast charge time, easy to use, I use them in my flashlight, I prefer to re-use and recycle when possible and these do the job.\n",
      "Be careful removing battery from charging socket. Must be very careful when removing USB-A connector from USB charging socket as this may pull out USB-A connector from battery.  This has happened on two different occasions.  Even at the Lightning Deal price, this can be an expensive situation.\n",
      "👍 Such a great idea to have rechargeable batteries\n",
      "Good Buy Just got them and so far ….so good\n",
      "Work great They work great long lasting best to find a 4 piece charger Flat in a row sideways not up and down to charge them\n",
      "Charger free recharging This is a very clever way to design a battery. Rather than a dedicated charger the reliance on a USB plug add s a great deal of portability and flexibility. Does reduce charge capacity but still excellent given the convenience\n",
      "did not work how it should Did not last on my beard machine at all, under 2 minutes  and it dies! very disappointing\n",
      "Reliable exactly as advertised\n",
      "Money saving! I bought these for Blink cameras. I wish the life lasted a bit longer but works great for what I needed. So easy to recharge!\n",
      "battery life These batteries are amazing. I was using batteries most for my iMac magic mouse. For some reason, normal batteries didn't last long. In fact, they died very quickly. I used to use rechargeable batteries (which I charged using some charger device). But they didn't last either. These are instead doing very well. It's now a couple of weeks and my battery life showing 100%.\n",
      "Charge most anywhere Enables you to charge your batteries with a solar charger, car charger walwart charger, on your PC, Laptop, most anywhere.\n",
      "Very happy ! These were described exactly as pictured. When I received these they were fully charged as promised. I have been using these since the day I received them and they are great. I have not charged them yet and it’s been almost two weeks. They look like they are very durable. I’m very pleased with my purchase.\n",
      "Thanks Using these batteries about half year in my mouse and charged them 2 times only.(normal battery need to be changed once in a month)\n",
      "Great for door locks I use these batteries for my automatic door lock\n",
      "Absolute trash.  But a very cool idea. Full charge to dead in like 2 hours powering a flash light with a SINGLE LED!  Thankfully I planned for that and brought all 4 fully charged with me.I suspect these will fail catastrophically soon, but it's not worth my time to return them.  Do not buy these.  Probably anything else would be better.Pros: they are very light and definitely feel like lithium batteries.  The built in charger is a great concept.  I do like these and would like to see this become a viable product.\n",
      "easy to recharge with USB use it on daily basis, charges easily in my USB and ready to use when needed\n",
      "Great product. Great product, just need to extend battery life.\n",
      "Not worth it. Bought these batteries because I use batteries in my candles, hanging pics, and other decorations.  They are simple to charge. Charged them over 6 hours on my computer several times. They ONLY LAST ONE DAY!  Then I have to recharge daily!  Waste of money. Not recommended.\n",
      "DEAD AFTER 6 MONTHS OF USE The reason why I bought it is because to stop buying disposable batteries. However, it does not last long.\n",
      "Easy to charge I am an auto mechanic. I wear a LED headlight all day. It uses a single AA battery. I bought these so I could stop wasting money and throwing batteries into the trash. One battery last a little more than a day with regular use. I have four batteries so I am never without a fresh battery.Update- I have been using them for one year now. Battery life is a little shorter than when new but still working great. Definitely would recommend these for my type of use. Saved me over $200 on throw away batteries.\n",
      "These are probably best used for tv remotes. I guess I got a bad bunch. I charged these using my computers usb and waited for the red charging light to extinguish. I placed them into my sons RC car remote and it only lasted for 2 mins and I had to recharge again.\n",
      "Work pretty nice The only thing that I don't like is that I have have enough USB ports available to charge them. With kiddos tablets, phones, & everything, it would be better if they charged the same way as their AAA batteries charge. The AAA batteries are great, charge off of dongle that charges all four at the same time.\n",
      "Good idea. Bought these to use in s aC Crane am/Fm weather radio and a Kodak pix pro camera.  Fully charged the batteries would not turn on the camera and they were equally useless in the radio. They do work well in my TV remotes, thus the 3 stars instead of one.\n",
      "Rechargeable LIPO AA Batteries I had ordered two four packs because my quad controller requires When I had to recharge a 2nd time two of the batteries failed and got real hot.  I was using the same charger that I was using on my cell phone and tablet.  I have just ordered one more 4 pack to see if they will work or not.\n",
      "USB recharged - great flexibility I really like that these batteries are recharged via USB rather than in a dedicated AC powered charger. I also like that their chemistry is Lithium, with no memory effect. I've been using them in my pocket flashlight with good results. Their one drawback is the lower density mAH they offer vs standard rechargeables (a result of less space devoted to power storage; need space for charging circuit and USB plug). A great addition to a go bag.\n",
      "Perfect for my use! These are PERFECT for my use.I use these for the remote of my sleep number bed.I can understand the issues some people have about battery life. Though I feel these are perfect for remotes.Once my TV remotes need batteries, I will be popping these in.I did have to wiggle them into the remote, but they do fit.My last point is, chose what you will be using these for.  If it is something with high-power or constant use of energy, you may be better with old school  batteries.But for something with short zaps of energy, these will be great!\n",
      "These batteries are easy to use and will replace disposables! It is so easy to charge these batteries in any USB port.  They charge quickly and lights on the battery tell you when charging is done.  I have only had them for a month, but my keyboard is still showing 100% battery charge so the batteries seem to have a long life.  Time will tell how they hold up, but I'm planning to buy more to replace my disposable battery usage.\n",
      "Giant pieces of junk Take forever to charge and only last about 2 days in my blink camera. If it gets below 40 degrees they no longer work. Save your money\n",
      "Higher voltage than NiMH rechargeables These Li batteries took an hour to charge out of the box. My 4-star Battery Life and Durability ratings are provisional, since I've used the batteries less than a week. I use rechargeables in a Braun Pocket Mobile electric razor, whose running speed is limited by the battery voltage. NiMH run at 1.2 volts. The Sorbo box indicates an output rating of 1.5V, plus or minus .2V, or 1.3 to 1.7 V. The razor performance is noticeably better so far. I'm guessing I'll get ten days to two weeks out of a charge. Although the Braun is light, because it's intended to run on batteries and there's no charging circuitry, the Sorbo are also noticeably lighter than NiMH batteries, which is another benefit.\n",
      "Lasts as long as regular batteries Hard to get in package but are good.  We are currently using them in our roku remote, they last as long as regular batteries.\n",
      "Excellent Product! I purchased my first set of these in late October and they arrive fully charged in a durable storage case. Charging time is very rapid. I would guess somewhere between 2-3 hours. I've had a great experience with these. As far as rechargeable batteries go, these are the best. I didn't expect them to work as well as they do to be honest. I still listen to CD's on a Sony Walkman (I have a large CD collection) and it goes right through regular disposable alkaline batteries quickly. These last a noticeable amount longer. I would say nearly twice as long. I have replaced using disposable alkaline AA batteries with these. I recommend these batteries very much. You will not be disappointed with this product.\n",
      "Simple to charge! These batteries are Li-ion and great to use and super easy to charge. I wish they had a larger mah but I cant find them.\n",
      "They are usb I like being able to charge the batteries as opposed to throwing them away as well as the are USB chargeable. I just used them for the first time so I don't know about battery life. I am placing another order.\n",
      "Rechargeable is the future This was a fantastic purchase! I am so happy with the battery life! I have my xbox 1 controller on, like, all the time. I have 2 of em charging while i use the other two so i can play my games and watch my shows without worry of my controller turning off.\n",
      "As advertised These work great for my security camera!\n",
      "Environmentally friendly Never knew these existed. I’ve been sharing with my friends and I’m very excited to use a much needed resource that is now recyclable!\n",
      "good I like it\n",

      "usb batties So far so good Charged up with in 2 hours. Now we will see how long they will last\n",
      "Very Very good!!! I've always loved high-tech stuff, and I've always looked forward to having a USB rechargeable battery!Now my wish has come true!I am very happy to get it!!!\n",
      "Battery Life Importanta These batteries discharge very quickly!  Not a good buy.\n",
      "Great product for the $ Used for rechargeable speaker. Came in a couple days already charged for testing. Works great long life.\n",
      "Very convenient Good quality and much more convenient than a dedicated charger. An excellent purchase experience too. Thanks!\n",
      "Perfect for home or mobile use since everything has a USB port. I've own USB batteries since the early 2000's and I'm impressed to see the evolution of technology.Since my purchase, batteries have operated great with no issues.\n",
      "The Next Step in Rechargeable Batteries While rechargeable batteries are the answer for portable devices, carrying a battery charger means another portable device to haul around.  This is the next step in easy recharging with devices you're already carrying with you: phone charger, lap top, cigarette lighter USB power plug.  While the endurance isn't the greatest, the convenient recharging balances that out.  When these guys come up with a 2300 mAH version, they'll rule the world.\n",
      "You will need good multi charger to charge them all They work great, charge fast and long last-ing\n",
      "Time will tell I am using these to power temperature reporting transmitters in my two freezers.  Due to the low temp, batteries tend to lose power quickly and the only sensible thing to do is to buy rechargeable batteries.  So far, so good.  But it will be a while before I can say whether these will work particularly well.  So far the answer is yes, but the system I am using is not particularly reliable when compared to an actual thermometer.  As long as the upper limit alarm works, I'll be happy.\n",
      "a tempting idea I was given a pack of these for birthday gift. Here;s a tip to anyone looking to use these or give them as a gift. They a poorly made chinese toys. There is only one worthy Li-ion battery out there. I'll call them \"loops\".\n",
      "Great rechargable battery This is going to save  me some money buying regular batteries very good last a long time charges quickly.\n",
      "rubbish products it only keeps charge for short time, it looks good very convenient to use but does not last.\n",
      "Very Happy with this product. I purchased wireless security cameras that went through to many batteries. I also purchased the plugin charge port with these rechargeable batteries. Both work great and I would recommend.\n",
      "Power This is such a good invention in this time and era we see outlets = USB port!It works great for items like remote controls and wireless mouse.However, I've tried using this for trimmer (motored), but USB chargable batteries wasn't exerting as much power as ordinary batteries.\n",
      "Great product. Works as expected. No issues.\n",
      "Not bad at all Although i havent used this product a crap ton as i thought i would. So far its been a smooth experience with it. Other than that i dont really have ANY negatives to say I reccomend it for people to use on their TV remotes,Controllers(Wii or Xbox 360), or flashlights.\n",
      "work great bought these for my security camera, work great! charge quick!\n",
      "Great form but lacking in function. Wanting to give these batteries a chance to prove themselves, I delayed writing this review. I love the idea of popping the top and charging the batteries right from a USB port. In this respect, I am quite happy with the product. I can't yet speak about the longevity of the product, having owned them for only a few months and recharging them barely a handful of cycles. What I can say is that they don't have much of a charge and they don't hold a charge well at all.I bought these to power my son's Kodak Pixpro FZ43. Now I must qualify my review by admitting that I don't know anything about batteries or the power consumption of the camera. I am primarily interested in usability. Having said that I can only attest that the batteries last for about 40 photos before the camera shuts down after claiming the batteries are low. These are photos taken outside during daylight hours with no flash, with the camera remaining on between snaps and also using functions like the grid and telephoto. In other words, neither my son or myself were very much impressed.Another criticism is that the charged batteries have a very short shelf life. I charged all four batteries after my son's last picture taking session and we didn't need them again for about three weeks. When we attempted to use the batteries in the camera again we removed two of them from the protective case they came in and installed them in the camera. The camera wouldn't even begin to power up, indicating the batteries were completely dead. Of course, I checked to make sure the batteries were installed correctly and they were. I tried the second set of two batteries with the same results. After an hour and a half of charging time the batteries powered up the camera and were again good for around 40 shots or so.I can't recommend this brand of batteries. Hopefully, my experience is not typical and others are having better luck with them. I still like the idea and will try again with another brand in the near future.\n",

      "Light my way Would have had 5 but little hard to open package and no instruction hoe to open it\n",
      "Very convenient to use (in the right situation) These batteries are really easy to recharge and use.  They seem to work fine in any device.  There is only one draw back.  The total power that they can provide is similar to conventional batteries.  This might be expected, since so much volume is used for the USB port being built in (instead of being dedicated to more battery).These are perfect for a device is that not too power hungry and that you don't want to be wasteful buying batteries for all the time (like a wall clock, or LED candle).As the need arises, I will buy more of these again!\n",
      "I liked that the charger was built in One disadvantage you may want to consider is that the battery generates some rf noise.  I had to take it out of my ccrane radio because I could not receive weaker stations anymore.  I think the battery must be regulating with by switching the higher voltage down to 1.5V  In other applications it should work fine.\n",
      "Great Idea... Good Product..! Batteries are working great..! They work like a charm in my powered toothbrush. These need to hit the mainstream but I'm sure the big battery companies won't like these cutting into sales...\n",
      "Very handy. I use them on the blink battery powered cameras. Can’t complain.\n",
      "Cool design All in one design is very convenient.\n",
      "The future comes in the form of a battery I can't believe how easy it is to use these batteries. You plug em in whenever you need to as long as you have a USB port somewhere in your house.\n",
      "So convenient and fast, don’t last as long as name brand but close enough Love the ability to charge these anywhere there is a USB port (almost everywhere now).I placed in my high output flashlight that will kill a standard battery in 6 hours of high beam use. Batteries did well after 3 hours of continuous Halloween use, got home and checked batteries with a tester and still had a 1/4 of power left.So they are about 70-75% short of a name brand, but the 1 hour usb charge makes it everything I need for my flashlight and kids video game controllers. Definitely saving the environment.  We would go through 48 batteries a week.\n",
      "Great item value Love how they can be recharged through USB.\n",
      "Work fine! Very happy to not have to keep buying disposable batteries for my lap top charger.  These work great.\n",
      "Good, but not up to par with traditional lithium batteries These batteries are very easy and fairly quick to charge using any USB output device, such as a laptop/PC or other device charger.I have been using them for the better part of a year as an alternative to the Energizer Ultimate Lithiums, with no noticeable drop-off in capacity. They also fit the same as any AA battery.While these are serviceable, note that you will get neither the output nor the duration to match traditional lithium batteries.  I use these to power a wildlife/license plate camera, and so have had the rechargeables in constant rotation running 24x7. Where the Energizers will last for over two weeks (about 17 days depending on traffic) these batteries need to be replaced every 8-10 days.  The device also complains that they do not output the same power as a Lithium battery, but it does run fine, including infrared and flash.Saving a lot of money on batteries, so I’m happy with the purchase, but when I need to leave town for more than a week I put in the Energizers.\n",

      "Great battery Did as advertised.\n",
      "Disappointed Very disappointed. They are No better than a cheap regular battery.\n",
      "Muy funcional Me parecen fabulosas. Las tuve que cargar cuando llegaron y aunque no las he usado aun, parecen muy buenas y practicas.\n",
      "Meet the AA battery of the future It's hard to give a through review of these batteries without having run them through multiple charge/discharge cycles.That said they seem to work as advertised, they hold a charge for an amount of time that is comparable to disposaby batteries, they recharge easily and you never have to carry a specialized charging dock.I also bought a similar model of battery that recharges through a micro USB slot on the batteries side; the capacity of that version may be a little better (no on board charging circuit to take up space) but I prefer the convenience of this model.The reaction you get from people the first time they see you take off the end of the battery to reveal the USB charger never gets old; worth it for that alone. I'd be surprised not to see this design become the standard for AA batteries over the next few years.\n",
      "Poor performance I fully charged two batteries and inserted them into an Apple's wireless keyboard. I rarely use this keyboard and yet, the batteries were depleted in less than 3 weeks. Don't buy them!\n",
      "Works for my wireless mouse and remote control They're convenient and I don't have to worry about running to the store to buy new batteries or stocking inventory of AA battery when I need them. However, I only use them for devices that aren't constantly consuming the batteries (e.g. wireless mouse and remote controller)\n",
      "great idea I use small flashlights a lot at work these batteries keep me out of the dark, I usually get about 3 to 4 days use per battery before they need a recharge, also the light seems so much brighter than the regular batteries that I used before. Much better mileage for my light.\n",
      "It is important to know the battery life and durability. I use these batteries for several of my products that use this type of batteries.  These batteries seem to last longer than some. They are easy to use and are very durable.  I am pleased with this product.\n",
      "Works as advertised easy to use\n",

      "Great product if you don’t get any duds. I am using this product for battery powered security cameras. The battery life is good.However, 2 of the 8 batteries I ordered turned out to be duds.\n",
      "Great for game controllers! Very decent rechargeable batteries for the price. USB charging is absolutely the way to go!\n",
      "the duration when charged is not much. they don't last long, my rechargeable batteries last months, these do not last days. you can use with your security system but it won't last long at all.\n",
      "Real cool product Super cool idea and really convenient\n",
      "Don't waste your money on these rechargeable batteries! If you're looking for rechargeable batteries for your wireless mouse don't buy these.I was tired of replacing my batteries once a month in my wireless remote so I purchased these.Big mistake! Now I not only have to replace them every 2 weeks instead of 4 weeks but I have to recharge them too!I have kept track of battery life on each charge since I started using these and they have never lasted longer than 14 days! Sometimes 9, 11, 12 but never longer than 14 days which is a complete failure to me!No wonder they sell them in 4 packs because you will be needing to recharge and rotate so often you must have a backup pair for access to your computer.Hopefully they will last longer than a few months of constant recharging but if I'm recharging them every 2 weeks they'll probably burn out in a relatively short period of time.\n",
      "Well worth it. Works great, as expected.\n",
      "Great value for the money Very satisfied with the product and price\n",
      "Its good Works well but havent fully utilizing\n",
      "Charge them on most anything! These are really great. Well packaged and they work great. So many options to charge them up.\n",
      "Reusable reusable reusable I only gave 4 out of 5 because I haven't had them long and can't speak definitively as to the battery life or durability. They do charge quickly and lighter weight that standard bats. They should give max output until dead unlike regular bats that as charge drops so does the output voltage.\n",
      "1.5V rechargeable Light house of Roomba required 1.5V battery. Rechargeable Ni-Mh battery has short life because of its output voltage, 1.2V. This battery has longer life for the light house.\n",

      "I Love the Genius who came up with this idea! EXCELLENT IDEA & Well executed product.\n",
      "They don't last long on a charge I wanted to use these batteries for my keyboard and mouse. They only last a few days. My other batteries could last more than a month. Not useable for this purpose.\n",
      "Great batteries Works as advertised\n",
      "Useful if you don't want to waist batteries I got these because I didn't like the idea of wasting AA batteries anymore. I figured technology had gotten to the point where I should be able to recharge a battery that works similar to AA batteries. Now, the price is something I debated with myself over. Does the price of the battery justify the purchase? Well, that gets down to how many AA you can buy for the price of these. Furthermore, how long those batteries will last. The average Lithium battery lasts 5-7 years. Some have been known to last longer. Unfortunately, I don't have enough information. But, if you want to reduce the waste, it's about whether or not you feel like the price justifies the outcome.By the way, if you've bought batteries like these before and they were orange, it looks like those have been discontinued for these blue ones instead. The only difference is the orange ones glow green to indicate that they are fully charged. The blue ones don't. They just stop glowing.\n",
      "Not enough output I tested these with a digital multimeter, and also with a battery tester after charging these fully, (both showing them to be completely full and outputting the correct amount of power) and they last about 2 minutes in a Steam controller. For about 1 month, they'd last all day, easily. Not sure what changed, but now they are unusable. I won't be buying these anymore, even though I really love the idea and the charging method.\n",
      "Okay product Nice product. Works as described. Wish it held charge a little longer\n",
      "Cute idea. Only a month old.  Don't hold a charge.  Maybe for half hour.  Need re-charged everytime you try to use them.  Actual battery might be tiny.  I have never had luck with rechargables in the past.  Supposed to be newer technology  Had high hopes.  Oh well.  They didn't take too long to charge up if they just sit on the shelf so they hold some charge.  Red light goes out quicker if they aren't used in a device.  Buy big boxes of alkalines at Lowe's again..\n",
      "Great purchase... Very happy with this purchase. I'm using them in my blink security cameras and they work great!\n",
      "Cool way to recharge with USB charger. When your batteries don't charge is it a bad battery or your charger? This method to recharge takes the guesswork out. Using in my monitoring system. So far so good. I will review for battery life after a few months.\n",
      "WORK GREAT... ORDERED A SECOND SET.. WORK GREAT... ORDERED A SECOND SET.. MAKE SURE WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT GETTING SOME THE MAH [milli amp hour] IS AT LEAST 1000.\n",
      "These batteries might fool you into thinking they're super, but they're no better than NiMH These batteries read full charge until they just die all of a sudden, so I was fooled into thinking that they were fully charged but they really were not.  My NiMH batteries on the other hand, read low charge pretty quick, but I always recharged them when they got low.  This time I let them go longer once they got low, and they lasted much longer than I thought they would.  So the NiMH fooled me into thinking they were out when they really were not.The test:  4 of these batteries (new) vs. 4 Panasonic Eneloop NiMH (about 2 years old) in my security camera.  I ignored the battery indicator and just waited until they die.  The lithium died after 12 days.  The NiMH went 11 days and were still working but I think they were about out since I think it was missing some night vision pics (I think the camera misses some night vision pics once it gets low).  And if the NiMH were new they would probably do better.The conclusion:  These don't seem any better than NiMH.  They cost about twice as much.  They claim 1,000 charge cycles, where the NiMH claim 2,100.  I think I'll stick with the NiMH.  I returned the lithium batteries.\n",
      "Longer lasting for sure.. Used these in my racing scanner. Havent had to recharge yet. Performed well all weekend.\n",
      "I can't believe this wasn't invented sooner 5 stars just for being such a great idea. All 4 AA batteries charged up just fine, I haven't tried them out yet. At 1200 mah, they should have about half the capacity of an alkaline AA. Will update review once I've used them a bit. If they charge even 10 times they'll have \"broken even\" compared to 50¢ for an alkaline and anything beyond that is just a bonus.\n",
      "Would not recommend The batteries did not work at all, even when I charged them, and they didn't fit in my devices. It was too big.\n",
      "I must have The best thing ever made I'm really enjoying them they last for 3 days for me playing games\n",
      "One is a dudd. I've had these about two months and one doesn't even hold a charge anymore. The others seem to work but a single charge doesn't last as long as a disposable.\n",
      "They don’t last! Don’t waste your money. After reading some of the reviews I decided to give these a try. What a waste of money...  I bought these to use in an outdoor thermometer transmitter. Regular alkaline batteries were lasting a month during cold weather and about 1.5-2 months during warmer weather. Charged these up and replaced the alkaline batteries. Only to swap them out less than 2 weeks later!  I’ve swapped them twice now in less than a month. They work, which is why I gave at least one star. They don’t last at all, definitely way less than an alkaline, which is why only one star. Unless you are going to put them in something like a Wii remote that can be charged between uses, don’t even bother.\n",
      "Love it! Perfect! Works like a charm!\n",
      "Not worth the time I charged them. They worked for 20 seconds and then died.  I have them in my blink XT but don't waste your money as they are not lithium rechargable.\n",

After a full charge they work for about 5 hours and them go from very bright to barely seen.I haven't used them on anything else to test if its this particular light string or what.\n",
      "Very good batteries. I like rechargable 1 I charged these in 1 hour after receiving them.  I use them in a Radio Control Transmitter.  Alkaline batteries drop voltqage after 3 hours use, but these batteries held 1.5 volts after same use.  Very good batteries.  I like rechargable 1.5 volts better than the typical 1.2 volts for this application.\n",
      "Saves money Super easy to use and USB charges makes life so much better, will buy more\n",
      "Love these USB batteries Batteries always needed, even better if rechargeable. I like the fact that you can charge it almost anywhere a usb is available. I have a similar battery and it has served me well over a year and still going strong, so I am giving these a chance to see how these perform. I received mine in orange instead of blue and received a quick e-mail to explain the difference. A big thumbs up to the retailer. (Apparently orange has a red led when charging and green when complete. The blue battery indicates red when charging and turns off when charged).  1.5 volts as indicated compared to 1.2 volts of other rechargeables is the selling point for me. I’ve had low performance with 1.2 volts in the past. The downside for me is the small elastic band that attaches the cap to the body of the battery. Not a deal breaker but I wish it was magnetic like the other brand I have. Overall I like it.\n",
      "Old Camera Works Again These Batteries resurrected my Canon Powershot SX100IS Camera.  The camera would shut down after a few minutes with other batteries, saying they were not charged.  Even brand new batteries would not work.  Since the USB Rechargeable AA Lithium Batteries deliver full current until they are discharged, the camera works perfectly again!\n",
      "I got these a couple of weeks ago and so far I like them They charge pretty quick and when you plug them in they have a red light that shines until they're charged which is nice.. I do recommend getting one of those usb wall chargers with multiple ports I happen to have one with 4 ports already and it's really convenient\n",
      "Five Stars neet\n",
      "Worth the money I bought these for my Blink security camera, once i charged them up and installed them they work beautifully, now if you compare the cost of these compared to energizer disposable these are way cheaper because of the fact they are rechargeable, now the first set that came in the camera lasted a year so it will ne interesting to see how long before the first recharge.\n",
      "Solid choice for xbox one controllers Bought these to use in my xbox one controller. they work really well and hold a charge for longer then single use battery's. only thing that sucks is the xbox controller wont warn you when these are low on power.\n",

      "To my happy surprise, I researched and found these I didn't even know these existed. I use AA batteries in my wireless mikes. I wondered if there was a such thing as rechargeable lithium batteries. To my happy surprise, I researched and found these. They have been a perfect solution to forever replacing batteries.\n",

      "Very cool! Very cool - especially when combined with one of those new outlets with built-in USB ports!  They mimic a AA exactly and, unlike NiMHs, provide the full 1.5V of an alkaline rather than a reduced 1.2V.  Remains to be seen how the battery life is - both initially and after a few recharge cycles - but otherwise they're a cool findUpdate: Been over a year now and they’re still going strong.\n",

      "Great for BlinkXT or any device that needs lithium batteries Only been about a week but so far I LOVE these rechargeable lithium batteries. I bought these to use in my BlinkXT wireless cameras because they only take lithium batteries and I like my cameras to record a lot. The original lithium batteries that came with the blink were supposed to last 2 years, the died within 1 week because my settings are all the way up and they record all movements. I thought I'd spend a fortune on batteries then I came across these babies. The have been great!!! Super easy to charge, I bought 3 packs - so, 12 total. They charged super fast and have been lasting, I love being able to see how much money I'm saving because I get to charge these instead of buying new batteries all the way. I bought some rechargeable AAA batteries lithium ones from another company too. They've been great! I would 10000% buy again.\n",

      "Five Stars The batteries work as listed and last long enough for what I'm using them for before needing a recharge.\n",
      "Full 1.5v AA rechargeable Most rechargable AA, AAA, etc batteries are not able to output the same 1.5 volts a nonrecharable alkaline battery does when new.  Most devices are able to work anyway, but some devices are more sensitive.  This rechargable output 1.5 volt when charged and seems to have good capacity.\n",
      "Generally satisfied but would prefer something with more energy Convenient way to avoid the battery trap. I use for my apple mouse, though it does not work nearly as long as regular batteries (a couple of weeks, typically), and gives no notice of charge ending (just ends precipitously). Generally satisfied but would prefer something with more energy.\n",

      "Easy to charge and long lasting. I really like these rechargeable batteries. The use a standard usb port to charge. It took a few hours to charge all 4, but the 2 batteries I've been using in my GPS unit lasted all day (8 hours) and a couple hours the following day. I have multiple charging ports already for phones and computers and so I have plenty of places to charge these batteries up. So far, I like them more than conventional rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "Five Stars Only recharged them once but so far they perform as advertised.\n",
      "Great concept!  Well done! Bought 2 packs and my kids liked them so much that I bought another pack!  We all think it is so much easier now to recharge the batteries!  Happy so far!

It charged in just over 2 hours and it was back to 100%. I like that this is a rechargeable that hits 1.5V rather than other rechargeable at 1.25 volts. I also appreciate that I don't need to have a dedicated battery charger as you just need a USB device (which there are a ton around). I want to try it on other devices that might have a higher, but shorter period drain such as a flashlight. But it works great!\n",

      "Five Stars Great product. Quick charge and has held that charge.\n",
      "Expensive but worth it if you go through batteries quickly. My wife loves these! We use them for remotes that are used a lot. They are a worthwhile replacement for standard AA batteries. Coming in a 4 pack means that using them on a device that only needs 2 batteries at a time ensures that when they run down the others are ready to go, and recharging does not take very long either.\n",
      "Good USB batteries. Good Batteries. Hold charge stability. Recommend to all.\n",

      "They work and are neat. They are cool, charging all at the same time is a pain. Would be great if they added a usb splitter with these so you could charge all at once if need be.  Also the little elastic being used will wear out over time depending on use or not. Should have used something more robust for it.\n",

      "Used them in my travel beard trimmer after and it worked great with maybe a fraction slower speed than a standard ... Bought the four pack with the blue batteries. They don't seem to have the same green finished charging light as the 2 pack orange ones. There is a red light for charging but then it just goes out after a bit. I am unsure if it doesn't have the green light or if there is actually a malfunction and they are not charging fully. I tried charging all four batteries. Used them in my travel beard trimmer after and it worked great with maybe a fraction slower speed than a standard AA. (unscientifically tested by the different sound frequency i heard) It cut just as good. All in all I just don't know if they were built without the charged light or if they are defective. Its that lack of peace of mind that gave it 3 stars. maybe someone else with the four pack could weigh in if they're having the same issueUPDATE: The company emailed me and it turns out they switched all batteries to blue now and they no longer have the green charge light. It's nice to know they are working properly. When compared to a standard AA in my beard trimmer they still seem slightly less powerful but only just.\n",

      "Really long battery life, a little annoying to charge. I've tested out many different AA batteries (lithium and NIMH) and I have to say that these lithium batteries are really delivering on capacity and weight compared to the NiMH counterparts.After using these in a wireless controller; I was able to MORE THAN DOUBLE the battery life of other rechargables that I have used in the past.Admittedly those are not the highest capacity rechargables but still its MORE THAN DOUBLE the battery life.These things are a pain in the neck to charge though as they use a USB cable to charge each one. While this means you don't \"need a charger\" you also can't charge all 4 unless you have one of those multi-port charging stations... and even then you will have to eat up the entire station just to charge these...I cannot really fault them otherwise though; as the capacity is so good and the weight is also lower. If you want to invest in lithium batteries; these ones or the other ones from the same brand that don't have these built in chargers are a good option.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!\n",
      "Very Low amperage output, these are JUNK. 1.  I bought 2 packages.  Intended use is a 3 cell Maglight with LED bulb.2.  The packages arrived appearing to be identical, each has an included charging cable.3.  The USB ports on the batteries are different.  1 battery came with a USB port the matched the charging cables, the other three had an entirely different type of port.  I happened to have a cable the fit and ensured all 4 batteries were at top charge prior to using them.4.  Dropped three of the batteries in the Maglight and the brightness laughable.  based on the advertised specs, this should have been hot to go.5.  Ensured I had no issues with corroded contacts and rotated the battery position in the Maglight.  No difference.6.  These are made in China so Quality Control is obviously non existent.7.  Don't buy this product they are essentially useless.\n",
      "great FANTABULOUS PRODUCT!Very quick charge cycle makes these work great for anything you need. Including devices that require good batteries like smoke detectors. I have used them in everything from wireless mice, tv remotes, remote control cars, and flashlights and have been very impressed.\n",
      "Made well and long lasting! These batteries last about 3Cool package,case, USB charger chord and OTB plug into the side of the battery, which is well built and rigid!They recharge by USB, making it so convenient.hours.Can't wait to see how they hold up over time.I bought these as a replacement for my plug and play battery packs and I have really been impressed with the longevity of each charge.\n",
      "Strong thoughtful battery product These batteries are great, so far I haven't had any problems with them, I will continue to use them and after some time passes, I will come back and edit this review to let everyone know how the batteries Fair after extensive use.\n",
      "Awesome product! My son was so excited as soon as these arrived in the mail because he had a few toys that had died and we were entirely out of regular batteries and all our rechargeable ones were in use. I let him know that he would still need to wait for a while before they were charged but then read on the package that they were ready to go! We loaded up a bunch of things he was waiting to enjoy and they all took off.\n",
      "Well worth the money I like everything about these batteries, charger, and the new type charging cables. I charged them when I received them, and have not had to recharge any of them yet. I highly reccomend them to every one.\n",
      "It's better than the original battery the monitor came with! It will last most of the day without needing to recharge.The original battery was getting us only about 30 minutes and this one is getting us 2+ hours at least.I'm not sure exactly how many since we charge it so often but the battery life is really great now.Wish I had know about this battery sooner.With a new battery, I don't have to charge for a day or two.\n",
      "Worth the Price These are priced a little higher than some rechargeable AA's, but the convenience and performance are worth it.The magnetic charging cables work like a charm.  Simply plug the USB cable into your charger or USB port, then bring the magnetic lead over the top cap of the battery and it will snap itself into place.  It's a quick charge, fully charging your battery in under 2 hours.My capacity tests resulted within 10% of the rated capacity (2000mAh), which was pretty good considering they were running a circuit with a buck converter eating up some of the efficiency.The size is very accurate, being only slightly longer (within about 0.2mm) than a standard alkaline battery, and nearly identical in diameter.My only complaint is that the instructions printed on the box were nearly impossible to read, due to both the size of the font and due to the color of the text not contrasting well with the background color.  However, I also noticed an error in the text on the box, claiming the leads would light red while charging and green when complete.  In fact, the leads light blue while charging.  I would refer to the instructions here on the product page for more accurate information and to spare straining your eyes trying to read the box.I'm very happy with these and would highly recommend them for anyone in need of rechargeable AA's.\n",
      "Forget buying normal batteries Friggen great idea i hate buying batteries. Everytime i need new batteries for something im buying a set of these. Easy to charge as they are magnetic and the light change color when they are charged.\n",
      "Very good battery These batteries are worth it! Saving the planet, plus I know I’ll always have a fresh set of batteries for my precious tv remote!  They seem to last just as long as normal batteries, if not a little longer.\n",
      "nice batteries; charge cables are inefficient I’ve used lots of rechargeable batteries over the years, including NiCad and NiMH batteries.  But I’ve started shifting to rechargeable lithium batteries because they hold a charge a lot longer than other rechargeable types can, especially when not in use for a long time.  They also tend not to develop a “memory” when charged frequently.This particular AA rechargeable battery set includes four AA lithium batteries, a plastic battery storage case, and two magnetic charge cables.  This set does not come with an AC-USB adapter.The magnetic charge cables are pretty interesting, although somewhat limited in utility.  Each cable has two heads, and each one magnetically attaches to the positive end of a battery and charges by USB.  The downside is it can only charge two batteries at a time, so you have to use both cables and tie up two separate USB ports to charge the four batteries.  The cables are also very short, so this method of charging is only useful if you’re charging them very close to a computer or USB charging hub.  This is not very efficient at all, although it may be a good solution for someone who travels and doesn’t want to lug around a typical box charger.  While charging, each magnetic head gives off a blue light that turns green when charging is complete.  It took several hours to fully charge the batteries.  Once charged, though, they work great in any device using AA batteries.Overall, this is a nice set of rechargeable batteries.  It’s an expensive set, but when you consider the cost of AA alkaline batteries these days, it should save a lot of money down the road, especially when used in battery hogs like toys, flashlights, and camera flash attachments.\n"

      "rechargeables with a magnetic cord, easy I have usb ports for charging in every room of my home so I find this type of battery convenient.  These are different though from some of the others I have that were micro usb.  These have a magnetic tip that just sticks to the positive of the battery.  Once the connections is made, they light up blue as they are charging.  You don't need to get out your glasses to charge these!!  If they do not last long, I will update this.\n",
      "Worth the price. Almost all children's toys require batteries, and they have to be changed in a few days, which is too wasteful! With these rechargeable batteries, the USB interface can be directly charged separately, which is convenient, practical, and durable! Save more money!\n",
      "Move aside NiMH, Lithium is here. While these batteries may seem a tad pricey, if you think about how many alkalines they will be replacing, it's a great value. The best part of these batteries is that they maintain their 1.5V throughout their charge rather than the lower 1.2V of a standard NiMH. This really makes a difference in situations where the voltage tolerances are a bit tighter. For example, when playing my LCD modded GameBoy Color, 1.2V batteries would sometimes flake out when loading games from a flash cart because of the power draw. I didn't have that issue at all with these batteries because they maintained their 1.5V throughout. The charging cables snap easily to the tops of the batteries and the light indicators tell you when it's charging and when it's done. As my budget allows, I will be picking more of these up in the future.\n",
      "These are awesome So I got these Fuvaly rechargeable AA batterieslithiumThese are really cool batters and charger cable. They come with four lithium AA batters in a plastic see throw case and the two charging cables. The charging cables have two separate charging ports of there own and are magnetic witch I love. When they light up blue they are charging and green they are fully charged.I haven’t ran them dead yet so I can’t say exactly how long they will last. I did put them in a flash light and turned it on for a solid hour and the light never lost any brightness to it. I would have left it on longer to test the longevity of the batteries  but the flashlight was really hot so I wonted to cut it off. Pretty positive the heat was from the tiny flash light not the battery. I really like these and I’m going to be purchasing some just like this for AAA batteries as well. I would highly recommend\n",
      "Nice Set of Rechargeable Batteries I wanted to see how this new style charging system works.Pros:- Simple to attach- Quick Charge time- 2 sets of charging cordsCons:- Takes an outlet or port for each pair of batteries- No Outlet AdaptersSo I received this item and immediately unboxed them to see how this works.What you get:4x AA Rechargeable 1.5v 2000 mAh batteries2x USB-A (3.0) cablesThese batteries can connect to an outlet or a laptop or hub.  Of course, if you want to attach them to an outlet, you will have to provide your own USB-A adapters for the cords.  The cords have a USB-A(3.0) end and the other end has two magnetic adapters that connect to top of positive (+) side of the batteries.  Once connected the magnetic adapter turns blue for charging and green when charging is complete.  The box stated that the batteries are Li-ion batteries.  However .. nothing on the batteries themselves says they are Lithium.  The batteries also have not code on them so you cannot tell by the CR number either.  The battery is slightly different from a standard AA rechargeablebattery.  The top has a circular opening in the middle and you can see a small circuit board inside the top of the battery.  It appears to be open and not windowed so I would recommend NOT getting these wet.The batteries charged fully in just under an hour and a half and so far have worked just as well as my current set of rechargeable batteries.  I will update this review if the longevity does not pass muster but so far they are performing well and I really like the easy magnetic connect and disconnect of the battery system.\n",
      "Super easy to use The quality is great. It is super easy to use. I love that it isn't a big bulky charger.\n",
      "Work Well This is a set of 4 AA batteries and 2 double charging cables. The batteries are standard AA size with a capacity of 1.5 V. The 2 charging cables are USB A on one end with 2 magnetic heads that clamp on to the positive terminals of the batteries. Also included in the box is a hard plastic case for the batteries.I find these batteries work quite well in my trail cameras. They hold a charge and last for several thousand shots in the cameras. The charging cables are very cool and easy to use. You can charge all 4 batteries with just 2 USB slots (transformer not included). Overall, this is a handy battery set, great for travel.\n",
      "Rechargeable battery industry changing for the better... I really like the magnetic charging cables. But you might be wondering if they'll charge other rechargeable AA batteries, sadly the answer is no. The positive end of this battery is specifically sized to fit the magnetic connectors. But they'll probably be compatible with other batteries that were made for these types of usb magnetic connectors because I'm sure many will be universal.I think USB rechargeable batteries will be game changers. It's not as if I've never had rechargeable batteries, I think we all have. But do we ever use them enough? It seems I'm never prepared with a fully charged set. I probably don't even remember where the charging case and power adapter is. So it's always quicker to grab the regular alkaline batteries, instead of looking for the charger, and then wait for the batteries to recharge. I'm hoping these USB batteries will change my habits because of the convenience of charging them where we spend a lot of our time, at the computer table. Also, nowadays we have usb charging ports all over the house. So we'll see...\n",
      "It’s been almost a month and so far, so good☺️These batteries come with a tiny plastic case tat I kept to store the 2 batteries I’m not using yet.  When they arrived, all were charged about 80% as it only took about 35 minutes to get the “green light” signaling a full charge.  It was quite easy to charge them once we plugged the cords in FIRST and added the batteries last.The other big of difficulty came when we tried inserting the batteries into the remote.  These hi-capacity, rechargeable lithium’s seem to be a bit wider than the standard copper tops and were hard to get into the remote!  I was afraid they weren’t going to work.  I needed help getting the in the remote and I have NO IDEA how they’re ever coming out🙉, but for now, we’ve got power👍All things considered, easy to use, great concept and excellent for the environment; beware of potential snug fit✨\n",
      "good battery life Pros:- very long battery life, charge one time, I can use it for my remote Drone for one week.- easy to charge, it work for normalI phone charge.- There is indicator inform when full, turn green-  small charge, doesn't has to use a lot of space of storage- easy to useCons- doesn't comes with % of battery life on battery, but $20 something is worth of money- charge can take little time to be fully charge\n",
      "Doesn't get hot, saves me money on batteries I have been using these in a personal fan while at work and I am quite surprised they last my entire work day on a charge. Many lithium rechargeables get hot in flashlights and other high power draw devices, but these don't. Definitely worth it over consuming 2 alkaline AAs over the course of 2 days.\n",
      "So Far So Good I just recently received these batteries, so I can’t yet comment on longevity. I will update my review in the future if I find they don’t live up to my expectations. So far I really like them. They came mostly charged, or at least enough to power my little necklace fan that requires two AA batteries. It was a little bit of a challenge attaching them to their charging cords and plugging them in without them disconnecting themselves. I would recommend first plugging the cords in, then attaching the batteries one at a time. Each charging cord has a light where it attaches to the batteries, blue while they’re charging and green once they’re charged. For some reason one battery’s light took several hours longer than the others to turn green, but they are all charged now. I love having small, portable USB charging cords instead of a big, bulky charger that you have to plug into the wall.\n",
      "nice batteries These are a nice set of batteries. came charged and ready to use. I used them in my son's toys and it is still going strong. I am planning to sue them with my Philips charger but the portable chargers which came with it is quite unique. I will give it a try too. its nice to have a backup or for travel etc. It is at right price point and going strong.\n",
      "This is the next level in batteries. A Strong BUY. PROS:- The new thing here is the way the batteries are charged... via magnetic attachment to the battery's positive end. - A full charge is achieved in less than 2 hours.- The batteries are the longer-lasting 2000mAh which have the high-power capacity of 1.5volts.- According to the seller's description, these lithium batteries \"can be recharged 1000+ times\".CONS:- None.\n",
      "Batteries are easy to charge and hold a charge a long time  These are great for parents with kids burning thru batteries for gaming remotes. The charging cord lights up red when charging and turns blue when fully charged. These took about 2 hours to fully charge. We are happy with how long they hold a charge.\n",
      "Nifty Idea I like the method of recharging these batteries.  instead of trying to remember where you put the charger and setting it up, this comes with magnetic connection usb chargers.  Seems like a good idea.  They batteries came charged, put them on a tester when they arrived and they had the right charge.\n",
      "cool products I bought these for my husband, he thought it was cool that they can be charged via USB chargers. We used the batteries for things are battery operated, such as soap dispensers. They work well so far.\n",
      "Great rechargeable batteries! Great, easy to charge batteries, very fast charging and long lasting batteries!\n",
      "At last, true 1.5V AA rechargeable batteries. These batteries are great.  Ever since I replaced all of my NiMh batteries with pre-charged like Eneloops and Duracells, I haven't seen any batteries that caught my attention until this.  I love the pre-charged batteries, they have a very long shelf life.  The only problem is it is only capable of delivering 1.2V.  Some appliances and toys don't run as effective using 1.2V LSD batteries.  Particularly those with motors, they may run but can be slow and dragging.  These rechargeable Lithium batteries solved that problem.This comes with 2 pairs of chargers.  The only thing I noticed is that it heats up the batteries during charging.  Luckily, I have a 4-position charger for these batteries and I am just gonna use these cords for​ emergencies.The only other gripe, for now, is the initial cost.  Maybe when there's already a lot of manufacturers then the price will stabilize.\n",

      "Great batteries. 1.5 volts. Holds a great charge for a long time I love using lithium ion type batteries because they are 1.5 volts which what they should be and they hold a charge a long time. Using regular alkaline batteries is a waste of money and helps  to destroy the planet. Nickel metal hydride batteries are the most popular rechargeable battery but their voltage is only 1.2 volts and most electronic devices end up not working right because of the low voltage. I love the magnetic connections for recharging\n",
      "Clever Rechargable Batteries - Highly Recommended These Rechargeable AA Batteries 1.5V 2000 mAh are perfect for most home and small business use. We go through a lot of AA batteries in our various electronics, so looking into rechargeable batteries only makes sense.The batteries come with the charging cables that are magnetically held on and work well in everything we tried them in. They last a long time when not in use and seem to hold the charge well.Highly Recommended!CFH\n",
      "Read pro and cons before making the purchase The size of the batteries are a little bit wider than regular batteries, so I have to squeeze it to the place.Pro is strong and unique design. Once it’s charged, it lasts really long and powerful. The toys I used it can run longer.Con: I wish the charger can charge other rechargeable batteries. It’s not compatible with others. The tip where is used to connect the positive side to charge doesn’t fit my other rechargeable batteries.I gave three star because the size and non-compatibility.\n",

      "AA Lithium technology, a full 1.5 volts, super simple charging design, and lots of recharge cycles.  This four-pack of 2000 mAh rechargeable lithium AA batteries are a great option if you go through alkaline batteries like I do.  This is my first experience with this form factor of lithium battery.  The brand name AA/AAA rechargeables that I have used in the past were very disappointing.  They were nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) and nickel-cadmium (NiCAD) batteries.  These types of batteries are heavy, they do not hold a charge over time, they have a very limited number of recharge cycles, they can hold a memory (you lose capacity), and typically their voltage is not greater than 1.2 volts.  This is bad for devices that require the full 1.5 volts that an alkaline battery provides.I am hoping these AA lithium batteries hold up because they are a great solution for me. I tend to go through a lot of AA/AAA batteries, especially in my TV remotes, wireless computer mouse, and so many other devices that use AA batteries.  This purchase was an expensive first investment, however, over time, I expect them to pay for themselves.  I have spent a lot more on regular alkaline batteries from Costco (and those NiMH/NiCAd batteries) so I am excited about how these will perform.These batteries look to be built very solidly.  I am glad they have circuit protection for low-voltage and overcharge-protection, as well as some other safety features. Charging these could not be easier with the included magnetic wires, however, it looks like you can charge these with a 5 volt  AA size wall charger (not included).With the one-year warranty, I feel confident about giving these a try and not worried about wasting my money. So far I am more than happy.\n",
      "useful I bought this battery and it has been in use for some time.It comes with a charging interface, doesn't use  extra charger. it is very convenient and practical.I like it.\n",
      "2 out of 4 packs had a defective battery Plan on at least one round of returns, as 50% of the packs I have been shipped have had issues preventing the battery from outputting any power, and in some cases, preventing them from even completing a circuit. This company has serious quality control issues.\n",

      "Good diy Diy is very good, very fun, I don't know how long it can be used, but there is no problem with it now!  You guys can try\n",
      "Good Product Best rechargeable batteries we have ever purchased.  Highly recommend.\n",
      "Amazing batterys for the price When they arrived, I charged them fully with the type c connections, installed them in my pump for gas.It's been almost two months and no need to charge yet.Use. 10 minutes a week. But they are left out side in the weather .\n",
      "Like the batteries, hate the short usb recharging cord. I like the way the charging lights change color.  Wish there was some way to lengthen the multi usb charging cord. I need to find some sort of usb to usb extension cord or they need to make an micro usb to a regular usb adapter. I guess I could buy an extension cord to allow me to charge them on my desk.\n",
      "convenience and made well there are so much ele-toys for my baby in the house, and go through tons of traditional batteries. this is exactly what i have been looking for. they recharge by usb, making it so convenient! and red and green light ring will lets you know if they are charged or not. the design of small charging port is smart, the top twists to keep out dust while using or storing. i definitely will buy more to replace many other aljalines.\n",
      "Really works Works great!\n",
      "Recommended for pocket flashlights and the such I use these in a stream light stylus and I feel like the life is fair , and the weight is definitely reduced ALOT. Seems to keep its brightness very high for a longer time too versus nicad batteries\n",
      "battery The battery is great. After a full charge, the red light goes off. A charge of about two hours is enough. I put it in the soap dispenser. That's great. You don't have to keep buying batteries.\n",
      "Very convenient! The best part of these batteries are able to be changed by USB. I had to bring a battery charger with me when I travel before. Now I only need to bring a cable. This pack includes a 4 in 1 usb cable so all 4 batteries can be charged all at once. There is light indicator on each battery, red is charging and green is fully changed.Very good product.\n",
      "Doesn't hold charge too long They're okay, and it's a nice idea, but after fully charging, these don't hold the charge for long. If you don't use the device on a regular basis and recharge when needed, you'll find the batteries drained when you need them. Recommended for devices that are used frequently. If you put them in a flashlight that's tossed in a drawer or stored in the glove box, you'll be disappointed when you need it.\n",
      "So much better than alkaline! I have to say, these are very useful and efficient to have. The overall size of the batteries are no problem too, they fit in anything that takes AAA batteries, and it beats having to constantly buy alkaline batteries and throwing them away when they are no good. It does help out the environment too by preventing more batteries from going into the landfill. Recommended to everyone\n",
      "Great! This is a great chargeable battery. It could be charged by USB cable, so much convenient! The cable come with the batteries is a four-end cable, which allows four of the batteries to be charged at the same time. I used these battery for two weeks, but I haven't charge for the second time.\n",
      "Work very well These USB Rechargeable AA Batteries work very well. The charging time is rapid. I use them for my son's toys. The batteries last longer than what I expect. I am very satisfied with them.\n",
      "Agree with I got these because I prefer using rechargeable batteries to help reduce battery waste. They hold their charge for quite awhile it took me several gaming sessions to even need to change them out and recharge them. The charge is pretty good, I don't know exactly as I usually charge them up overnight, using a standard battery charger.\n",
      "very convenient Honestly was skeptical at first. But I use it for my graphing calculator and the batteries get the job done. It’s also very convenient because the charger is portable and not at all bulky. I haven’t tried charging it yet and am still testing to see how long the batteries can last.\n",
      "Excellent! Batteries have lasted as promised, easy and intuitive to use, and I love not having to throw away old batteries and just charging overnight, and presto, I am good to go for another few weeks with my mouse and keyboard.\n",
      "FUVALY, What a cool way to build a battery I use Puck lights with a light sensor and a motion sensor so that my family can walk into a room in the dark and a light will come on and stay on as long as it sees motion. These are neat devices, and they all require 3 AAA batteries.I have purchased 3 sets of the Fuvaly Lithium AAA batteries along with a clever USB changer.Since I have 4 puck lights requiring 3 batteries each, I now have complete coverage and I can simply pop the batteries out, plug them into the USB charger, and then plug it into the wall outlet near that puck light site.  In about 1/2 hour, the red charging lights turn green, and I simply put the batteries back.No more fiddling with a charger stuffed in an upper cupboard.Update:: I got the AA versions of the battery, and am not as impressed.  I had batteries require more than one charge cycle before failing in a mouse application.  They all glowed green but quickly discharged.  I finally have one that worked in a mouse, so we will see how the rest perform long term.\n",
      "good I start to use rechargeable battery and try to be environment friendly. This one is really good. the way to charge this battery is really good. and fast recharged. It is better.\n",
      "Great for trips Used a bit over a month and I really like this. Super helpful when going on hiking or camping trips! Can be charged in the car or with a battery pack. I will buy more if this last.\n",
      "Very useful with practical charger I use these for my aviation headset. The charger is great for charging the other two batteries while I'm using the first two.\n",
      "Using in a smoke detector.. no problem so far for months! Bought to replace our smoke alarm batteries... works great! Had in for months now.. still no chirping smoke alarm battery signals.. so I know they're working.  Not too shabby , and usb rechargable pretty quick .. seemed to charge in 2 hours or so.\n",
      "The batteries of the future ! Do yourself a favor and save some money, along with saving the environment, and get those !Between my Oculus and X-box controllers, I was using a LOT of batteries and in same time money. I found a video of those on YouTube and decided to test them. Best decision ever.The batteries arrived holding already a steady 1.5v charge (even before charging them). I had rechargeable batteries before, that you have to put in their special charger compartment, and took like the whole day to charge. But those one charges from empty to full in a couple of hour max !Love the charging light status on top of the batteries (red = charging and green = charged) and the convenience of the MicroUSB charging system, with the little top you can twist to open or close the charging port. Only down side of this system is that you have to be careful to be sure you're inserting the MicroUSB cable the right way into the battery cell,  and never force it in if it does not fit, or you will damage the charging port, like I saw some people reporting on some review. The use of a USB-C charging port instead will have been better in my opinion to avoid that issue.But non the less, those are great and I even have the feeling they last longer than my regular batteries.\n",
      "Amazing!! I am going to replace all my batteries in the future. This is amazing\n",
      "Awesome Love it\n",

      "Well made, work as expected Use them in my David Clark PRO-X2. As expected they dont last as long as nicad but if I don't use the Bluetooth I can get 7 day runlife. Much faster than the normal rechargable batteries, the 4 plug micro USB is great.\n",
      "Great rechargeable batteries with USB cable or charger I love the idea that we get to charge the batteries with one USB cable. I have bought another brand of the same kind. This brand even has another option that we can use our own existing charger.My baby has all kinda toys that are batteries operated. Rechargeable batteries are more ecofriendly and these work perfectly. These last pretty well for my baby's toy and seem to last similar to the regular batteries and rechargeable batteries of the other brand.Would highly recommend these.\n",
      "Love these Charges quick and lasts a good amount of time I like these so ordering extras.  They are light so I was worried but they perform well in the various devices I’ve tried so far.\n",
      "Good for my new wireless Xbox controller Bought a new controller during this special stay at home period. I don’t want to buy a bunch of battery cuz batteries can be environmental polluted. The rechargeable batteries work great on my controller.\n",
      "So cool I like it so far. Fully charge this item is very fast.Including super cool cable and it looks like tree roots.It have four cables combine together.Battery is long lastng each one has 1500mah\n",
      "I just need a few I don't need to buy a lot of batteries anymore, it's rechargeable and can be reused, which is great.When the battery is dead, you can find charging devices everywhere, much better than my disposable batteries.\n",
      "Very efficient charging Charging is super fast! If only take about 1hr to fully charged. Compared with traditional rechargeable batteries, the charging time is significantly reduced by at least 7x\n",
      "well designed I have to admit I have not used these yet, waiting for my disposable batteries to die, I have them charged and ready to go. First impression is that the design is impressive and made with purpose in mind.\n",
      "Ok but not there yet. Good idea but not enough capacity. NiMH equiv D cells usually have 10AH vs this 5AH. Maybe if they got rid of the micro sub socket... The 5 hr charge time is also pretty slow.\n",
      "Good design where you don’t need bulky chargers to charge them. Like the design of these batteries. Unlike the traditional ones where you place them in a charger to charge, these set of four batteries have the charging cables plug directly into the batteries avoiding the bulky chargers that are used traditionally.  I use them on my kids toys and there’re working great so far.\n",
      "Save my energy These are not any old style type of rechargeable batteries.The main difference is that you can recharge these over and over instead of keep buying and buying more and more batteries.I purchased the same brand even though they were a bit more because I know they work. So much easier to recharge using a USB port rather than trying to find the charger or figuring out if the batteries are rechargeable!\n",
      "Very good rechargeable battery! These are great rechargeable battery!\n",
      "Wonderful very high quality, and it’s very cool to have a led light were installed in a battery! I’m giving five stars for its package as well, it sealed pretty good, and come with a little case for the battery\n",
      "Environmental protection It has good battery life,quicker charging and more convenient,it is very environmentally friendly to reuse , and the product quality is really good.\n",
      "Amazing technology! I never imagined being able to recharge AAA batteries via USB, and then i found these. Charges up pretty fast, and have been holding up really got on my wireless mouse. would definitely buy more to replace on other electronics.\n",
      "Not enough power for camera I have a simple Cannon PowerShot camera. When using these batteries the display constantly tells me that the batteries are dead even after a full charge. I can get about 20 minutes of usage before having to swap them out. Maybe they are good for something else (remote controls and other low energy devices) but not for the purpose for which I purchased them.\n",
      "Stopped working after 2 uses Have only used these twice and they stopped working. The light shows green and that they’re done charging but it won’t work on any of my electronics.\n",
      "Expensive, Horrible longevity. First cell died after a month.\n",
      "Work well but expensive They do charge very fast about 1hr or so. The life seems pretty good just depending what you are using. But even if your using it in a power hungry device they recharge fast so...\n",
      "Constant true 1.5v output Perfect rechargeable battery, supplies constant 1.5v output unlike other 1.2v rechargeables that start out low on a full charge.\n",
      "No good Battery does not last long.\n",
      "Nice 9 volt batteries that are super easy to charge and hold a charge for a long time I bought the 9 volt 2 pack and they are excellent. There is a charge wire that you can charge both batteries at the same time and plug the wire into any USB outlet. There are battery charging indicators on the batteries that will display a red while they are charging. My batteries were completely dead when I received them.. update these batteries only hold a charge for a short time and then go dead. What junk. I guess if you are using 9 volt batteries constantly then they might work but otherwise they don't hold a charge more than a couple of weeks.\n",
      "Pretty impressed so far but incorrectly said it was charged. This set comes with an USB charger that separates into two wires so you can charge both batteries at the same time from one port. It's a nice flat tape like one, instead of the typical round cord. I was pleasantly surprised by that. So I start charging my batteries and probably somewhere around 3 hours later one of the batteries green light finally turns on and I disconnect it although the other is still red/charging. I put it in the flashlight I wanted to use it in but it didn't work... I actually thought the flashlight was broken at first. When the other battery was fully charged I tried that in the flashlight and it did work, so I learned you can't reliably go by the green recharged light. I put the first one back on the charger and it's working fine. This can be a little annoying when you expect the indicator light to be accurate, but that's my only complaint and is easily taken care of by charging longer.\n",
      "Good Battery Great product and it is also very helpful for the environment.  Takes a while to charge, but the charge will last you a long time.  I don't think I will need to buy another 9v Battery for a long time.\n",
      "Work as they should Good batteries at a good price.\n",
      "Battery Last long First time try a rechargeable battery, it is really surprised for me. The battery last longer than regular Durcell battery. and it is easy to charge. For long term, it is better value. Recommend it\n",
      "Money saving products This is my first purchase of usb AAA batteries, as I've been using AA for several months now and they seem to work well as I'm in the testing stage with them now also.\n",
      "Really Good I do recommend this product because it is very easy to use. I got more than I expected when i bought this so if you are on the table on buying this then you should because it is easy to carry around and it works perfectly. The description is all facts and you don’t need to worry about getting a below par product.\n",
      "Nice to have rechargeable 9v because they cost a lot Amazing! 9-volt batteries are pretty expensive as a general rule, so I was happy to find these on Amazon.  I have a couple of things (other than smoke detectors).  I have a microphone and transmitter that both work off of 9v batteries, and I never know when I will be required to use these items.  I've got the batteries charged and ready to go all the time, just in case.  These are great...I love how you can cover the charging port with a switch.  They hold the charge for a long time, I have them charged up and they haven't run out yet.  They are also lighter than the standard 9-volt battery.  Plusses on all sides!\n",
      "Good item Like the design.  I put this in my emergency stores.\n",
      "Looks like Tarzan, hits like Jane Flashlight does not burn as bright when compared with other rechargeable lithium AA’s.\n",
      "???? I received 2 batteries, both with the different charging port\n",
      "good set of rechargeable batteries Charged up as fast as other brands of this type of rechargeable batteries.  Lasted 2 hour or so longer than other brands in a test of continuous discharge in Ultrafire LED flashlights.  Cost was reasonable and in the middle of the range of other brands I have purchased.They seem to auto shut down their output around 1.5v, and allowed me a few minutes more if the batteries were rested for a minute or two.  This was ok for me since in normal usage of these flashlights will periodic.  So, recharge cycles will be farther stretched out over weeks, maybe months.  And I hate the recycle management of alkaline batteries.I highly recommend this brand.\n",
      "The best battery These batteries are a little more durable than ordinary batteries. Now I don't have to buy new batteries every week. This is a great reward! The battery itself seems to be as well made and durable as any high-end brand. Very satisfied with these.\n",
      "As advertised, not for led lights. Just so/so quality, they seem to work about as well as batteries from the dollar store, but not in battery operated lights. They flicker badly in those.  Tend to go downhill pretty fast.\n",
      "Easy to charge, high quality I have always want my AA batteries like these. No longer need a special charger to charge up the batteries. Quality is amazing, and the battery has led light to indicate charging. Thumps up!\n",
      "Nice rechargable batteries with lots of features!! I got these rechargable batteries for my remote control car these work great!! I use to change my alkaline batteries too often and decided to buy rechargable batteries and found these AA batteries. The main reason I got these batteries is I can charge them with USB. And I know exactly  when to disconnected power by looking at the led indicator ring provided right on the battery which is so cool.\n",
      "Buy once Have been waiting for these for decades. Well worth the cost.\n",
      "1 of 4 batteries stopped taking charge One out of the 4 batteries stopped taking charge after 2 weeks of use.\n",
      "Great! It is a good batteries, which can be recharged easily without any hassles. I tried them and it works great. Satisfied shopping! For the sake of our earth, we hope you will choose more environmentally friendly batteries!\n",
      "Very good quality! The storage capacity of this battery is really durable, the duration is great, and it has a rechargeable function. It really takes a long time to really determine the reusability of rechargeable batteries. It is necessary to judge how many times they can be exhausted and recharge And repeat it, but this battery has done a great job so far, they work well, because they are real batteries, have the battery capacity I need, highly recommended.\n",
      "I use these in my blink cams. I bought these because the price of lithium AA batteries is quite expensive and these are supposed to be rechargeable lithium AA replacements. They do work but they don’t have nearly the longevity one would expect. The thing about blink camera battery life is that they say it gives you two years on a set of batteries but realistically you’re lucky to get 2 to 7 days. Now I’ve had that limitation on longevity with the regular batteries and I have it even more so with these. There’s another site that are black and green that are also lithium AA that have a better life span as far as longevity goes. All that taken into consideration it’s still a good thing to have because otherwise you’re buying toss away the same AA batteries at 30+ dollars a 24 pack whereas for a similar amount of money you get for batteries that will be able to be used over and over more than six times probably a few hundred times. Even though they may not last as long as the throwaway set and you have to go around to replace them pretty regularly especially if you have your settings to record almost all the motion with a high sensitivity and a long clip blanks it’s still better to have these in my opinion. They do show up as needing to be To be replaced as soon as their inserted into the blink XT cameras and that kind of gives you a looksee into how they’re going to behave because they really don’t last all that long but it’s either that or throw away batteries every three days at the settings I have mine\n",
      "Really rechargeable battery, good power. Excellent product!!! I’ll buy it again and again.\n",
      "👍 👍\n",
      "Omg. You need it. I am super impressed those bettery. It is my frist time see this kind of bettery. We dont need any charger jist regular USB charger. Amazing. When light green is mean full charger. Red we need to recharge. I am absolutely love it. Super highly recommend\n",
      "A great must-have item! Works great! The 4way charging cord was a great asset!These are quite expensive up front, but if you multiply the cost of nonrechargeable baterries by 1000. It speaks for itself!I love the red and green indicator lights. They look cool at night while charging but also make visual indication easy.I bought these because at times Ive been homeless. I always needed a way to power a flashlight. I combined these batteries with a snall porable solar charger. Now I feel like Im in charge now. Im not dependant on 110 v outlets which are difficult to use due to the amount of time you have to sit at the location which isnt possible most times.See my other reviews to see my must have items for self sufficiency.\n",
      "Worth buying Great investment. Totally worth the money. Very smart purchase. Easy and quick to charge. Longevity of the battery life is good.\n",
      "Good batteries Great idea. It's more up front but it's cheaper in the long run. Thry charge quick\n",
      "I have been sing on my gaming. I have been using on my gaming x box set it is working great. last long. I like it so far.\n",
      "Best rechargeable batteries I bought these batteries for my EDC and duty flashlights. I'm surprised that these are not flying off the shelves. These keep my flashlights nice and bright. Will buy again if needed\n",
      "Works great I got these batteries a while ago and they are still going strong. Very useful in low power devices.Some devices require 1.5v batteries instead of the 1.2v batteries that rechargable batteries usually provide.However these batteries seem to have issues powering one of my devices. However that device seems to be designed for 1.2v batteries unlike most devices that are designed around 1.5v batteries.\n",
      "50% of battery doesn't charge I think I got a lemon. I charged these for hours... The lights remain red. I then change USB port, charge them overnight and 2 of them finally turn green and 2 still remain red.I used a battery indicator to check battery level, 80% charge.Super disappointed...\n",
      "I'd buy a different brand. These batteries won't hold a charge for any amount of ttime.I charged them until they are full, then without even having them in a device, they need to bet plugged in again. To make a long story short, they hardly hold a charge. Maybe I just received some bad batteries.\n",
      "Works as expected Fast recharging, works very well. Too early to review longevity.\n",
      "Old flashlight upgrade... I have a water proof flashlight that I like a lot.I wanted to upgrade it be brighter and last longer on batteries as well.I bought a LED replacement bulb for the incandescent type.The D type battery has two type of USB charging ports which I like.I think the batteries are great considering you get 1.5 volts at 5000 mA out of a lithium Ion.\n",
      "Junk product Junk don't waste $\n",
      "So Far So Good Got 4 of these at Christmas and installed in our electronic front door lock.  After over a month in cold weather, the charge still shows 100% on our battery tester and the lock is faster and acts like a brand new battery is installed every day.  Haven't charged them yet, but will update review if things get worse.  Ordering more for other devices to see how they hold up.  Much better than any other rechargeable battery that we've tried (and we've tried quite a few of the NiMH kind).  Just hoping that the price gets lower on these in time.\n",
      "fast charging 1.5V batteries I'm using them in a universal remote, a digital weather clock and a trimmer. Time will tell how long they last on a charge, but so far so good. I wanted an alternative to NiMH batteries which are not the correct 1.5 voltage and sometimes get discharged to the point where they can't be recharged again. I like that they don't require a custom charger, just a standard USB cable.The only caveat with this type of battery is they don't work well in portable radios because the built-in voltage regulator puts out wide spectrum radio interference which overloads the radio's sensitive tuner. This shouldn't be a problem for most devices, just radios.\n",

      "seller responsive to quality issues The defect-free batteries work as advertised: micro-USB-chargeable; light up red when charging and change to green when fully charged; actually work as a replacement for disposable batteries. The 4-pronged micro USB charger is convenient. I didn't actually verify the voltage or power.I ordered one 4-pack of AAs, and 1 of the batteries was defective: partial corrosion on the outside, and it wouldn't charge. I contacted the seller, and they quickly sent a new 4-pack of AAs. Unfortunately, this, too, included a partially defective battery. I again contacted seller and they assured me they would be reviewing their quality assurance procedures.So, I can't give this product 5 stars, but the seller was responsive to the defective batteries, and in the end I got 50% more than what I ordered, so hard to complain too much.\n",

      "So far  so good I bought (2) four packs of the AA size and I am very happy with them.  They working much better than alkaline or NiMH rechargables in my toothbrush and in my trail camera.  I have only gone thru the first charge so far, but they have lasted as 50% longer in the trail camera than alkalines and my model will not work with the lower voltage of NiMH batteries.  My  toothbrush has been going with no loss in power  the same length of time as a normal battery shows that it is getting weak.  I would buy again.\n",
      "too much recharging needed purchased this to operate a small fan for hurricanes and off grid use.  have to recharge batteries every morning. too time consuming.\n",
      "The rechargeable battery is very convenient. I like this AA batteries. The rechargeable battery is very convenient and the design is so creative that it can be plugged directly into the battery for charging.\n",
      "Don’t last very long. Didn’t last as long as I had hoped. Was using in my headlamp. Hoped it would last 2 nights, went dead after the first. Bummer.\n",
      "4×AAA Used for small flashlight to deliver food at night, work so well!  Most important thing is to protect the environment, hope to reduce the price and use this kind of products in large quantities.\n",
      "Great rechargeable batteries Like that I have more options to charge.\n",
      "Not worth it Great batteries until I tried to plug them in to recharge and the USB port pushed into the battery body, making it useless. A shame these are $30 for four and they're so cheaply made.\n",
      "Make sure all 4 work I like how two appear just fine for my purpose (wmr controllers) but two are not working or if they do, very briefly, included cable is awesome though\n",
      "The future of battery This is truly a revolution of battery, a whole new experience. I had never used a USB rechargeable battery before. Now I can rid of those disposable batteries. It feels good to do something for the environment and meanwhile save money.\n",
      "450 mAh, is very low. The capacity of these batteries is very poor.At 450 mAh they run my flashlight for 20 minutes, while standard aaa's generally last 2-2.5 hours.The constant voltage is nice, but the capacity is severely lacking.\n",
      "USB charges individual batteries. Long lasting charge. These are great long lasting batteries. Love the USB charger on each battery.\n",

      "Great product for price! Good product, works as advertised.\n",
      "Best rechargeable batteries I've owned These rechargeable batteries are amazing. At first, I was worried about the charging system. After using it for a couple of times, I love how it is able to charge with the USB cable. It saves a lot of space. I wish there was a spot in the battery case for the cable, but it's small enough to where I can just put the cables in my pocket.I only used this on my wireless lavalier microphones. I wanted to see how long the charge will last so I left it on for 6 hours the first day and then 8 hours the second day. The battery meter on my microphones stayed full both days. I am very pleased with this purchase. It lasts just as long as my Duracell non-rechargebles, and longer than other generic non-rechargeables. Will be getting more.\n",
      "Disappointing. I sent them back. Even though they were charged when i put them into a flashlight the flashlight was much dimmer than with regular batteries. I so wanted them to work but not good experience. The seller was cooperative and gets 5 stars. .\n",
      "Light Weight for Charger Less This rechargeable batteries can be charged by a 4 in 1 USB cord that it is light weight and save the space when you travel. The cord comes with the package. Of course it can be charged with a charger too. Every battery has an indicator light, The light is red when charging and will change green when it is full, Very convenient.\n",
      "Would never buy again The charge last till you take them off the charger. I got taken on this purchase!!\n",
      "Better than disposable batteries Only have to replace them in my Logitech G602 every couple months or so.  However, for my Xbox One Bluetooth controller, they are averaging about 10-15 hours of use per charge.  I bought two sets of them so I could continually have a charged set and a set in use and I couldn't be happier with it.  They charge from empty to full using my fast charging USB port in about ~45 minutes.\n",
      "Perfect  alternative to conventional batteries These charge quickly and are a great alternative  to use in electronics which take AAA batteries. I put this in a vibrator  that eats through Duracell battery extremely quickly. They offered more power and lasted longer on a single charge!Its also nice that the cable will charge  all 4 batteries  at once.\n",
      "They work like the advertisment said. The charging port has a dust cover.\n",
      "Good item Good product but a little pricey.\n",
      "Could last longer Was going to return, not enough longevity\n",
      "Interesting idea, probably good for some things... Got these to evaluate for different uses...things that come to mind are my Amazon Fire remote which seems to eat batteries even if I don't use it.First thing -- when you charge them you have to remove the batteries from the device because letting the ends touch (including the series contacts in the devices) will short them out with the charger cable connected.They do charge in about the expected time, and they perform surprisingly well even at very high current draw for AAA cells.  I used an OPUS battery tester-charger in discharge-mode to measure the capacity and the AAA cells came out fairly consistent whether I drained them at 200mA rate or 500mA rate - very impressive maintaining 1.4V right up til the last moment even at the high discharge rate.  I could see this being useful in toys or camera flashes that may go hard on batteries and run out quickly.  Unfortunately the self-discharge (likely because of internal regulator circuitry) makes them less ideal choice for low draw devices like thermometers that could go for years on a normal set of disposable cells.AAA Capacity Measurements: 358mAh, 401mAh, 370mAh, 355mAhAfter sitting on the shelf (in their case) for 4 months, I tested 2 of them again without charging.4-month Capacity Measurements: 355->80mAh, 370->95mAhThis suggests that 2/3 of the capacity was \"drained\" while it was sitting unused, so they would definitely need recharging regularly if you want to let them sit.\n",
      "Buy them, they’re awesome. Freaking phenomenal batteries. Charged when they first arrived, but I plugged them in to get the initial charge as one should do with any new rechargeable battery and let them cool before putting them in my flashlights. Amazing!! Will run them to zero power after the first charge to be safe, but these things are AWESOME! Charging cable has already been used for other usb devices. Def think my single AA 650 lumen light is brighter with these and zero issues (amperage isn’t large enough to cause a problem, these should work in anything using AA’s). Just ordered more.\n",
      "Happy with the purchase Works pretty good.  Recharged and ran my AAA devices nicely.  No more discovering dead batteries and no replacements in the house.  I hope to stop purchasing disposable batteries with this product.  I estimate my brake even mark will be in five more battery swaps;  about the middle of next year.\n",
      "lasts one hour in headlamp I have a $20 Engergizer brand headlamp that takes 3 AAA batteries. I use it a lot and go through many batteries so I bought rechargeable ones. Regular aaa batteries last in this headlamp for several hours before fading. These new Li Ion batteries don't even last one hour before crapping out. Recharged and tried 3 times, all with unacceptably poor performance.\n",
      "A Good Battery No warning prior to dischargeDoes not last as long as other brands\n",
      "Perfect for any standard battery replacement. Just about any 1.5v battery powered device. Great for remotes, mice, etc. Often many devices will quit working once the voltage drops and these don't do that.They at NOT equivalent. Different technology. But they are designed to be plug in replacements and will work as good or better than regular batteries or alkalines.The only exception I can think of is really high current devices with really big motors. Think of devices where alkalines will only last 15 minutes of use. In those cases you should be using a different battery technology anyway.That's the review. Single battery, or 10 batteries in a device. These will work.Background. The reason they work so well is that they have built in protection. Current limiting. Voltage limiting. Voltage and current boosting. And balancing. LiOn batteries actually run at 3.7 volts. Ish. These batteries convert that power to 1.5 volts. When charging they do the opposite only with the correct variable current and voltage the battery needs.And this is the important thing to remember. Because there is a circuit in the middle, there are limits to what it can do. By design. To protect you and the battery from stupid.They don't over charge. They don't let you run them down to where they will break. They just shut off. They also don't let you take more power out (think amps) than they can safely give. It is always bettter to shut down a device or battery then to let you burn your house down.Always.\n",
      "Easy use, fast recharge Really fast shipping.bought this to replace my old tv remote. This batteries come with a 4 in 1 USB cable so you can charge all 4 from one USB port and also a lil carrying case for all four batteries.It thought it looked cool and convenient as it doesn't need a separate special charger unit. I love this USB rechargeable batteries. They are lightweight, and fast recharge.\n",
      "Super convenient These are superb for battery-hungry devices in constant use - I was tired of replacing AAs constantly, and now I always have a charged set on hand. They last well, and are well on their way to paying for themselves.\n",
      "Bought these for my out door cameras. Long lasting Nothing bad to say about this product.\n",
      "Great Product So far so good. Seem to take a good charge and not issues so far!\n",
      "Nice So far so great.  This things really work well.\n",
      "Almost great I used this for a camping hanging light that was also a fan. They lasted for a fee days on a single charge but that was all because when I went to re charge them one broke they have this push in and turn lock that you have to open to get to the charging port well first time I opened it it just popped open smd all the springs and components that make it have this feature came out good idea but didnt put enough into the design.\n",
      "Pricey but great! I’ve had them for a light in my camping gear. Used it for about 8 hours and they are still charged. A little pricy but very happy with them.\n",
      "Maintains 1.5V+ until depleted. I purchased the 4 pack of the AA lithium USB rechargeable batteries. Normally, when I need rechargeable AAs, I buy Eneloops; however, I have a thermostat that is very sensitive to low voltage. When I use the NiMH rechargeables in the thermostat, the \"replace batteries\" warning begins to flash and the backlight won't work because the voltage per cell is only 1.2 V even though they are fully charged. These lithium rechargeables maintain 1.5V until they are fully depleted and the thermostat no longer has the replace batteries warning. If you have a voltage sensitive device and want to use a rechargeable battery, these are a good solution.  The micro USB port for recharging is handy as well. I cycled all 4 cells and at a 100mA discharge rate, they all delivered a little over the rated 1500 mA/h capacity.  Just remember, with these cells, there will be no fade as they discharge, the device will maintain 1.5V and immediately go out once depleted.\n",
      "Charge without removing battery is nice. I have several atomic clocks which are a pita to reset all the functions and get working again after batteries are changed.  These can be recharged without removal, plus the voltage is more consistent at 1.5V.  Just a quick recharge every 6 months or so saves lots of aggravation.  Also thought these, being lithium, might work better than alkaline in the outdoor temp. sensors in cold weather but not so.  Every cool morning the temp. reads dashes so had to switch back.  These appear to be good for warm temps. only.  That's fine, I have use for them inside.\n",
      "Great For Hi-Tech Devices This product is great! It uses a micro USB charger and works as well as my energized rechargeables.\n",
      "Good batteries I have been using two of the batteries for about a month now. I have them in a blink x2 camera, and so far I have not had any issues with the batteries. The batteries charge quickly and seem to last I have only charged the batteries in my camera once (the initial charge). I would recommend these batteries to anyone looking for rechargeable batteries.  I also talked to costumer service about a battery I thought was bad and they immediately fixed the issue and were very helpful.\n",

      "Absolutely Brilliant! I must have been living under a rock because I didn't even know you could get batteries that plugged in like this!  I ordered on Sat and they arrived today (Mon) - they charged within a very short time from my tablet and worked brilliantly in my kitchen scale.  ❤️ It!\n",
      "More scam batteries These batteries are a total scam. Chinese companies are making functional batteries and WAY over claiming their capacity. These barely lit an LED flashlight. They are so light they couldn't be more than 500mah not 5000!\n",
      "Easy to use, get good life out of them I liked the idea of USB rechargeable batteries and was excited to try these out.Charging them is as easy as plugging them into a microUSB cable (included) and letting them charge.The they are ready to go, They are running well in my favorite flashlight I use around the shop that uses 2 D batteries.they have a lot of life in them on a full charge, which is not always the case with rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "A great idea for rechargeable batteries. Easy to set up and use.  Great option instead of throwing away batteries all the time.  No bulky charger, just plug in the cord to any USB charger and away you go.  Keep the plastic shipping container and you have simple storage space for the batteries while they charge.\n",

      "1 of 4 batteries failed in just over 30 day return window Bought as 4 pack just over 30 days ago. Now one of the batteries no longer lights up when charging nor charges for longer than 5 seconds. The defective battery shows as 0 volts on tester. Had these batteries in a weather station sensor for 18 days as a test. On day 18 the sensor no longer sent any data. Weather was fair with temps from 50 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.Looked up fuvaly on Google and found their website. Tried to contact company but there about us and contact us links only point back to the main page. Going to see what Amazon can do now.\n",

      "Great replacement AA batteries for constant use electronics.  AAA have a quirk. Had these 4 AA Lithium Ion Rechargeable Batteries with Built in Charger and charging cable for a few days and so far they have worked perfectly,  They charged quickly and the y look like a string of red and green LEDs when they are all attached to the charging cable, which looked cool and clearly indicated their charging state.  Fully Charged, they worked great in a low draw TV remote control.  They are also working great in a Remote Control Car which does not use battery packs; using constantly for over 1/2 hour with no slow down in speed.Also ordered the AAA rechargeable batteries and they worked over 12 hrs constantly on a stick on flashlight.  Recharged quickly, then put them in a remote control car, although the car would not run smoothly when it hit a incline.  It could be the car, but my suspicion is when the motors struggle to turn, they use less power, similar to when a vacuum cleaner speeds up when you block the air flow.  The batteries sense the drop in current and lower the voltage, which causes the car to stop and start, until it is on level ground, then it works normally.\n",

      "More wasteful than disposable batteries Mine wouldn't hold a charge after the first use. By the time I realized they were defective and decided to return them, the window had closed.Buying these batteries was significantly more wasteful than buying disposable batteries because: - They cost more - I only got 1 use out of them - They provided fewer milliamp hours - They were made from more complicated parts that are harder to recycleI'm going to try rechargeable batteries again, but not these.\n",

      "Capacity Test and Technical Review Fuvaly 1.5v Lithium AA 4x Rechargeable Batteries SummaryPros:* Lights are helpful* Very lightweight* 1.6v unloaded output voltage is great; 1.55v or higher, consistent and based on load* Stays coolCons:* Tested when new to 82.5% of stated capacity (1.857 Wh instead of 2.25 Wh), a little low but in the expected range* Almost no warning when out of power. Cannot be used in critical devices where power cannot be lost.* More expensive than 1.2v NiMHBackgroundMy intended use for these is for wireless Xbox controllers (2 AA) and wireless Oculus touch controllers (1 AA).I have been using high capacity rechargeable NMHi 1.2v AA batteries for a couple years in the XBox controllers. I've tried two models, a 2800mah kind and 2500 mah turnigy brand, marked as low self-discharge.I tested the capacity of these NmHi batteries which were good, however my xbox never showed a full battery, even when freshly recharged, and it would warn for some time that the battery was low. It was good to get the warning and have more use before having to swap them (days of use), but I felt I never got enough life out of these batteries. The 2500 mah Turnigy brand seemed to last longer than the larger capacity ones because they seemed to hold a high voltage. In the oculus it was the same, where some fresh batteries were immediately detected as low.It is true that alkaline batteries start at 1.5v but quickly drop voltage and spend more of their life at 1.3v and 1.2v, and that is why rechargeables match that voltage, but I wanted to try a battery that sustained a higher voltage and see if they provided more \"usable\" power.I chose these Fuvaly because they were the ONLY AA Lithium on amazon who posted details such as discharge rates. I saw these are not a good fit for high discharge rate devices such as camera flashes and some toys like RC vehicles. Having an indicator light and a charge port are superior to batteries where one must remove and replace batteries to reset them and there is no indicator that says what the battery is doing (on or off or charging).Capacity TestI performed a discharge test on standard 4 button charger of a single cell using 0.4a discharge rate, which should last two or three hours. I was happy to see the voltage was a high and consistent based on load for the duration of the test. 1.56v for 0.4a. After it shut off, I let it settle a little and tried to get more out but there was nothing left.I got a total 1.857 Wh of energy out. This is 82.5% of the reported 2.25 Wh capacity. Instead of the reported 1500 mah at 1.5v, I got 1238 mah.This is an expected result due to efficiency loss of the step down conversion, and use of cheap components. I did expect a little better efficiency because the battery must have a 3.7v nominal voltage and output requires only a step down (not a boost converter). Also I did not feel any heat during discharge; that means little loss to heat and it is likely the underlying battery capacity less than 2.25 Wh.I did not test the maximum discharge rate.The good news is the unloaded voltage targets 1.6v, not 1.5v; the voltage dips relative to the load and stays consistent. This means under load the voltage is well above 1.5v. Providing power at a high voltage helps with efficiency.When power runs out on a single cell, the voltage drops to about 1.2v for only 10 seconds or so before completely shutting off. This means electronics get almost no warning when they are out of battery, and the battery and the device will shut off with almost no warning compared to 1.2v NmHi rechargeables. This is compounded when using two or more of these in the same device; the device will be shut off when any one battery is drained. Do not use these batteries in critical devices such as a transmitter for radio controlled aircraft; they will shut off without warning.Charges at 0.36a at 5v, or 1.8 Watts.I did not open the cell but I suspect it is a 1S 600mah Lithium ion polymer battery.  These typically discharge at 5% a month and have a charge shelf life of 300 days.For the best care, do not leave the batteries at a low state; charge them immediately if drained. For slightly longer life, if you are storing them, they are better stored at 35% to 55% capacity or so (50%), not at a full charge. However if you charge them, they will lose 5% a month so it's a good compromise between being ready and storage voltage.Do not charge lithium batteries unattended; use a fire-safe surface such as granite counter top or cement floor; if they become very hot to the touch during charging or discharging, remove them. Recycle them at batteries plus or other store.I will revise my review after more use in devices.Recommendations:* To those who designed and created this: thank you for sharing detailed specifications. Thank you for the lights and physical design and on off behavior.* More capacity would always be welcomed.* These batteries would be perfect if you changed the circuit programming to provide a longer warning voltage time period when the battery is nearly drained. -- Especially under lower loads, there should be 5 or 10 minutes of warning, say at 1.22v. Under moderate loads, there should be a minimum 2 minute warning low voltage. I would prefer this to be longer so that as the battery ages, and gets worse, the warning system would still be ample. This would make the battery more usable as it ages, even as the capacity shrinks.\n",
      "cant go wrong with this purchase A litle worried about the type c connecters longevity as I am with anything that uses the same connecter. great buy and definitely recommend\n",
      "Great idea for new generation lithium batteries. These seem to be excellent battery designs.Best idea yet for rechargeable lithium. I'm using them in my multimeter and tire guage.However my 1st pack includes 1 dead battery out of 3.Going to ask vendor for 1 good battery to be sent out.Vendor sent me entire new package. Not just one battery. Is all good need 8 total.I shipped back single bad battery. Hopes to replace the one on 1st 4 pack.\n",
      "Battery Life The batteries are basically OK.  I have been using them in a small GPS unit.  Unfortunately their charge does not last very long.  I expected them to perform better than they have done.\n",
      "Broken before i can even use it.  Bad first impression. So got the batteries and went to connect them to usb to charge. The blue piece popped off one.  I can't get it to stay on.  The same device also won't charge on usb-b.  The only saving grace is that the USB-C connector does work.  I will be returning the batteries for a replacement (i still like the idea) and see how it goes then update my review\n",
      "Great batteries for the most part The first 4 pack of AAA's I ordered had a single defective battery that refused to hold a charge. (it would go flat within 12 hours of charging even if not put into anything.)However after contacting Amazon and returning the defective product I got a replacement pack in under 48 hours which worked without issue.They're super fast to charge (usually just a little under an hour) and give full power right up until the last moment, making them great for RC vehicles, flashlights, and other devices where full output for the duration of battery life is desired.They're a little pricey, but out perform basic alkaline rechargeables by a huge margin. (About 4x the duration?) So are well worth investing in for a high drain item.\n",
      "1.5 volt nice idea very good,but they don't say what the other charge port fits, if you already have charge cable for your cell phone,I have a samsung phone, if you have one that is 5 volts and it fits, your ok.\n",
      "2 charging ports. Hi, This is a great battery, just a note, there are TWO charging ports on each battery of different sizes. For those of us who do not read the instructions, heads up. The supplied cabels only work with the one size port.\n",
      "Insufficient power for my application (D batteries) Did not pay attention at the power rating when I made the purchase.  6000 mAh is more typical for a C battery than a D.  These did not have enough \"juice\" to replace the non-rechargeable batteries I was using.I purchased these because of convenience since they do  not need a separate charger.  However, the tops with the charging ports had a tendency to pop out and I found it difficult to get them back down into the battery.  One of the charging ports got bent when I tried to push them back in which made it impossible to recharge so I returned them.With all the favorable ratings, it looks like others have had better luck than me, but most of those ratings are for the AA batteries.\n",
      "They're ok They are ok at most, I like the novelty of charging with micro USB, makes it very convenient. But they don't last too long and sometimes get stuck in my controller.\n",
      "Not enough mAh capacity These died in my flashlight after only about an hour. There's about a 1000 mAh capacity in a normal lead cell battery. These have 450. I should have done my homework before ordering. Theres similar usb rechargable liOn batteries on amazon with more mah capacity for the same price. I quickly found ones that were about 650. These do make my light very bright when charged, however. 2 stars, not a good value as there is better ones out there for same price. I thought this seemed like a good reliable company though. These would be better for remotes and very low draw devices.\n",
      "Would not order again Batteries came uncharged and 2 were defective.Also when charging, there was a bubbling/hissing noise coming from one of the batteries.\n",
      "nice product Long lasting charge in most items that i have used them in. A tooth brush has been used multiple time daily four over 2 months without a recharge. Great price compared to other like batteries. I have purchased these batteries again.\n",
      "Happy purchase Have been using almost 1 month and I am satisfied with the performance either longevity or the  ease to use. I use them for my wireless microphone and they last almost twice of the time. Will buy more for my Blink cameras.\n",
      "Good value, high capacity These come ready charged an work well in my solar lights. They had much higher storage capacity than the batteries they replaced\n",
      "Initial impression is Very Good Have had these for a few weeks now.  I am using them to power a drone controller.  They are lasting a LONG TIME compared to single use alkaline or normal rechargeable batteries.What is really nice, they are still putting out the full 5v (they haven't shown any fade as time goes by).\n",
      "Perfect for Steripen Aqua Bought these for my steripen for backpacking. They are much lighter than regular batteries and  my solar powered USB charger keeps these topped off. No more packing extra batteries so I can have water.  Very happy\n",
      "Last longer recommended I usEd for remote control\n",
      "Great battery Very pleased with these batteries,,,Have plenty of current and voltage....\n",
      "Good value We have quite a few things that take batteries.  These are nice to have. They last long time between charging.  They help me save money.\n",
      "A must have If you have children then you know how much money you spend on batteries!!! These rechargeable batteries are so nice! They charge quickly and hold there charge for a long time too. I have these in AA and AAA and they are saving me so much money!\n",
      "Q si cumplen con la entrega Buen producto\n",
      "save money The charged battery solves the problem of expensive battery purchase, so you don't have to buy a battery to save money.\n",
      "Easy charge Love that these batteries have Micro USB connects for charging . The charge regulation is built into the battery itself so any Android cable can be used to charge but the included four-headed Medusa charger is great to have for multiple batteries that are needed for one device. I have a mouse addiction problem and these batteries are perfect. Fairly fast charge and good runtime.\n",
      "Well worth the initial cost. These will pay for themselves in NO TIME.  We go through batteries like crazy, so rechargables are a must. These charge quickly... Under two hours, and you can use the USB cable or a regular rechargable battery charger to charge them up. They have a long battery life when charged, and can be recharged 1000 times.\n",
      "These are amazing I gotta say that these batteries really help a lot with video game controllers. The only controller you should avoid putting these in are the Steam Controllers because they will be hard to take out of them. Believe me, I tried them myself with my Steam controller and it put a little scratch and label damage on two of them. Other than that, these are great. Just avoid using them in your Steam controller if you have one.\n",
      "Excellent, convenient, but size a hair too long This review is for Fuvaly Poly-Lithium AAA 1.5V battery pack (4xAAA). Color of battery is white with blue label.Summary: Mostly positive except 2 minor cons.Con first.1. The AAA battery length is 0.5mm to 1mm too long.It nearly doesn't fit my PIR night light. If you slant the AAA, completely, to slide in, won't do. My way, very snug fit: Slant just enough to compress the negative connector spring. Hold the compression then push down on the positive side. Other method: Thin out the plastic plates on ends of the battery compartment, especially the negative spring connector side.2. You can buy about 64 premium alkaline AAA for its price. That is a lot of alkaline batteries. The good is environmental: less waste: 64xAAA garbage!3. Because of built-in switching regulator circuit, it is electrically noisier than alkaline battery. Try it out on your audio and other devices. It may not have ill effect. The device may have good filter circuit.Pro:1. 1.5V constant until 'empty'!  (99+% of others, Voltage will fall.)It has buck (step-down) switching regulator in it (from 3.6V to 1.5V, regulated).Most alkaline types, 1.5V falls to 1V when in use. So the Watt-hour is much less impressive as claimed in terms of Ampere-hour. Watt-hour= IxVxTime, or IxIxRxTime, where the load is a constant resistor.On some applications, 1.2V is the low limit. If NiCd, NMH are used here, full charge 1.26V will easily reach 1.2V fast.  The claimed Ampere-hour is 60% or more useless. On some modern devices, like MS mouse, the limit is 1V. (I measured it.) It is a better application for NMH battery types. But falling from 1.26V to 1V is still too fast. So, alkaline AAA 'lasts' at least 50% longer than NMH, even if same Ampere-hour rating.2. Include hydra charge cable (1-to-4 micro-USB cable)3. Inside the AAA is also charge-control/protection circuit. Can safely charge with ubiquitous micro-USB 5V cellphone charger.4. Max discharge current limits to 1A by electronic circuit, for longevity of its poly-Lithium battery.\n",
      "First Impression Just received these batteries, so this is only an initial review. i will do an update in a couple of months.I bought these due to a high rating; came in a 4-pack (my flash takes four); are lithium; came with a charging cable to handle all four batteries at once. My surprise was the plastic container to hold all four. No possibility to short them out by being tossed into the camera bag. Sweet!Plugging the charging cable into the battery is simple. Hold the battery in the left hand with the socket facing the right hand. Take the cable connector, metal shield seam side up, and plug in the connector. Plug the USB into the charger. The top of the battery will turn red. That is all it takes.I will return and update the rating after using them for a few months.\n",
      "Awesome Batteries! These batteries are so cool! They work really well and have individual charging outlets on each and every battery. So neat! No need to carry an additional battery charger to charge them. However each battery needs to be charged one by one but it's worth it to be able to have batteries on the go that you can use over and over again.\n",
      "Future of batteries ╔ ■ Price Point / Value: 4.5/5╠ ■ Quality: 5/5╠ ■ Recommendation: 5/5╠ ☼ Overall: 5/5╠ ►Product Need:  USB lithium rechargeable batteries╠ ►Product Pros: Easy to charge 2 ways, 1500mAh size, LED indicator, guarantee╠ ►Considerations:  Per unit price, 4 cords╠ ►My Review: This is an item that is why I didn’t I think of that or see it sooner. I love these rechargeable batteries that help fill in the gap of devices that eat batteries constantly. The best part of this is that you don’t need an extra device to charge them while you have the option to do so if you have one. The price per unit is high, but I think is worth it for getting lithium large capacity batteries that just need your existing cord and can be recharged in a hour and a half while outlasting other battery recharge times. If you have any devices that need lithium batteries this is a great deal. If you are charging all four at once, you will need 4 cords which is kind of annoying though. The battery itself has a LED indicator to tell you when it’s ready. I really can’t think of anything I would change to improve this and plan to buy more in the future. If you need lithium batteries or rechargeable ones I would highly recommend these.\n",
      "Value price It’s better for life, and easy to use\n",
      "Great battery Cancel the little case to keep the batteries and so you don't lose on plug amend individual E which is nice because then I can take to throw in my controller and then ran they die and take the other 2 hold charge great\n",
      "I love rechargeable batteries We go through a lot of batteries at my house so to have a set around that is rechargeable is awesome. I have been using these in a motion detector light I have in my kitchen. I hate the darkness so I got a light that turns on when it senses motion. Only issue is it runs off batteries so I got this set of 4 AA batteries to use in it. When the light gets dim I throw the batteries on charge for a few hours and we are back in business. I love that there is a light indicator that goes around the battery that lights green when charged or red when still charging.\n",
      "Good Wow, this is my first time buying it, really good, worth the price.\n",
      "Charging time is very rapid. Charging time is very rapid. These last a noticeable amount longer. I would say nearly twice as long. I have replaced using disposable alkaline AA batteries with these.And the fact that they can be fed via an ordinary micro-USB cable is a great feature.\n",
      "Don't waste your time with these batteries. The amperage is low and they don't last long and cost too much for their inferiority. IF you are looking for Alkaline replacements these work dramatically better:AmpTorrent USB Rechargeable AA Batteries Lithium 2960mWh High Capacity, 1.5V Constant Output, 2 Hours Fast Charging Batteries 4 Pack with 4in1 Charging Cable\n",
      "Great set of long lasting rechargeable lithium batteries! I absolutely love the convenience of these long lasting lithium rechargeable batteries. I gave them the power drain test and just couldn't drain their power when giving them a workout in my wireless PC gaming controller over the course of the weekend and also using a flashlight left on for 12 plus hours. The look and feel of these batteries is quality. The batteries also came with a charging base that can handle 4 at a time. Very handy and quick to charge. These batteries will primarily be used in my wifi thermostat and being lithium we should see close to a year without needing to recharge. Looking forward to long lasting power and the feeling of being greener (renewable energy!\n",
      "Works as advertised at capacity advertised. Works as advertised at capacity advertised, tested so far at 5 recharge cycles. Works in parallel and serial modes. Good buy!\n",
      "Good customer service The first set I received was defective as they cannot hold up a full charge. I contact customer service and they sent me a replacement instantly. The replacement works well.There are two way of charging them. One is using the magnetic cable the other is using the charger. A full charge takes about two hours and have same or longer battery life than normal batteries. Also they are more environmental friendly as you have less harmful waste.The cable and charger are designed only for these batteries so if you loose them the batteries are useless unless you purchase extra charger. It will be much better if they can be charged by universal charging cables like USB or type C.\n",
      "Two Ways to Charge Recently moved into rechargeable AA batteries for the simple reason that I have so many devices that consume standard AAs and was getting tired of having to dispose of them so often. These rechargeable AAs fit where standard ones will, but I like having the two options for recharging: in a typical hard plastic \"case\" type and the unusual \"octopus\" type, both of which are supplied (and powered by USB, of course). I don't yet know how long these will last in use, but so far they're performing well.\n",
      "Two charging options included... I was pleasantly surprised that they included two charging mechanisms... the standard black 5v case you see in most battery packages, but also the latest craze in rechargeable batteries, the magnetic charging cable! I have reviewed other rechargeable batteries that uses a magnetic cable, and I had mentioned that I suspect these magnetic cables will be universal, and I was right! I took the batteries from the other \"magnetic cable\" package and it hooked up perfectly with the magnetic cable in this package. Keep in mind, the magnetic cable is the thing that is universally designed, not the plethora of rechargeable AA batteries on the market. If the batteries were not designed for magnetic cables, then it's not going to fit. Lastly, when using the black 5v case, it will charge via micro usb cable. Too bad it's not usb-c.\n",
      "Quality high capacity batteries w/ free charger, actual 1.5V I picked these to use in my Xbox controllers paired to my PC downstairs. I had gotten sick of some of my weaker rechargeable only giving a few hours of runtime.... however these batteries really changed the game! It seems that their stated capacities are correct because the controller is going on 15+ hours of battery now and it hasn't started to show low battery yet!I have tons of other NIMH batteries but none of them hold power like this.... I think the difference of 1.5V vs 1.2V (normal rechargeable) makes a difference when it comes to things like controllers (especially older ones).Overall I am really satisfied with them at the moment because my controllers basically just don't die with these batteries in them. I might even get more in the future for other controllers or higher power devices.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!\n",
      "easy to charge and work great; quite expensive I’ve used lots of rechargeable batteries over the years, including NiCad and NiMH batteries.  But this is the first time I have had individual rechargeable lithium batteries in the AA size.  I like to use lithium batteries because they hold a charge a lot better than other types of rechargeables, especially when not in use for a long time.  They also tend not to develop a “memory” when charged frequently.This particular AA rechargeable battery set includes four AA lithium batteries, a 4-battery charger along with a micro-USB cable, and a unique magnetic charging cable that will charge two AA batteries at a time, also by USB.  This set does not come with an AC-USB adapter.While charging, the batteries give off a blue light that turns green when charging is complete.  It took several hours to fully charge them.  Once charged, though, they work great in any device using AA batteries.  The magnetic charger is pretty interesting, although somewhat limited in utility.  It magnetically attaches to the positive end of each battery and charges by USB.  The downside is it can only charge two batteries at a time.Overall, this is a nice set of rechargeable batteries.  It’s an expensive set, but when you consider the cost of AA alkaline batteries these days, it should save a lot of money down the road, especially when used in battery hogs like flashlights and camera flash attachments.\n",
      "Very handy This is a set of 4 AA batteries with a standard charger and a dual-head magnetic charger. The batteries are regular AA sized lithium-ion batteries. The charger holds all 4 batteries and is powered by a USB A to USB micro cable (included). Also included is a USB A to dual-head magnetic charger that fits over the plus ends of the batteries. No plastic carrying case for the batteries is included. The set was made in China.I find this set of batteries very handy. The 4-battery charger works well and is easy to travel with. He dual-head magnetic charging cable is even easier to travel with, but it can only charge 2 batteries at a time. Still, it’s great for carrying in my laptop bag for just-in-case charging. I’ve found these batteries work well in my trail cameras. Overall, this set of rechargeable batteries works well and is quite handy.\n",
      "The best rechargable AA batteries I've ever had What I like:• Very well made – they feel solid.• No plug port on the battery to break, corrode or get water damaged.• Long use on a single charge.• Consistent output from beginning of use until discharge.• The magnetic charger is very fast – less than 2 hours from depleted to full charge.• Impossible to reverse polarity using the magnetic charger – you can hook them up in the dark.• The magnetic charger takes up very little space when not in use.• I was able to charge one or two batteries with the magnetic charger.• I was able to charge a single battery up to all four using the standard charger – pairs not required.• Standard charger can charge any Li-on battery.I am really pleased with these batteries and the magnetic charger - I highly recommend them.\n",
      "Very happy with these batteries! I got these rechargeable batteries for a couple of candles I have that automatically turn on and off. They were eating batteries like crazy and it was costing me a lot of money plus it's a pain to recycle batteries in my area. It states \"Built-in integrated safety circuit protects battery from over discharge/overcharge\".This came with 2 different kinds of chargers and I tried both but I really prefer the one that charges all 4 at once. It has a red light while charging and turns green when fully charged. The description of the batteries claim it takes about an hour to charge, but it took quite a bit longer than that. The other kind is magnetic and it kept attaching to any metal that was around it. Plus the fact I can only charge 2 at a time with that one.\n",
      "it‘s 4x3000 mAh，money worth！ I was intentionally paying for 4 2000mAh rechargeable batteties and it came with 4 3000 mAh batteries with a regular recharger plus an usb speed recharger！the usb cable and 4 extra powerful batteties surprised me. so far i recharged my batteries 6 times and it works well. the batteries are for heavy gaming duty during this stay home period. AND 3000 mAh is working way better then those 1500 mAh. highly recommended.\n",
      "Very happy works great This comes in a small package which is great for storing when not using. I charged these batteries it took a little over 4 hours for all of them to fully charge. The light will stay red until it’s charged and then one at a time will light up green when done. I have certain lighting that requires AA batteries and regular batteries only last a few weeks. When you buy batteries you never know how long they have been sitting on the shelf and how old they are but with these you know your getting a fully charged battery. This package of rechargeable batteries and charger is an excellent deal.\n",
      "Buen producto e innovador Buen producto, estuve buscando por pilas recargables durante algunos días, y estás me llamaron la atención por su forma de carga, las recibí apenas y comprobé su carga y me parecen perfectas, realmente no se cuanto tiempo durarán pero espero que un largo rato.\n",
      "*3000 mAh batteries* Pleasantly surprised that this product has been upgraded to 3000 mAh batteries. Multiple charging options: one to four at a time in any configuration in the included charger base and one or two at a time with the magnetic option. I have not used them long enough to speculate on longevity. Amazon $35.99 cost is a little pricey but over the long haul versus traditional alkaline it shouldn’t take long to recoup the investment.\n",
      "Even better than advertised  So far I've been very impressed by these batteries. Shipping was fast, packaging is good. I tried out both the magnetic charging and the 5V standard charger. The listing says that the magnetic charger will charge in about an hour and a half. The first battery was complete in about an hour and the second right under 1.5 hours. The two I put on the standard charger were done in about 2 hours. The lighting system for the batteries is really easy to understand, although a bit inconsistent; the magnetic charger is blue during charging and green when charged while the standard charger has a red light with flashing blue during charging and a solid green when charged. Still easy to understand though. Haven't had a lot of time to test these batteries out. I have a high powered LED flashlight that burns through batteries pretty quickly and have it on continuously just to see how long they'll last. So far they're going surprisingly long. This set didn't come with the AC plug - would be nice to see that as an option in the past, but I had a multi-USB charge adapter that worked fine with these and probably most people do as well.\n",
      "to date i'm very happy with these batteries,great value! these batteries power my mod for 8+hours and that's with heavy vaping,cost less than buying in store\n",
      "Excellent batteries, I reccomend them to everyone. I like everything about these batteries, charger, and the new type charging cables.  I charged them when I received them, and have not had to recharge any of them yet.  I highly reccomend them to every one.\n",
      "Great set of batteries to have. Long lasting and easy to charge  I got a few sets of these magnetic charging batteries and this one is the neatest as it has the actual block that holds 4 batteries. The charging time is pretty quick and the batteries last quite a while even in gaming remotes. We are very pleased with these.\n",
      "good After receiving the battery, charge it once, but now there is no need to charge it, and the charging speed is relatively fast!good\n",
      "Interesting... I didn't even realize these existed until I ordered them.These high-capacity Li-Ion batteries (if claims are accurate) hold a lot more power than other battery packs I have used. It seems the charging circuitry is actually inside the battery.The battery build quality seems great, and if these live up to all the claims, the batteries are probably a 5-star product - and, in fact, the batteries are a very large part of what you're paying for here.The magnetic charger is pretty slick - just plug it into a USB charger and clip the magnet to the positive end of the battery. (I'm pretty sure this method will ONLY work with these batteries (or clones) as it appears the charge has access to the negative pole here as well, and the LED is built into the battery, not the \"charger\".  Very small and convenient, just limited.The \"standard\" charger is pretty basic and not of great quality. I'm disappointed that it, too, seems to only work with these Li-Ion batteries. I assumed the charger would work with any rechargeables, but nope, they flash an error if you try to charge Nimh batteries. I'm further disappointed that one of the four bays in my charger appears to be broken as it never lights up.So, the batteries get 4-5 starsThe fast, magnetic charger gets 4 stars (would get 5 if it worked with other batteries)The standard charger gets 2 stars because it doesn't work with other batteries and is only 75% working.Overall, about 3.5 stars. I usually round up, but as these batteries are rather expensive, I'm rounding down.\n",
      "They get really hot... After I wrote my initial review of these I bought a second set.  I intended to use this in Vivitar 283 and 285 camera flashes.  These were the workhorse flash for the pro photographer back in the day and they're powerful but also battery hogs.  Initially all looked good so I turned off the flashes and set them aside.  Then I powered them up after sitting for a week or so and the power seemed low so I took them out to recharge them and they were seriously hot to the touch, almost hot enough on the positive end to burn me.Amazon is processing a return and giving me a refund but the man on the phone had poor English skills and couldn't answer my questions if the batteries cannot handle high draw devices.  I put a set of alkaline batteries in after this and the flashes both are working normally.  I think but cannot prove that these batteries are OK in low power draw devices but don't use them in something that normally uses up batteries quickly...\n",
      "Well worth the money Well worth the money. I bought these for something else but they did not fit along with a adapter I bought, but I’m using them for something else now. I will be buying more.\n",
      "At last a true 1.5V AA rechareable batteries These batteries are great.  Ever since I replaced all of my NiMh batteries with pre-charged like Eneloops and Duracells, I haven't seen any batteries that caught my attention until this.  I love the pre-charged batteries, they have a very long shelf life.  The only problem is it is only capable of delivering 1.2V.  Some appliances and toys don't run as effective using 1.2V LSD batteries.  Particularly those with motors, they may run but can be slow and dragging.  These rechargeable Lithium batteries solved that problem.This comes with 2 types of chargers.  A 4-position  charger that plugs into a microUSB cable (included) and a dual USB charging cord.  The only thing I noticed with the later is that it heats up.The only other gripe for now is the initial cost.  Maybe when there's already a lot of manufacturers then the price will stabilize.\n",
      "This here is the new tech in batteries... And I recomend it. PROS;-  The charger tells the status of each battery as it charges.-  The batteries stay charges for longer than the older rechargeable batteries. CONS:-  They take a while to charge... but that's the way it is.\n",
      "Missing charger This product did not come with the charging cable.  Likely returned and resold.  Very disappointed in this product\n",
      "Awesome charger! These batteries are awesome, they came with two chargers, one is the typical style and the other is a magnetic wire that attaches to the battery and plugs into USB.  It works great and I think the magnet charger is turbo charger because it charges quickly. You can charge 4 at a time in the tray charger and 2 at a time with the magnet charger.\n",
      "Handy Batteries - Highly Recommended These Rechargeable AA Batteries 1.5V 2000 mAh are perfect for most home and small business use. We go through a lot of AA batteries in our various electronics, so looking into rechargeable batteries only makes sense.The batteries come with the charger and work well in everything we tried them in. They last a long time when not in use and seem to hold the charge well.Highly Recommended!CFH\n",
      "Essential product, environmental friendly and saves money I no longer need to purchase too many AA batteries on hand (which sometimes get expired/ broken) if I do not use it immediately. With these rechargeable ones, it cancels the need to buy them continuously. Power charging is very fast and efficiently. Also, they can be used for a long time after charging. Highly recommend.\n",
      "I highly recommend this product Before I bought the Rechargeable AA Batteries, I had to keep looking for missing batteries. Now with the Rechargeable AA Batteries, I can charge it and use them for a very long time, and I really like this product.\n",
      "Good . Recycle Environmental protection ♻️ use, I like this very much, it can be reused countless times, with my machine.\n",
      "These batteries will save you money just charge them up and reuse. These batteries will save you money just charge them up and reuse.\n",
      "Very easy to use and charge The batteries are very easy to use and charge. We use the batteries for our remote controls. We have charged the batteries several times and they hold their charge very well. The value was a also an important factor for us when purchasing these batteries.\n",
      "Design and quality Come with nice packing. Very beautiful and elegant design which come with USB port to connect with, no more needed charger to charge, also there are instructions on back of package which is very helpful, definitely worth to purchase!\n",
      "Deteriorated quickly I’ve had these for two months and use them every other day and two of them won’t hold a charge for longer than 30 minutes using an Oculus Quest controller. They used to last about two days before I’d have to charge them and I usually played for 4 hours per day.\n",
      "Good to use, easy to charge When the power of this item isn't enough, it will show in red color, so it is clear.\n",
      "Work great so far... We got these to use in our blink camera's but have not had any Blink camera batteries come up yet. So, we threw them into a couple of solar lights. They have worked well for that.I love the plug is on the battery and i don't have to remove a cover.Also love the cable that come with the batteries. One cable with four ends to charge all the batteries at the same time is awesome. I find my self using it for other items to charge at the same time.Will update once I can insert them in a Blink camera and see how long they last.One last thing I like is the led ring that glows red while charging and green once they are full. No guessing and no screen to read.\n",
      "good for game boys I like them.  They charge quickly and stay charged for quite a while playing a Game Boy\n",
      "They’re awesome. Freaking phenomenal batteries. Charged when they first arrived, but I plugged them in to get the initial charge as one should do with any new rechargeable battery and let them cool before putting them in my flashlights. Amazing!! Will run them to zero power after the first charge to be safe, but these things are AWESOME! Charging cable has already been used for other usb devices. Just ordered more.\n",
      "Great overall value for what it does. A double A battery that is USB rechargeable.  This is a game changer.  Super convenient and last for the expected time as promoted.  Trust me, its worth getting a set.\n",
      "Unbelievable and amazing Wow! I’m really just surprised. When I first bought this item and used it I thought it wouldn’t last long but you could at least charge them. But surprisingly it lasts for a really long amount of time. The amount of time it lasts really surprises me. Usually normal batteries last 2 months or so but these batteries last for a really long time. It’s not so expensive either so I think this is a win win for me. Some chargeable batteries don’t last but this one lasts so long. I’m mind blown and I think this is awesome\n",
      "VERY GOOD I have used rechargeable batteries for many years. I bought these batteries for wireless microphones. When I used them for a few days, I was surprised by the power of these batteries. It lasted longer than the batteries I used before. It can be used for 4-6 hours, while the previous one can only be used for 2-3 hours, and it is worth buying when it is charged.\n",
      "Nice desire and good price What a great USB charging batteries ! I just tested it while i received it. it is easy to charge by any 5V usb charger.  Fully charged in 2 hour. And i like the cute plastic case for the four batteries. Nice desire and good price.\n",
      "Very impressive power I bought a set of AA batteries for my kids’ favorite firetruck toy. I am impressed by the power of this Lithium Ion batteries. My two little boys play their firetruck everyday. I had to replace new batteries for their firetruck every four or five days.  Very impressed that this set of Lithium ion batteries have lasted a week. Probably they can be run another few days. More importantly, they are rechargeable. It takes less than 2 hours to full charge. Thinking to buy another set of batteries for other toys.\n",
      "GREAT PRODUCT! I bought these batteries for my daughter's LED lights and so far they are working great. Normally I would get non-rechargeable batteries but every time they die I would have to look around the house for spare ones or even run to the store to get more and that was very inconvenient. This is my first time buying rechargeable batteries and I'm settled on using them from now on. It's so much more convenient whereas I can recharge them once they're dead. The charging time is also really fast and they last long before having to be charged again. My daughter really likes them and so far they've been working well with her lights. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy batteries.\n",
      "New way rechargeable,last long time It is good ,it can last long time for kids toys,and you don’t need to take changer for it beacause it has usb microB it ease to find it and recharge all of it .new way to rechargeable.\n",
      "What can I say... they work as intended. I love these batteries, they dont last as long as normal batteries (depending on brand) but I have come to love them. Easy to charge too. Weird thing though... cant connect all four batteries and charge them all at the same time, but that's fine.Funny little gimmick. The charging port for the batteries can be closed. Look at pic. I love this. Love it.\n",
      "Longevity is an issue with these They work fine but they don't hold much of a charge. Expect them to last about 1/5 of a normal duracell battery. They are of course better for the environment instead of throwing batteries away constantly. Just know that you will have to charge these often and maybe have a couple charged and ready to go when these die without warning.\n",
      "Default headline Work great. No complaints.\n",
      "One of 12 broke at the USB port I use for items most at risk of an alkaline battery corroding.  Went to plug one in and it snapped.  The USB port had popped off of the circuit board.  Otherwise, these do a great job.  I'm sure the quality will improve over the years.\n",
      "Great Prodcut! I just received for two days and already use it. It last pretty long. I use it for my son's remote control car and my coreless phone. The phone is last for two days now and it still has 60% of it's battery life. I love the design. It limited the charging box. Save a lot spaces.\n",
      "These give full viltage! Finally a long lasting rechargeable that gives full voltage as some don't quite cut it. Some of the torque meters and other test equipment I use wont work at all on a freshly charged regular rechargeable. A bit expensive until you see how well they perform and last.\n",
      "Husband loves them Husband loves them. Use them with his Microsoft VR set.\n",
      "Micro USB rechargeable batteries, what a great idea. Played a lot of video games during the quarantine, ran out of all my batteries for my gaming mouse and Xbox controller.  I wish its USB type C port instead of Micro USB. But still, totally worth the money.\n",
      "Last long easy to charge Great batteries! They have a little twisting mechanism so that you can hide the charging ports. My daughter loves to play with her furby which waste A LOT of batteries. I bought these so I can recharge them myself. She plays with the furby all day everyday and so far hasn’t needed to recharge. They last a long time and are very good.\n",
      "Not good quality I play two rounds of 30 minutes on VR and they are  need to be recharged. After  10 uses, one of the batteries USB port is not working,something has dislodged internally and the charging jack no longer sits firmly in place\n",
      "great Great product - the batteries come with their own built in battery charger via micro USB AND the battery Charge level indicator as well. This means you ONLY charge when they need a charge - and can be charged from almost any USB power supply - like your portable phone charger OR Power brick. If you travel a lot - it is GAME OVER for ever needing to buy ANY battery at ridiculous Airport prices :)\n",
      "The battery is easy to use and quick to charge. Good quality, like this product, USB charging is very convenient, at any time can be charged, with a charger can also be charged. Can Be put in my favorite lantern inside, this kind of battery is very environmental protection, can let me reuse, do not worry about battery pollution. That way, every day I can see the beautiful lights.\n",
      "Great for Windows Mixed Reality Charges a little slow if completely dead. But last a good amount of time. Bought it for my Windows mixed reality and have no problems with them.\n",
      "works as expected These batteries works well. I have a lot of kids toys that require AA batteries and I like to save some money by avoiding buying one-time use batteries. I like usb charging, in which I can use power bank to charge if I am not in the house. The color indication will change from red to green once the batteries are fully charged. It is very easy to use and charge.\n",
      "New rechargeable battery It charges very quickly and has a longer life than traditional batteries. The battery itself has a built-in charge adjustment function. It comes with a charging cable that can handle all four batteries at once, and can be powered by ordinary micro-USB cables.  A very convenient way to charge. I like this new way to charge batteries. It ’s very new and easy to use, and it saves the environment of recycling used batteries.\n",
      "A  Eco-friendly  battery. The set of 4 pieces of AA battery works amazingly. They are regular .5V/1500mAh, I use it every day on everything. This is definitely Eco-friendly, for it has a built-in micro-USB port in the battery body, it can be recharged by just plug in any USB port like laptops, wall outlet, etc. almost anywhere anytime. It only takes about 1.5 hours to get rapidly fully charged. I find out it is very useful for my work and household. Will buy more on all\n",
      "not 100% satisfied with this  brand This brand lasted  as long or longer than other brands I have purchased.  However, one out of the four batteries seem to auto-shutdown as soon as current is drawn from it.  It costed more than the other  brands I purchased.  I can not fully endorse this brand.\n",
      "They don't last very long. These batteries only last about half as long as a standard alkaline battery.\n",
      "Be sure to charge before use. Great batteries that charge fast.\n",
      "I should buy these earlier No more waste batteries! I’m so tired of collecting waste batteries as so many things are using AA batteries, with this rechargeable life saver, I no longer need to worry about when to purchase new ones and where should I keep the used ones. Charging time is quick, really cool design, love this purchase and might get another set of this.\n",
      "What WMR controllers need I got the kids a Windows Mixed Reality set for Christmas. Originally, I tried normal rechargeable batteries in the controllers; they would work for a while but they would show up as \"low battery\" even though they were just fully charged.VR controllers want a full 1.5 volts from the AA batteries. Normal rechargeables only output 1.2. Get these to get rid of the \"low battery\" warning and have longer play-time.\n",
      "Novel and portable product The 4 USB Rechargeable Batteries are very convenient and useful. Rechargeable by lightweight USB cords. When traveling , I would rather take these batteries than a bulky battery charger.\n",
      "Good and very useful They last a long time, but not as long as some of the higher end batteries. That’s no problem though because you can just recharge them anyway quick enough.\n",
      "Great rechargeables. So far the best ones I’ve purchased\n",
      "Batteries run out of charge quick The batteries run out of charge very quick. I put them to charge like the instructions say but they only last one day and the next day I have to charge them again. I don’t think they’re worth the money I pay for them.\n",
      "Great batteries! At first, I thought this was a weird concept. Batteries hanging off a USB cable to charge? Then I got some, just to try them out and it makes so much sense, especially in today's world of USB ports being everywhere! These can literally be charged off of anything with a powered USB port. They're also great for travelling! No bulky charger, just a 4-ended USB cable. Incorporating the charge light into the batteries was ingenious as well!\n",
      "Not all applications I like the ease of charging all at the same time with unique cable provided. It was advertised as Blink compatible but didn’t work in my cameras. Cameras immediately indicated battery low. However they seem to work quite well in my apple keyboard and trackpad so I use them in those devices.\n",
      "Safety, durability, very long lasting, worth the price I use these batteries in my children's toys. They're much more safe compared to using basic batteries considering that the basics tend to explode. These, however, have very little chance of malfunction. Awesome product overall.\n",
      "Excelente calidad Las volvi a comprar por sus excelentes resultados\n",
      "Great for the quest So far I haven't had them die while I've been playing on my quest. The micro USB charging ports are accessable from within the quest controllers so you don't have to remove the battery in order to charge. I actually haven't had a battery for on me yet while playing.\n",
      "Good product They work well and I like where they plug in to be charged\n",
      "Review Haven't used them since charging.\n",
      "Would only charge once I had gotten these in Nov 2019, charged them fully and they lasted a long time, but now this is Feb, and I tried to charge them again and they ( WILL NOT CHARGE ), I watched them for 6 hours and still RED, so I left them in overnight and Still RED what a waste of money.  Very Unhappy\n",
      "Great Value These are great batteries! I use then in the controller of my Samsung Odessey+ VR headset, and they last hours. Other normal batteries last about an hour of usage in my controllers, but after buying these batteries I have only had to recharge them once. I purchased 2 sets, that way if they died mid gaming I could switch out to the other set. I would recommend these to anyone that needs batteries for any high usage device, they will last a long time before needing recharge, and save a ton of money\n",
      "A must have... Great rechargeable batteries. I use them in all my baby toys. Long lasting and no need to keep buying more and throwing away the old ones. Save money and better for our environment.\n",
      "Long battery life Works with my blink cameras long battery life before having to recharge them was not disappointed.\n",
      "Product arrived as promised. Arrived promptly.  Will start using soon.\n",
      "they deliver 1.5v i have a couple of vizio sound bar remotes where in normal Ni-Mh batteries would not work - these one do !\n",
      "Best rechargeable battery Charge these batteries using use cable, like a phone, Bluetooth headphones, and many others device! It is so easy  and convenient! I use these batteries for my Xbox one’s wireless controller and the batteries last way longer than regular aa batteries, for a single charge. Recommended, of course!\n",
      "Works in Nintendo Switch PowerA controllers The PowerA wireless controllers I bought for the Switch take two AA Batteries.  For a while I was using Dollar Store batteries, but after a long gaming session I was replacing them at least once.  So I decided to buy these.  First thing I noticed was I gamed for a good week before they finally died.  The charger plugs directly into one of the USB slots in the Switch and a little red light shows on each battery.  When the light goes green, they're charged.  I didn't notice how long it took because this comes with four batteries, so I just plugged in the other two good ones while the first two were charging and continued gaming.  They work very well, good enough that I'm buying a second set, this time for my cable remotes in the bedroom.\n",
      "I recommend these because of the quality What's nice about these you can charge all for it once they have a very clear light on them when they are fully charged I paid around $20 for them $5 a piece but if you go into the store and check the price of lithium ion rechargeable that's not a bad deal at all besides do you take 1000 charges I love them\n",
      "Rechargeable. So far so good.\n",
      "Es duradero Agradable ....\n",
      "Great products I've started using these USB type batteries in the weather station sending unit by Lacrosse. In the colder weather I could get about 55 days of use with either Duracell or Energizer AA type. These USB batteries are getting less, but too short of time yet to get a good average to compare. However when they go down, change out and recharge! Cost savings are building.\n",
      "Unreliable waste of money I don’t have a high opinion of these, they are very unreliable. I use them in my camera flash. Sometimes I will charge them fully And they will operate normally, allow me to take hundreds of pictures with the flash. Other times they are fully charged, I put them in the flash, and it gives me a low battery alert right away, like they didn’t charge at all even though they were supposedly fully charged. I had never heard of this brand before and tried to save a few bucks, but now I regret it. Go with a more reliable brand.Edit: I originally bought 8 of these, so I can have 4 inside my flash and 4 charging at the same time. Even with all 8 supposedly fully charged right now, the flash has no battery power at all no matter what combination of 4 I put in. These batteries are a completely worthless waste of money. Do yourself a favor and get a more well-known brand.\n",
      "Works Good I got the four AAs for a LED flashlight (two at a time).\n",
      "Good Children's toys now need batteries. I've been looking for a recyclable alternative, and it feels great to buy it.\n",
      "Don't actually work in Blink 2 outdoor cameras like some reviews claim I bought these specifically because some reviewers state these work in their Blink 2 outdoor cameras.  The ones I received do not work in mine.  When you sync the camera with your hub, it will connect and convince the system that all is well, but when you try to live-stream the camera there isn't enough amperage or current supplied to work, so it reports an error.  Otherwise, the batteries are nice, being li and rechargeable in a AA format.  Clever design as well.\n",
      "So far so good So far so good, I expect great but they’re being used in electronic torque wrenches that would eat alkaline batteries for breakfast and ni mh would have to be right off the charger n last less than a day.Only had them for a month, for a aa battery they are expensive but if they perform then they are well worth it, I’m very hopeful! Bought 12 so far and need more soon\n",
      "Ecofriendly rechargeable batteries that last pretty well The idea is great! I have no idea how they manage to put everything in one little battery, but it works! There is even light to show whether the battery is charging (red) or fully charged (green), plus 1 cable can charge all 4 batteries.My baby has all kinda toys that are batteries operated. Rechargeable batteries are more ecofriendly and these work perfectly. These last pretty well for my baby's little piano and seem to last similar to the regular batteries.Would highly recommend these\n",
      "Great batteries These are fantastic I have them in a clock that has  gears that are continuously moving. regular alkaline batteries lasted about three weeks these are going well over a month already on one charge\n",
      "They haven't refined the circuitry enough- devices won't always accept them For those of you that don't know how this works, lithium batteries have a ~3.5 volt nominal charge depending on type and a much greater variance in voltage between charged and discharged states. In order for them to work in place of a 1.5 volt alkaline AA battery, they have to have an onboard voltage regulator to convert the voltage as well as control the USB charging functionality as lithium chemistry needs safety monitoring when charging. This presents several issues. Firstly your device sees the battery at a constant 1.5 volt charge, which makes it think that the batteries are full the entire charge cycle until the onboard converter cuts out on minimum safety (yet another quirk with lithium, they are unsafe to charge ever again if they drop below a minimum safe voltage) and your device goes dead without warning. The second issue is that I am fairly certain the converter goes into a sleep state when it doesn't recognize a load so that it doesn't waste power. This presents an issue for a lot of more intelligent devices that go through a rapid self test when you turn them on. In the case of my old Pentax DSLR it registers that the battery is dead, the indicator flashes and refuses to boot when you turn it on. I have tested all batteries involved with a volt meter, everything registers as a near perfect 1.5 V but their onboard circuitry clashes with the check in my device. The lesson is if you buy these you cannot take for granted that they will work in anything you have. It will actually have very mixed results.\n",
      "Work longer than other batteries on power hungry devices Had them for a couple months last longer than most batteries on Xbox controller since the suck up a lot of power charge quick too\n",
      "Very Happy with These! I always feel so guilty throwing used batteries away. I've been working to use more reusable products. So I thought I would purchase some rechargeable batteries. These are very easy to charge and to know when they are fully charged! I have used them in a TV remote and a motion light that seems to go through batteries a couple times a year. So far they are working great but only time will tell if they continue and are worth the money.\n",
      "Great Charge fast and last long.\n",
      "Save money and recharge These batteries are a big money saver. Batteries can get expensive but all you have to do is plug these in for a little and your good to go. No buying and throwing away more batteries. Less trash for the landfills and more money for my wallet with the rechargeables.\n",
      "Stop Throwing Away $$ Great for flashlights, remotes, wireless keyboards- anything that uses standard, replaceable batteries.\n",
      "Batteries leak I didn’t use these often but I stored them properly in the provided container and I went to use them and they are leaking.\n",
      "Nice batteries I love how they are charged, very simple to do. I haven’t had a chance to use them charged up yet, but will rewrite a review when I do.\n",
      "Works great! I've been using these with my Windows Mixed Reality controllers . They last much longer than regular alkaline batteries.\n",
      "Disapointing Love the idea.  But they are worthless in a flashlight.\n",
      "Charging leds wrong The charging leds say they're fully charged, but when I put them in my controllers, the controllers report low charge. I would not recommend these.\n",
      "You be the judge When I first bought them I was amazed at how it has exactly 1.5 volts.  It's very convenient to charge them too. But it doesn't last any longer than my eneloops.  These batteries were considerably more expensive so I was hoping they would hold their charge a lot longer, but they don't. I suppose if you have equipment that needs exactly 1.5v and you wanted rechargeables then these would be it.\n",
      "Good product Now the development of science and technology is really fast, the battery can be charged with USB, really easy to use, very convenient, thank the motherland, thank science\n",
      "Great Great\n",
      "Safety Great product. Know I know when I need to recharge them and when they are full.\n",
      "Great batteries saving environment Using them for a couple of PC and home appliances + child's toys. Easy to use, sometimes you might even open a mouse cover, stick mini-USB cables, leave it for couple of hours and voila - you're ready to go. Considering how often I had to change batteries for mouse and for children toys, it actually saved me quite some money and wasted one-time batteries. Cannot comment on their capacity or for how long they will last but now everything works fine.\n",
      "Work great! Bought these for some bluetooth controllers for my switch.  They work well and after I had a problem with them, the seller fixed the problem quickly.  Great rechargeable batteries!\n",
      "Works well Great power with built-in power socket for USB. Plug it in the wall with the included cable and you're on your way. Would definitely buy again.\n",
      "Nice Concept Individual cable connectors seem to be Ok but one complete charging makes it easier but this is a nice concept\n",
      "Good quality I always wanted to buy such a rechargeable AA battery, bought a box with a try, I was surprised to find that this is really good, it is a plug of us, very convenient, you can charge all at once.  It also lasts for a long time, which saves money on buying batteries and is environmentally friendly. I really recommend it.\n",
      "Used once and seam split I bought 8 of these a while back. I charged them and tested them out one time and then let them sit in my toolbox for several months while I worked on a different project. I just pulled them out yesterday to use and found that the seam has split on several of them. I don't know what would have caused this if theyare just sitting unused. I'm worried now if I try to use them again.\n",
      "Great for VR They work very well and charge fast\n",
      "Bought these for my wireless mouse... and they seem to last as long as a regular battery (almost 4 weeks). Mine take less then 2  hours to charge.Description says they will last for 1,000 chargers which means I should never have to buy a AA battery again. On the other hand with the cost of these you could buy 100 Amazon Brand \"AA\" batteries and if I only use them for my mouse its going to take about 7 years to break even. :-)\n",
      "Great Idea Wish I had found these earlier  and saved all those throw away alkaline batteries.\n",

      "Easy to charge These rechargeable batteries are quite peculiar. They charge pretty quickly and so far are holding up well to a device that tends to eat through my batteries.The price are so much cheaper than the regular ones. The battery work out as good as the regular ones. It is very special and the wire it came with is so cool.\n",
      "AA So far so good with these batteries. I use in my home security cameras I’m giving a neutral score for value and battery life because I haven’t had long enough to assess there longevity.\n",

      "Malfunctioning battery, right out of the pack! I received these wonderful batteries as a birthday gift last week, i was overjoyed when i opened the pack. With all the devices i run i thought they would be the answer to my expensive battery consumption. I was dissatisfied when i found one of the batteries was not functional, and my little four pack was reduced to three. I give them full marks for being a wonderful idea, but they lose a star, for a defective product and the contact for manufacturer issues was all in a language i cannot speak. :(\n",
      "Better than the rest These work very well and are well made.  I used them for blink cameras and so far. They have no issues. I charged them 1x.  Let’s see how they hold up in winter.  But good so far.\n",
      "Cheaper Cheaper than 400 dollars of alkaline batteries\n",
      "Works well.. Recommended Bought it for my Blink cameras. So far it's been working great. Holds charge well.\n",
      "works well in Samsung Odyssey controllers Someone suggested Lithium batteries for Windows Mixed Reality controllers.  I used these with my Samsung Odyssey's controllers and they seem to work fine.  I like the usb-cable charging option, and how the batteries light up to let you know they're done charging.  Expensive but nice option.\n",

      "Very bad quality look elsewhere The battery’s only last in remote controls nothing but a novelty, if u want quality  buy the envaloop brand. 0/10\n",
      "Convenient, but.. The recharging circuit in these cells appear to interfere with the battery life monitors on some appliances.  I purchased these to fit with a Kestrel 5000 series environment meter, and after the cell illuminates green, indicating a full charge, the Kestrel's internal battery life meter only measures the cell at around 28%.  Granted, the reading appears generally constant, and the meter operates normally, but it is a little disconcerting to see such a low charge reading on a cell that is ostensibly fully charged.\n",

      "Outstanding charge!  Finally a great lithium! Best value all around! I've used several brands of lithium batteries from Duracell to Energizer and this rechargeable lithium is the best value I've ever used.  The charge last much longer and the fact that it is rechargeable makes it even better.  It came in 4 in a package along with a charger.  The battery indicator lights up red while charging and turns green when fully charged.  I know I'll save $$$ down the line with this one. Highly recommended.\n",
      "I love these battery's Now these are great battery's!!!!!  You can charge them in USB port on your computer ,,,or with the battery charger that charges  4 of these at one time,,,,Love it ....If you don't like them use them as Christmas lights, they glow a bright red when charging and a bright green when done....LOL  buy them you will like them,,,I do...HARLAN\n",
      "Full 1.5 Voltage AA Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries These are 4 Rechargeable AA batteries.  They are Lithium Ion so they have a full 1.5V, not 1.2 Volts, like most other AA rechargeable batteries..They have a unique design with a micro-USB port in the side of the battery for recharging with a standard USB cable to any USB port.  They also have a red and green LED to indicate that it is charging and fully charged.❤ LIKES:Pre-chargedFull 1.5VRed and Green indicator lights💔 DISLIKES:Not sure if it can be used with a standard AA charger\n",
      "Not worth the cost. These batteries did not function as I had hoped.  I was recharging them every five days.  Using regular batteries lasted much longer. Not worth the investment\n",
      "Can't go wrong bought these to use with my Oculus CV1 and my Acer WMR contollers. battery life seems good, I charge them once or twice a week depending on how many hours I play.

      "Lasts a long time, charges really fast I use these in my Magellan eXplorist 110 and Canon PowerShot A530. Those two things chew through AA batteries like nothing else. I've been using these for a week, and these new batteries last a lot longer than my Eneloops, let alone alkalines. Not only that, they charge really fast. My Eneloops used to take all night before they were ready. These batteries take an hour and a half, and they're done; I'm using a basic 5W 2.1A charger. And plus I don't need to lug that bulky charger anymore since I can use that USB cable with my phone's charger.The only con is that the batteries' sides are not perfectly smooth, so sometimes they'd get stuck in my camera, and I'd have to rotate and jiggle them before they come out.20190707 (one month) update: first of all, DON'T charge the batteries while they're in your devices (like in my picture). They get really, REALLY hot. The batteries got hot enough to burn my fingers. So take them out and then charge them. They'll still be warm when charging, but they won't be dangerously hot. The batteries still last a long time in the devices that I use them in, but - and maybe it's just my devices - the battery indicators on my devices give false readings with these USB batteries. Like my GPS receiver (Magellan eXplorist 110) will show that the batteries are still fully or mostly charged, even when in reality, they have been used all day and are nearly exhausted. Same digital camera (Canon PowerShot A530). The batteries still last a very long time though. A full charge will give me almost two days with my GPS receiver (NiMH and alkalines give me about a day). It's just hard to gauge how charged the batteries really are with the built-in indicators, so just to be safe I always fully charge them before going out with them.\n",
      "Great for gadgets that report freshly charged NiMH batteries as low When I put in freshly charged Eneloop AA batteries into my Odyssey controllers they only are detected at a good charge for a short period of time.  This is because the Eneloops are 1.2V instead of 1.5V.  These rechargeable lithium batteries correct that issue.Customer service is excellent.  I reported a single battery out of four as not having the led for charging/charged.  They responded within hours and sent the replacements right away.\n",
      "Beats burning through Duracells MY patio umbrella light would go through 4 AAA alkaline batteries in 3 nights (became too dim but still worked), these are a more affordable solution. These last a tad longer than alkaline, and being re-chargeable will end up costing less in the long run. They have charge indicator (red/green) on the side, money well spent.\n",
      "Easy to use and save money I have two children, they have a lot of toys that need batteries. We use a lot of disposable batteries. Now I can save a lot of money by buying this rechargeable battery. This battery is very easy to use and the charging is fast.\n",
      "Easy to charge. Great battery life. Larger thank regilar AAs. Great product. However, these are slightly larger than regular AAs.\n",
      "useful it was great that i dont have to go buy tons of battery, just need to recharge it\n",
      "So useful I bought this use for my son' toy. it is better than I think. My son is so happy. He say it is the best earth day's gift for him.he want to share with classmates.\n",
      "Batteries get real hot Tried using it in a lectrosonic transmitter...  It got too hot to handle and almost burned the actor\n",
      "So So When I installed the battery in a wall clock, even with a fresh charge it would not run the clock. They are the same as less expensive 1.2v  rechargeable batteries. I do not recommend these batteries.\n",
      "Perfect Charge very quickly\n",
      "ehhh, wouldn't buy again I thought the lithium battery's would have long life and I liked the usb charging on the battery, I found the battery life to be substandard and would recommend NMH as a better choice. One last thing they fit tight and sometimes to the point I was afraid to use them for fear of breaking something.\n",
      "Charge quickly... They charge quickly but the charge does not last very long. The batteries only lasted 2 weeks in my security camera before they needed to be charged again.\n",
      "Nice but has a pretty big flaw Update: After deciding, I wanted to return the item, I tried to pull it out of the Logitech Harmony Remote and it won't budge. I tried using tools to get it out but I would end up having to scratch the battery's casing and potentially risk damaging my Logitech Harmony remote as well. All in all, not happy with this product and I would advise to be careful when placing the battery inside your device.Pretty pricey for rechargeable batteries but I guess that is to be expected since it is relatively new. Charges quite fast but the only issue I have with it is that the sizing is a bit off, which makes it hard to put it into a device. I had a hard time forcing it into my Logitech Harmony Remote and into my electronic dart board. I am not quite sure if this experience is limited to my unit but I will wait to decide on whether or not to return it\n",
      "1 out of 4 worked I had one out of four of the batteries failed before I could use it.  What I like about these batteries was that I can recharge them via USB.  It's to bad one turned out to be bad.I don't know that I would recommend these batteries yet.\n",
      "Works with outdoor blink cameras! Its been 2 months and I still don't have to replace the rechargeable batteries. With Energizer lith AA batteries this will last me about 5 months on the same blink camera. I hope these rechargeable's will last at least 3 months and I'd be happy. Remember when you look for these rechargeable lith, be careful some will say 2800mKh which converted is actually 900mAh, advertising trick.This package comes with 4, AA batteries, and 4 in 1 micro usb charger.  Works great right now. i read some where that lith batteries are rated for 1000 cycles before degradation.  so i expect these batteries to slowly start losing it's ability to hold a full charge after a while.\n"

      "Fantastic I use these to power my windows MR controllers.  The constant 1.5v allows the controllers to use more battery charge without low power warning turning off vibrations.  The batteries last a long time and recharge quickly, couldn't be happier.\n",
      "Is not 1.5V What a waste. Does not have 1.5V output. Controller will not turn on with these batteries.\n",
      "Holds a good charge Easy to charge. Seems to last considerably longer than standard alkaline batteries.\n",
      "Liked so much ordered more! I waited a bit to write my review, to make sure they actually work! I’ll update, if anything changes. I have a television remote that eats batteries (a few other things as well). I ordered my first set during Prime Days for a great price. I liked them so well, I purchased another set a couple months later. I purchased the same brand even though they were a bit more because I know they work. I also purchased some AAA, although a different brand. I have been very happy. So much easier to recharge using a USB port rather than trying to find the charger or figuring out if the batteries are rechargeable!\n",
      "slightly bigger than an alkaline AA, but great battery I've tried these batteries in replacement of my NiMH rechargeables. They work really well. Lasts a little longer than those batteries, but doesn't seem to last quite as long as an alkaline or non-rechargeable lithium battery. But for the convenience of having the charger go with you anywhere is awesome. You don't have to carry a separate charger or tons of spare batteries. They charge pretty quickly and seem to maintain their charge in storage as well as any lithium rechargeable battery does. My only complaint is that the form factor is slightly bigger than other AA batteries. I've tried them in a few instances with my video game accessories and it's tough to get them in and out. While other rechargeable batteries and alkalines fit without issue. The difference is mm, but enough and hard to get a picture of. I hope there's a v2 coming that reduces the form factor.\n",
      "A great battery for computer mouse. For some reason my magic mouse always consumes the batteries fast. In order to same some money as well as produce less waste for the planet, I went to these usb charged batteries. They are super convenient. When they are charged, the indicator will turn green, just like charging a phone on the computer. Recommend.\n",
      "one of the best rechargeable battery options for my use cases I've been really impressed with this product.  There are a few very key areas these are better than cells like eneloop.* they are the exact same size as alkaline AAs, most NiMh/NiCd are slightly larger so they get stuck in some devices like maglights and door locks and some remotes.* they last a long time in storage.  NiMh/NiCd are dead after 3 months if you use them or not.  Do you expect your flashlight or remote to work if you haven't used it for awhile?  If you do then these are the way to go.* USB charging.  we all have USB chargers, if you need to charge it you have greater ability to charge it.* voltage sensitive devices that don't work correctly on 1.2V will love these batteries.  analog wall clocks don't keep time on 1.2V!most people don't really understand the nuance of rechargeable batteries, this product is a great example.Some devices don't work well with 1.2V cells (wall clocks for example), the mAh rating depends on the discharge rate.  You can't trust that a battery with 2500mAh rating is better than a 1400mAh rating.  this is even more true when comparing different cell chemistry.The same cell can be claimed to be different capacities if the test discharge rate is lower or higher (lower discharge rates simulates higher capacity)Weight, sure.  that matters sometimes.This one is the biggest for me, self-discharge rate.  This is how much energy is lost to the \"air\" vs being drawn off from the device.  In the case of devices like TV remotes, wall clocks, door locks, flashlights, radios, etc.  the time they are left inactive and loosing charge is very high.  In these cases, a 2500mAh NiMh won't last as long as a 1400mAh LiIon cell because there is more lost to the air in NiMh cells.In situations that you're using all the charge in a short time period (during one day), the NiMh will last longer.you also have to consider that mAh is different than mWh because one technology is 1.2V and one is 1.5V so the amps (A) drawn are less but the watts (w) drawn are the same.\n",
      "Long life I use them in a item that sucks the life out of a battery and they last longer than the alkilines I put in their. I haven’t even recharged them yet!\n",
      "How is the 1500mAh capacity rating determined? These seem like good batteries, but when I put a 10 ohm resister across the battery to produce a 150ma load, it consistently takes around 8.5 hrs to deplete. This equates to around 1300mAh capacity, not 1500. While this is not bad, I would like to know what justifies these being sold as 1500mAh batteries?\n",
      "Best Rechargeable Batteries. These things work great. My Simplehuman dish soap dispenser kept killing all of batteries so I tried these out. These batteries last forever and are super easy to charge and even better, you can charge all four at once.\n",

They are easy to charge, even though I don’t have to charge them often (because they last so long), and the carrying case a super handy. I recommend these batteries to anybody and everybody who could use them!\n",
      "Noisy, Not for Radio or Low Noise Use. Tested one of these loaded at 32mA resistive load. Ripple was at 150mV up near 1MHz.  Deafened an Avalanche receiver when placed nearby - Not even in a device!  I would be happy to use these in a non-critical application.  I have not tried yet tried them in other applications.  USB Mouse top most on my list.  I like the idea that they maintain 1.5V right up until they are discharged - again may impact proper application.\n",
      "Okay for moderate Xbox use - functional but not amazing I bought these primarily for use for use in my Xbox one controllers - the set of four is perfect because I can swap them out in pairs.  Battery life is acceptable, I can get maybe 12 to 16 hours out of it using my elite controller with headphones plugged in.  The big con is that there is no warning when close to depletion, with normal alkaline cells Xbox will tell you \"your batteries are getting low\" - so when they die the controller shuts off instantly and that's about it.The frustrating part is when I plug them into a controlled usb charging station, each cell only takes about 500 mAh before indicating they're full after dying in my controller - so either the voltage regulation circuit drops off too fast to keep powering my controller or the 1500 mAh rating is grossly exaggerated.  Knowing this, I simply swap them out every couple gaming nights and don't have an issue.I do really like the USB rechargability, everyone has USB micro chargers around and it comes with an adapter to charge all 4 at once.When charging I see a peak current of around 500 mA per cell - so for my normal usage it takes an hour to top them back off.  Peak observed temperature during recharge is around 116 F in the end where the charging regulator is.Not a big deal, but the LED's are not very bright, if you're in a sunlit room you'll have to cover them up to see if the charge indicator is red or green - very easy to see in a dark room.A side note if you're picky on this sort of stuff - the text on the side is clearly in need of some proper English translation.The plastic case works very nicely for holding them when not in use.Overall I don't regret the purchase, it met my intended needs - but am curious to see how well they last over time.\n",
      "Great batteries with great battery life! These work great. I have now purchased two sets of these. I use them to power rc transmitters and other tasks. Great battery life as they are a little higher capacity than most of the others available.

To ensure the batteries actually work, I put them in my make up mirror. Wow! I don't believe I have seen the light shine sooo bright before! The first picture is with 2500mAh Nickel Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries, and the second picture is with these batteries. I'm definitely keeping these for other household use.\n",

      "Simple To Use, working great on electronic soor dead bolt lock by kwikset ***Update*** The battwries have been working out GREAT, but make darn sure you align cables to charge. Keypad battery life is about 2 months. So the lithiums are lasting longer than rayovac alkaline cells. Highly recommended!  Still lost a star due to port potwntial damage.  /Update***I have an electronic door lock (keypad) that loves to eat batteries (4xAA), and tired of changing / throwing away batteries every 3-4 weeks.  Tried NiCD and NiMH, but terminal voltage is too low and makes the lock think that batteries are exhausted very quickly.  Lithium AA batteries work pretty well, but cost quite a bit more than alklaline and are not rechargeable.  Found these, and with a regulated 1.5v output, pack should always be a consistent voltage despite last time they were charged.  When the batteries need recharging, can just pop out and plug in.  Easier said than done.  The charge ports require precise alignment with the \"charge cable harness\", I can see that inattention or carelessness can cause the ports to break.  That is only complaint.  Batteries have  been in place for about 2 weeks now, and are showing great potential for this particular use.  I will most likely order several other sets for the other keypad locks, though I am still on the fence about how the charger connects.  Upside to these is that a standard micro-usb is used.  Others have a proprietary charger that contact rings on battery terminal.  At time of this writing, these particular batteries are unavailable, so will have to find an alternate.  Most are less than 800mah, these were rated higher and were biggest reason for purchase.\n",
      "Best rechargeable batteries I love the batteries. They fast charging and looking lasting.\n",
      "great great!\n",
      "Re-use~help the planet Very nice, easy to charge, and comes with cable, help the planet, I consider this is semi green product, can re-use for times, should promote this design; although the one time deal battery can recycle, but this idea is much better; and the one time deal battery can expire.\n",
      "I've wanted a 1.5v AA rechargeable battery for years, decades really! I worked as a Wedding Photographer years ago. I used AA Alkaline batteries in  large quantities. I tried rechargeable AA's, but the voltage is 1.2v so camera flash recharge time was slower. Recently I did a mid-day outdoor wedding as a favor. Start time was noon so harsh shadows were a problem. To lighten shadows I let my big flash unit fill with a bounce attachment for the 5 hours more than 100 flash shots. I knew this event would be a good test AA 1.5v rechargeable Li-on's.  I wore out, but these light weight batteries never had any flash recharge slow down like Alkaline batteries would. After 90 to 120 minutes charging, they were ready to go again.  I'll be back for more TWHARF AA and AAA 1.5v rechargeable Li-on's.\n",
      "Great for wireless mice Lasts longer than any AA I've used before, for mice that use batteries this is a great idea.  Even comes with a crazy single USB to 4*micro USB cable to charge them all at once without wasting ports!\n",
      "Good batteries! The come with a 4 in 1 USB cable so you can charge all 4 from one USB port and also a lil carrying case for all four batteries. The also have an awesome lil LED indicator on each battery that turns from red to green when the battery is charged.It thought it looked cool and convenient as it doesn't need a separate special charger unit. I love this USB rechargeable batteries. They are lightweight, and fast recharge. These batteries are the same price as the NiMH, and they charge so fast, plus the 1000 charge cycles with still a lot of capacity left I will not need to replace these for a while and just by more for the rest of my devices.\n",
      "Great batteries! These are great, no cap to lose unlike others on the market, or have a seal deteriorate over time causing the cap to fall off. Don't quite feel like 1500mAh, more like a good 1300, for how long they've lasted in their first charge cycle, but can't complain at all, way better for the earth than using non-rechargeables and tossing each time they are dead.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY!  DANGEROUS I am changing my review of these batteries.  The second time that I charged them they became VERY HOT within minutes.  This is not supposed to happen as per the manufacturer. One of the batteries did not light up on the second charge.  I used a 110 outlet and my cell phone jack.  As instructed I did not charge them in the little plastic carrying case.  These batteries are wider than a AA and rub in a  flashlight cartridge.  Damaged Lithium batteries are not returnable to Amazon, either.  They are a fire hazard.  Amazon adjusted my account for this product.\n",
      "These work very well Work as expected, they run my police scanner all day, then I just charge them up again. About the same capacity as good premium alkaline battery. Nice to travel with too, as most hotels these days have USB chargers in the room. The LED charge indicators are a nice addition to what is already a very good product.\n",
      "good I really like these rechargeable batteries.  So far, I like them more than conventional rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "Super saving These batteries are best for my son’s toys. Easy to charge it and super long lasting! I will buy more!\n",
      "Awesome little batteries! These little batteries are awesome. The come with a 4 in 1 USB cable so you can charge all 4 from one USB port and also a lil carrying case for all four batteries. No more dealing with a bulky battery charger.The also have an awesome lil LED indicator on each battery that turns from red to green when the battery is charged.The great thing about these Li-ion ones is that they will not discharge if left for a long time like the more common NiMH batteries I had previously - definitely worth the price! I just bought another pack.\n",
      "Great Durable and convenient to charge .saves money and is environmentally friendly\n",
      "The battery is the most energy-saving and environmentally friendly I have ever seen. I saw this battery for the first time. I can’t believe it was too pleasant.\n",
      "Like I really like these rechargeable batteries. I like the fact that you can charge it almost anywhere a usb is available.\n",
      "great product and easy convenient This is pretty cool,  i can usd usb to charge it all at once, very easy and convenient.  love this product, love this design.\n",
      "I'm impressed I haven't used them yet,the way they get charged is awesome👍\n",
      "The add that this seller is advertising is misleading and a total lie. The add that this seller is advertising is misleading and a total lie. The batteries are at a much lower technical performance all the time.\n",
      "very eazy i loved these batteries so much i ended up getting more. so easy to use especially if you have something like an xbox controller that loves to munch batteries like its user does chips.  swap in other pair easy then plug them into the front of console or  a  PC  its so easy to do. only downside i have seen with these batteries is they have about 5% less charge then a  1 time use aa but...  when take into account these can be used multiple times i am more then happy. overall  gotta be the best USB rechargeable's i have seen.\n",
      "Long charges Surprising how long the batteries stay charged!!\n",
      "Better then the rest This is the best design in my opinion. It beats the 4 cord micro usb design by far. The batteries last a full day of non stop Xbox play. And take very little time to charge. Just plug right into a usb port\n",
      "Should have purchased sooner This was the one of the best purchases I have made. They have a long life and are easy to charge. I was a little skeptical at first, so I only purchased 4, but now I am sold. I will be buying more and recommending these to friends and family.They are more economical and land fill friendly. No more big bucks for packs of batteries that you have to wait for battery recycle days to turn in.\n",
      "Weak battery life Terrible battery life, charge do not last. Good for an hour\n",
      "Easy to recharge Beats having a box of charged batteries around.\n",
      "Doesn't hold much charge They don't hold near as much charge as normal batteries, so yes, you can charge them but you're always having to take them out to charge them when you haven't used them that long.\n",
      "Charge They do not keep their charge for a period of two weeks.  Charged them and attempted to use them on my keypad, but found they lost their charge.  Worthless.\n",
      "Convenient Charging These are very conveniently charged with the USB option.\n",
      "The charge does not last as long as regular AAs. Bought these for the novelty of something new and clever. My order arrived - just four batteries in a plastic case - no charger like the others received - $18.93 (Now charging $4 more).  I charged them fully and then put them in the plastic case and gave them to my wife as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.She put them in a walkie talkie but they just lasted a day on standby. I asked her to charge them over night because I had charged them two weeks earlier and maybe they had run down on their own.The walkie only took three AA batteries but she charged all four overnight. I went out to cut wood and just put three AA batteries I got from Harbor Freight (yellow ones) for free in my walkie. We didn't talk too much but did yack a bit.By evening her batteries were almost dead and my walkie still showed some life left. I think that the size/volume of the USB section reduces its ability to hold a charge as compared to a full sized lithium AA. Turns out these batteries are not lithium Ion but Ni-Mh.They are novel but not worth the money in my estimation. I looked on AliExpress and you can buy these for less than $2 a piece. If they had been 1.5v and lithium Ion it would be a good deal.\n",
      "Great product Can be recharged quickly and easily.\n",
      "Good for the money These are great for your money, But are they really worth the extra money? Im asking this question because you can buy normal rechargeable for around the same price if not cheaper with a charger. If your someone that travels a lot and you have a laptop and portable charger then yes these are great, But for the most part it would be cheaper just to get the normal non USB or Micro-USB AA/AAA/9V/D. The life is around the same. If you want to buy these because of the look and the function then buy all means do so. I bought them because I have both USB and normal US outlets.The build quality feels great and does imitate the feeling of normal AAs and does go green when fully charged. I can use a Xbox controller for around 3-4 days and my daughter can play with her toys for a full day. These are a good buy even if you want something to fit that modern life style.\n",
      "Charge does not last Love the concept but charge last about a week compared to months with a traditional charger.\n",
      "Convenient but low power and short battery life I would not recommend using these in devices that need sustained high power like flashlights or electric trimmers since the batteries are a little bit lower Amperage, but they seem to be fine for use in remote and game controllers.\n",
      "i got these for when tshtf/teotwawki I've never had a bad product from this company..\n",
      "Would buy again These work as long as regular batteries. Take about a day to recharge though. But there great!!\n",
      "Frog batteries Very interesting batteries they are working good\n",
      "Good for the environment! Adorable, easy to charge, better for the environment, what else could you ask for? I'm in love! Thank you Survival Frog!\n",
      "Love 'em! Want to buy more!!!!!\n",
      "more convenient than buying traditional batteries These came with a 4 port USB hub with individual toggle buttons and a case to hold them in. Bought them in May, still using them in March. exclusively for Xbox controller. They last about 24 hour s+/_  .  I'm thinking about buying 4 more.\n",
      "Buy batteries and charging pack together. This helps keep down the cost of AA batteries, especially in an emergency. I charged mine with a solar charger and they are working fine.\n",
      "Batteries function as intended but usb adaptor broken Product came with 4 port usb, but only 2 ports work other than than the batteries them self work well as expected not as long lasting as regular battery but fine for intended purpose (headlamp for use at work)\n",
      "Batteries I have used them before and worked great\n",
      "Not good I did not get the four port charger that comes with it.\n",
      "Great Excellent needed these love these batteries 😂life savers!!!!\n",
      "Easypower USB AS Rrechargeable Batteries They are good, they are being used for our grandbabies toys. Respectfully.\n",
      "Awesome concept !  Great product ! Best recharging concept to date.  The batteries hold a charge.  Best yet, you save money by not purchasing countless new batteries.\n",
      "They work, but die really quickly. Got these a month ago. Two of them worked very well, the other two lost charge in a few hours, needing to be recharged. A month later, the two which lasted a few hours last an hour. The two that lasted much longer... Now last maybe 3-4 hours. It's not terrible, but I bought the USB on a whim to try them against my wall-socket charger batteries. And they don't stack up.The wall mount can be \"Pricey\" but buying new rechargeable batteries for them is far better in my opinion. They last longer, and hold a charge for longer.Maybe I got unlucky. But I don't think I will be buying these again.\"Delivered May 20, 2019\"Today is June 22\"Return window closed on Jun 19, 2019\"Interesting isn't it!\n",
      "Love the design on these By making the cap a cover for the USB slot I feel like this is much easier to use than the batteries I've seen that use a USB-mini side port.  With those if the mounting was done improperly, the cable won't either slot properly or stay attached, and in both cases the ones I had didn't charge properly.With these, I can plug them in, leave them overnight, and I'm good to go.  They're great for both my wireless mouse and my Xbox Controller, so I can play anything on my laptop at home, or on the go with no problems.The only reason I don't give them a full 5-star is I wish the batteries would last a little longer, and I would love to see  the material used to keep the cap attached to the main battery to be made of something more durable-seeming.\n",
      "So  convenient Love this product. Can charge these anywhere you have a USB. I will be buying more.\n",
      "A must have for gamers! I keep them in my controllers for all of my game systems as well as my wireless keyboard. They charge quick and stay charged for ages.\n",
      "Very versatile Works as advertised\n",
      "Great battery life and ease of use. Super easy to charge and holds a charge much better than other rechargeables I'ver tried. A longer USB cable would be a plus.\n",
      "Works great Work just like normal AA\n",
      "Easy to use rechargeable batteries. This product is just what I expected. I will most likely buy more.\n",
      "Just inovative I like how you can charge and recharge many times\n",
      "USB rechargeable AA batteries My weather station goes through AA batteries rather quickly, so I thought I'd try some rechargeable one - these look like they'll fill the bill.  I charged them when they arrived and replaced the standard alkaline batteries in the station and I'm waiting to see how long they last.  We've had a couple storm come through but the batteries are still working.  It's been a couple weeks and so far so good.  I can better assess their battery life, value and overall rating once I see how long they last.  One nice feature of the product is that they came with their own 4-port hub for easy charging of all 4 at once.\n",
      "Great batteries! Great batteries! Just wish I waited a little longer to purchase the new lithium version because I use them in the blink cameras\n",
      "Poor quality control Of the 4 batteries I received only 3 actually work as they are supposed to. 1 absolutely will not hold a charge no matter what I use to charge it. For the price paid they all should work.\n",
      "No need to constantly buy batteries! I like the idea that the batteries can be recharged. I started using them by putting one in my mouse. It hasn't failed me yet! Thanks so much!\n",
      "Cool concept Cool concept.  Disappointed that I had to charge them right out of the box. Took approximately an hour. Used them in an xbox controller and they maybe lasted 8 hrs of gameplay.\n",
      "Great Great\n",
      "Why haven't you bought these yet? I am in love with these batteries. I'll probably get a few more packs of these. The charger that is included is really nice, has switches for each slot. \"Should I buy these batteries?\" If you use double A's at all, get them right now.\n",
      "2 out of 4 aint bad, smh. Only 2 of the 4 charging ports worked.\n",
      "Impressive idea. So far these are great. I am using them in my Apple mouse, which goes through batteries alot. So I charge 2 as soon as I take them out, replacing them with the other 2 (already charged. The only concern is the VERY THIN piece of rubber/plastic that holds the AA top on over the USB charging points, but we'll see how they hold up.\n",
      "Be aware that the cord for the charger is on the short side. So far the product is a godsend i thought i didn't need until i saw it. However, there is an issue with the connectivity of one of the battery charge ports. Its only slight and easily adjustable. Otherwise a strong recommendation from me.\n",
      "Saves me lots of money Bought these to replace my endless use of AA batteries. Easily recharged and saves me money in my wireless device.\n",
      "It's only 1.2 V!!! Most AA batteries are 1.5 V and this one is only 1.2 V. As a result, when installed in some devices, the devices may detect these batteries as not enough power even you fully charge them.\n",
      "Great for on the go charging Awesome convenience for recharging batteries.  Love them!\n",
      "What a great idea I'm using the batteries in my Wii.  I like new ideas and this is one.  It gives me options when I need to recharge.  Well made and working as advertised\n",
      "Really Useful A new - to me -  alternative to conventional AA batteries that you use and throw away.  Pop the top and plug it into the charger that comes with the batteries, and you're good to go.  I don't know how many charges they'll take, but I'm happy so far.\n",
      "The ones that work are awesome. The USB charging works great for my wireless mouse and keyboard, and most of the batteries have been working great. I've been using the batteries for about 2 years, and one of the batteries has always given me trouble, it would only last a few days in my mouse, while the others would last over a month. I could still use it in my keyboard, since it used less power, but today the battery stopped charging all together.\n",
      "usb aa batteries So far so good and can charge them in the car\n",
      "Excellent customer service Great batteries,excellent customer service!  The wire came out of the charger a couple of weeks after receiving, I contacted company and they immediately sent out a replacement. Would order again.\n",
      "Good idea no battery life. These are a great idea but there in no battery life, except when they first come out of the charger.Even then, they supply less than 50% of the power I get from AA's. I use them for photographs andget about 150 photos with AA's. These will maybe do 40 if they're freshly charged. Not practicalfor using in cameras outdoors.\n",
      "Good life out of a charge I use these on my GPS and they work great.\n",
      "Quick charging Charger allows you to turn off receptacles not being used.\n",
      "Great rechargeable batteries These are the greatest rechargeable batteries. Very. No bulky recharging unit.. You just flip the cab stick it in any USB wall unit that you would charge your cell phone with are you can stick it in the USB port on a computer or the back of your TV or anywhere there's a USB port on a power strip super super easy literally the best rechargeable battery ever made…\n",
      "Poor battery life Incredibly poor battery life after a single cycle. Thought they would be good controller batteries but BIG NO. I was really disappointed\n",
      "Works as advertised! You should purchase, fast delivery.\n",
      "They work well I started playing games on Xbox after a long hiatus and got tired of buying batteries, so I bought these. After 2 months of use them I am really happy with how well they work and how long they stay charged, I don't notice a difference between these are regular non-rechargeable batteries. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Great product My son got these in his ScoutBox subscription and loved them. I ordered extras for his xbox\n",
      "if you use AA like me, get these! I regularly go through a pack or three of AA batteries a month. for \"regular rechargeables\" I have to put them on charge once a week, and wait several hours before I can use them, but they degrade over time.with these, just plug them into Any USB port to recharge! quick, easy, and I use them all the time.\n",
      "So far I love them. Tentatively I’m giving these a five star, but I’m not finished testing them yet. I’ve charged them and put them in a flashlight that I’ve left on for four hours so far, and I’ll do the same until they run dry. But after four hours I couldn’t see any depreciable reduction in the strength of the light. So far they’re awesome, and I love the concept.\n",
      "Just what I needed! Charger works great and I’m very happy with it.\n",
      "Recharge in any USB port! This package is a dream! The included charger even has attractive LED lights (Red for Low, Blue for Charged). The four batteries were already fully charged when they reached me, and I haven't yet had to recharge them, so I can't tell you how fast or effectively the charger actually works — but they power my shaver beautifully, and I look forward to my next trip!I'll leave this lovely little charger at home and use my phone charger to charge these batteries (one at a time) if they should happen to need it, saving packing space. But, for home use, the four-port charger will be ideal.\n",
      "Great charge, easy to use, wonderful product! I've had so many BAD rechargeable AA in the past.  This one really is quick to charge, holds a charge, over and over again. I'm very impressed w/ these batteries and with other products I've gotten from this company.  Money well spent.  I will be getting more!  My garbage can and rockband guitars eats AA up like crazy!\n",
      "It works great It met and exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "Love! So far so good. Charged once and used in my normal remotes and even Polaroid camera.Would definitely buy more\n",
      "Disappointed Two of the four I received does NOT work. The charger came with it doesn't work either. Waste of money. Don't buy this.I hope I helped someone.\n",
      "Five Stars Thanks\n",
      "Work great! Charge up wonderful, and are just a great set of batteries. No complaints at all!\n",
      "Best battery idea ever Super awesome and good for the price\n",
      "Pretty good. Very easy to use and they charge very fast. Although they do last a good while, they do seem to not last as long as normal recharhables.\n",
      "Great batteries. Great batteries. This is my second set of LI batteries. They hold a charge well and last longer than NiMH ones, plus you can  charge them essentially anywhere. I'll follow up once I see how long They hold up.\n",
      "Small Hiccup, Great Customer Service 3 out of 4 batteries seem to be charging correctly, but the 4th won't seem to complete the charge cycle.  In the photo, the left battery charges and turns completely blue when charged, but the one on the right shows both a red and blue light at the same time and never seems to complete charging.  Not sure if this is just a one off?Update, seller contacted me about the dud battery, and immediatley sent out a replacement which works perfectly.  Great customer service, they really stand behind their  product, will buy from them again!\n",
      "Worked as advertised. Received batteries/ports in good condition. After topping off the charge. Tested them and they worked well in the two devices I used for testing.\n",
      "Doesn’t hold it power for long. Doesn’t hold it power for long.\n",
      "So far so good Think this was a good buy.\n",
      "Five Stars Great!\n",
      "Five Stars Great idea to decrease amount of batteries waste\n",
      "As good as it says Efficient and hub works perfectly.\n",
      "Batteries Good product. I like the ability to charge all 4 at some time with charger that came with it.\n",
      "Four Stars A good idea but the power storage capacity could be a lot greater!\n",
      "Great for power-users with a laptop and external mouse!!! I love these! Great for power-users with a laptop and external mouse!!!\n",
      "Too cool! Works great! My first experience with USB rechargeable batteries, too cool!\n",
      "All batteries charged quickly & easily using the USB charger/adapter Arrived as promised.  All batteries charged quickly & easily using the USB charger/adapter.  Not clear from other product descriptions - the USB tab is placed on the end of a \"shortened\" AA battery.  The USB cover, when closed, becomes the + end of the battery and the entire thing fits into the space normally reserved for a typical AA battery.  First use, all is fine.  Haven't owned long enough to deplete the first charge and recharge.\n",
      "Five Stars Great!\n",
      "Better then Best! I came across these and became obsessed with getting some. Found them on Amazon and wanted to try prior to a bulk order with manufacturer. Their amazing, just amazing! Every emergency kit needs to have these! I love that the USB charger to charge all 4 comes with them. I’ve been testing them with solar and hand crank generator too. I have used to charge portable lights and iPhone so far. The applications for use are endless, which is nifty to have when a disaster strikes!\n",
      "Four Stars these are rad batteries with a bonus.\n",
      "Really like them I have had these for a while and they have not disappointed.  Great for car camping.\n",
      "Five Stars Just what I needed.\n",
      "Great condition! Item works really well!Beyond expected!\n",
      "Good, convenient, and low priced batteries! When I got them I plugged the power bank into my laptop and they were charged within about 30 minutes! I use these for videogame controllers, because I use them quite a bit, and they last almost as long as a duracell battery, but i can just recharge them at the end of the day! I know I'm saving a lot of money using these instead of non-rechargeable ones.\n",
      "If you're thinking about buying them, DO IT! Three words: BEST. BATTERIES. EVER. The case doesn't affect them going into normal AA slots at all, they charge fast, and work great. No problems.\n",
      "Three Stars Works\n",
      "NOT WHAT THEY DESCRIBED!! Not what I expected and does hold charge very long if not in use! What's the point if I need them in a survival situation????\n",
      "Replaces regular batteries for a lot less $$ I ordered these for my son’s game controllers since we were spending quite a bit on regular batteries . I just received them a week ago but so far so good. The regular batteries only lasted 3-4 days but we are still on our first two since the initial charging. I think these batteries are going to be great.\n",
      "Great idea, but one was bad from the get go. Great in theory, but during the first use, one of the batteries overheated, melting the cap onto the body of the battery.  When I tried to pull it off, it broke off.  Not sure I'm going to bother to replace it; AA's just might be better.** Longer term update:  I never did replace the one, but the others are working just fine.\n",
      "Great idea, but it wasn't very practical for gaming ... The batteries are smaller than normal AA batteries. Great idea, but it wasn't very practical for gaming remotes.\n",
      "Five Stars Hey, completely works well and will buy another.\n",
      "Not good for digital cameras Used these batteries in a digital camera.  Only was able to take about 15 photos on a full charge.\n",
      "Love these batteries My 2nd purchase of these.  Why buy throw away battries when these are so easy to use.\n",
      "I like that this set comes with a charger I bought these for my sons Xbox controllers because he was burning through store bought AAs. These USB rechargeable batteries last just as long if not a little longer than store bought ones.I also gave 2 of them for my mother-in-law to use in her insulin pump. She was going through 1 lithium battery about 5-6 days. The rechargeable AAs last get around 4 days but she can recharge them which is saving her money.I like that this set comes with a charger, and I have already ordered another set and plan on ordering at least 2 more because they work, and just in case.\n",
      "I would buy this again So, far so good.  It has held the charge well for when I needed it.  I use this in my paintball equipment.  I still use the regular batteries for tournament days, but I will use this for practice days.  So far the charge has held really well in both the Spire and the CSR\n",
      "Each battery charged out of the pack. With another ... Each battery charged out of the pack.  With another suppliers battery’s, I had trouble getting two of them to charge.  The wall charger is worth the money. You always have fresh batteries ready and the usb charger is really handy.\n",
      "I love the USB AA Rechargeable batteries because are easy to ... I love the USB AA Rechargeable batteries because are easy to charge and fast. I purchased for my daughter Leapfrog device because we was spending too much in batteries.\n",
      "Long life and solar rechargeable. The long life and ease of use is very important to me plus the ability to Solar Charge.Nothing negative at this point.\n",
      "Great design and great product Great design and great product! Fit into everything I could test them in. Pretty fast with the charging as well. I would highly recommend them to anyone!\n",

These things are clutch, and last a good amount of time (about as long as a normal battery).  when I'm done, I just pop them in the USB charger and voila! (which is French for.... and then, they charge).\n",

      "Reliable Love this product. It beats buying batteries every month or weeks.,\n",
      "Capacity a bit lower than listed. I love EBL product however their batteries seamed always under perform a bit compare to the other product. For example when testing with 3 different testers I am getting about 80% of capacity while product like Tenavolt 2775mWh and AmpTorrent 3000mWh in the same type batteries overperform after multiple testing. First you have to concert mWh to mAh to compare to NiMh capacity and remember that NiMh are 1.2V batteries (for example Amazon Basics 2000Mah x 1.2v are 2400mWh capacity). This EBL, as well as Tenavolt and AmpTorrent are 1.5v batteries. I don't understand why last 2 I've mentioned have lower rating than EBL. Other than capacity raiting i think its a great product and performs well. I hope that helps.\n",
      "True 1.5v AA rechargeable batteries true 1.5v AA rechargeables. I should have bought them sooner.\n",
      "Absolute garbage So I bought these batteries hoping for something to replace my 1.2v rechargeable batteries that weren't providing quite enough power for my VR controllers.After charging them up they worked great for a total of two songs on beat saber (approx 7 minutes) before the controllers lost power.I recharged them today to give them another shot and was getting low battery indicators from the time I put them in until the controllers powered off 5 minutes later.I realize that one of the features of these batteries is that they are supposed to provide their peak of 1.5v for a larger percentage of the battery life, and for the short time they managed to keep a charge they worked great, but 7 minutes most likely sounds like they are either defective or just more garbage products as seems to be the trend lately.Either way I can't recommend wasting your time ordering these and will be returning them.\n",
      "Works in Blink XT2 Camera, Great Customer Support. I purchased these batteries to use in my Blink XT2 Security Camera's. I've had them for a week and they seem to be working good. I'm not sure how long they will last between charges.  Ebl has excellent customer service, they promptly replaced defective battery.\n",
      "Great charging features These batteries are very high capacity, 3300 mWh.  Charging is great... there are tiny sockets near the + end of the battery to plug in the neat USB to four plug harness.  How do you know when it is charged?  There is a charge indicator light that shines though the insulator around the positive terminal, red for charging, blue for charged.  It is all very neat and tidy.  And price was excellent, a very high value item.\n",
      "Great working batteries I use these to power my blink cameras. They work better than regular batteries and don't leave the cameras showing they were dying like other rechargeable batteries do. They charged easily. I would highly recommend these.\n",
      "EBL - AA BATTERIES THAT REALLY WORK. EBL is a really good product fast charging easy to use for on the go knowing life has many devices that needs batteries.  Very well made and just charges fast and battery life lasts long time.  I will be ordering more soon.......................\n",
      "Very good batteries The batteries seem to be of very good quality but time will tell. They are easy to charge with the included charger.\n",
      "Fire Hazard - Device & Batteries Get Way Hot I discounted some negative reviews on how much heat these batteries put off.  Now I'll have to go stand in line returning these little FIRE HAZARDs.  Have been using a 2 x AA battery flashlight for 6 years or so and these batteries are the first to get the aluminum housing hot to the touch.  Don't buy!  Here's the scenario no one wants, Dad buys batteries to run his kids flashlight.  Kid falls asleep with flashlight on...\n",
      "Didn’t last long. Not worth the $. Thought I would get more than a few hours on my scanner with these high dollar rechargeable batteries. Took a chance, I was wrong. Wouldn’t recommend them. I can’t imagine they would last very long in a digital camera either. Back to the Amazon basics batteries for me.\n",
      "Overall give the batteries 2 star's, not ultra high capacity There customer service is great, they reached out to me because of my experience. But because the batteries are not compatible with standard charging methods and only can be charged with the usb charger I still don't recommend them. And the usb port in the battery is a problem with getting dirt and debris inside the port and not being able to charge properly. Plus apon further review the capacity is misleading, only about half of what is rated at.If the batteries were compatible with stand charging and usb then they would be recommended. But since only can be charged with there usb charger it's another thing to misplace or lose.I just really wanted ultra high capacity batteries, but these are not ultra high capacity, just slightly higher than normal capacity.\n",
      "These Batteries work just fine in my thermostat! I tried other rechargeable batteries in my thermostat but they did not last long before they needed to be recharged. I haven't had to recharge these yet.\n",
      "Not for high demand device They seem to work fine in my remotes, cordless trimmer and small LED flashlights, but wont power my 51 LEDUV pet pee light for more than a few minutes. I wasn't even able to get one room fully inspected. Changed torechargeable Li - On to finish the whole house. I gave them a full over night charge and gave them an otherchance to see if they could handle it. nope, same result. They all put out 1.497 to 1.498 volts on my multi-meter,before and after the tests. I think the UV light draws about 1.1 Amp.\n",
      "Nice package, HOT buttontops! Obviously it will take time to see how these hold up. The total package is excellent --- it's very handy to be able to recharge batteries without a clunky charging station. The lower capacity (volume being taken up by the electronics inside) is worth it.HOWEVER ---Try NOT to touch the buttontops while these are charging (at least for the first 2/3)!!! They get HOT!\n",
      "Limited use issue. Purchased for my first time in use new Water Pic water flosser and these batteries would not properly run the device.  They would run full speed for a few seconds then reduce the speed to somewhere around half speed.  Turn the device off and back on resulted in the same issue.  Batteries do not appear to be suitable for items that are running high drain motors.  Went back to using metal hydride rechargeables in the Water Pic with no issues.  The EBLs were retired to a low draw device with success, LED headlamp.\n",
      "Two batteries and the charging cable are all dead after only 1 or 2 times of charging Two of the four batteries and the usb charging cable stop working (the batteries cannot be recharged any more and the cable is completely dead) only after one month of just 1 or 2 times of charging.Update: I received replacement batteries today.  EBL does have great and fast customer service.  However, EBL really needs to improve the quality of this rechargeable battery and its charging cable.  Another cable stops working for me today!\n",
      "these aa batteries are so good These are a life changer. i use so many aa batteries, i was spending so much. now, with a bit of upfront investment, im set for a WHILE. They have already paid for themselves, i had been using very expensive off the shelf non rechargeable lithium batteries. these, are so much better. they are the best aa battery i have been able to locate. seriously awesome tech\n",
      "Extremely difficult to insert mini USB After I received the item my plan was to charge the batteries right away. The only difficulty I had was to insert the mini USB into the batteries.After a few minutes of fumbling with it I finally got all of the four plugged in.  Hopefully next charging will go easier.\n",
      "Slight bit larger diameter vs the typical AA alkaline version. The constant voltage is a huge benefit for my application which is a night vision device.  This unit normally runs through a set of  4 AA alkaline batteries in approx 4 hours.  I have purposely left the unit on for 4 hours continuous and they were still running strong.  Also the fast recharge is a huge benefit.These batteries are slightly larger and fit snug in one of the battery holes on the device so that one is always tough to remove while alkaline AA batteries fall out right out.  Also, wish the USB charge adapter had a micro-B port so I could simply plug my regular charge cable in when I don't want to use the USB-A standard plug with a very short cable that goes directing into the charger.\n",
      "Great batteries Charge last a long time in my GPS unit. 2 to 3 times longer than the original battery pack.\n",
      "Great New Technology Using these in powerful, high drain walkie talkie radios:  They provide FULL power, voltage, until exhausted (then, they \"die\" almost instantly!);  they fully charge in 2 hours or less ;  no bulky charger needed,  they charge from any USB charger, 4 batteries are \"ganged\" together to charge from one USB port --- so, convenient to charge even in the car; an indicator pilot light on the battery changes from red, to blue, when the battery is fully charged.\n",
      "Charging circuits in battery makes RF noise There must be an oscillating DV circuit in these that is active on use.  After charging i tried them different LED flashlights and also a handheld Aviation Transceiver.  Both LED flashlight's beam quickly started shaking and then turned off.  The batteries created so much RF noise in my handheld aviation transceiver and it could not be used.I had 12 batteries and tried different combinations - all bad.I have no idea what others are using these for to give them a 5 star rating.  I'm a EE engineer.\n",
      "batteries good deal\n",
      "Surprisingly short usage time 3300 Mwh converts to 2200 MaH...These things do not come even close to achieving either of those numbers. On a set of Alkaline batteries I can operate my el-cheapo LED flashlight for 8 to 10 hours....These batteries did not even last for 3.\n",
      "excellent battery that charges to 1.5 volts. great battery that fully charges to 1.5 volts for use by any appliance.  Don't waste your money for those batteries that only charge to 1.2 volts.\n",
      "Great rechargeable batteries Comes with charging cable\n",
      "Well-made high-quality long-lasting Very well-made\n",
      "Lasts a long time. Really long time. Best batteries for I've used for my Odyssey plus VR controllers. The Duracell batteries would last me like 6 hours before being red, and these batteries last me for 2 to 3 days of heavy VR use.\n",
      "Terrible These were terrible. They actually didn't fully charge even a single time and were promptly returned them.\n",
      "SCAMMED NOT WHAT WAS IN THE PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION!! I got an 1100 mah battery instead of 3300mah and there is no usb to charge the battery! I got scammed!\n",
      "Finally a decent rechargeable!! I’ve been waiting for a true 1.5 volt AA rechargeable battery all my life.  I was pretty excited for these when I saw them. In the past you had rechargeable AA’s but they where only 1.2v and not very high capacity.  Then lithium came along, but they where all 3.7 volt. You could make that work on some things using a blank “dummy” battery but the voltages still weren’t right and if your device takes 6 batteries there’s no way to get the voltage close using dummy batteries with those..  but then these batteries can along and solved all those problems. My main use for them is in my hands free stainless garbage can. It has a motion sensor and opens when your hand is near it and runs on 6 AA batteries. I would go through batteries every 1.5 months and it seemed like a real waste to me. The new EBL Lithium rechargeable batteries lasted 1 month and 10 days before needing recharged, so maybe a week less than conventional alkaline batteries. The one big difference I noticed though was these batteries worked strong right up to the point they were dead and could no longer open the lid.  Alkaline batteries lasted slightly longer, but with degraded operation for the last week or so which gave plenty of warning the batteries where going dead. I assume this has to do with the internal circuitry that protects the batteries from voltage dropping too low.  The best part is when the batteries go dead they charge up in an hour or two (not sure exactly as I walked out of the room).  I waited a month to review this so I could see how they compared with alkaline batteries and in my personal application I can say I am very happy with them. I’ve bought two 4 packs of these batteries and will likely buy more in the near future.\n",
      "Checked with my multimeter. I just received these batteries with a low charge.  Suits me.  They claim to hold a constant voltage across their entire charge cycle, and I can easily put that to the test right off the bat.  An Alkaline battery cell is 1.5V.  Most rechargeable AA batteries are Nickel-Metal Hydride (NIMH), which only has a 1.2V cell.  I’m going to scrutinize these with my multimeter to see how they hold up.The first thing I did upon receiving this package was test the voltage of all the batteries.  They were all very near 1.49V.  I then put them on the charger, and it took approximately 95 minutes to achieve a full charge so I know they didn’t have much juice originally.  These batteries are consistently showing a voltage very close to 1.49V.  I’ve included a photo of my multimeter reading 1.491V and the average voltage I’m reading across all four batteries is 1.493V.  Fortunately, there’s no discernible difference between these batteries at a full charge, or at a low charge.  Whereas an alkaline battery will start with 1.5-1.6V and the voltage gradually diminishes, this one seems to run at 100% voltage up until the end of its life.  I’m very happy with my initial tests on these batteries.  The output voltage is constant and essentially perfect at damn near exactly 1.5V, far better than a 1.2V NIMH rechargeable battery. I even had one read exactly 1.5V (pictured).As others here have pointed out most AA battery brands advertise their life in milliamp hours, but this advertises itself in milliwatt hours.  So the 3300 mWh converts to 2200 mAh.  (3300 mWh / 1.5V = 2200 mAh)  This isn’t a problem with the battery per se, just the marketing.I purchased these a bit experimentally.  I’m an electrician.  After burning up a few too many AAs and AAAs on some of my less-powerful battery operated tools, I’ve been looking into getting rechargeables.  I was primarily intrigued by the high capacity, the constant voltage, and the quick and easy recharge of these.  I also needed to be able to recharge these quickly with or without access to power, as I can do courtesy of my Makita ADP05 (pictured).  Between the constant (and correct) voltage, high energy capacity, fast recharge, and convenient USB charger, my first impression of these is very positive.  I’ll update this if anything else worth mentioning comes to my attention.\n",
      "I had an issue and EBL responded quckly and resolved it The original batteries I received were defective and EBL responded quickly replacing them. These batteries recharge my powerful camera flash quicker that my other 1.2 NiMH ones. They allow me to capture a burst of 3 flash photos in one second vice only 2 with standard ones. I am very pleased with the batteries and EBL's response.\n",
      "👍 👍\n",
      "Does not last on a flashlight for more than 2 mins Does not last even 2 mins on a flashlight. Don't waste your time and money. Item is going to be returned soon.\n",
      "Skeptical Time will tell.  So far these are better than others I've tried.  They get warm on tips when charging,  as long as they don't explode I'm in. I doubt that micro port can handle being abused 1000 times or more..\n",
      "Replaced my NiMH with these batteries. Great for game controllers. Before using Lithium batteries I was using NiMH high capacity batteries also from EBL. These Li batteries last twice the time and get full charge in no more than 2 hours. The NiMH took half a day to recharge  and my kids were driving me crazy asking for the status.\n",
      "Long Lasting Under Heavy Use Great performance until they just die out. Much longer lasting NI-MH batteries. Cool the way it recharges by plugging it into a usb port. Highly recommend for heavy Loads.\n",
      "Like the charging system! So far so good!\n",
      "Never worked, don't waste your money Says fully charged, but won't work at all.  Put these batteries in a known-good Canon strobe, batteries wouldn't even handle a single flash.  Worthless.  Will return.Update:  EBL customer service sent me another set of these batteries, since the set I bought on Amazon plainly was defective.  The second set is only marginally better.  The new set will power my Canon 600EXII-RT stobe for a few flashes, but only with very long recycle times, far longer than I am accustomed to with either alkaline or Eneloop.EBL customer service contacted me again, and that's where it got really weird.  Their customer service person, a Joseph Huang, tells me that these AA batteries can't be used as replacements for alkaline or NiMH (e.g., Eneloop) batteries.  That, even though their own product description says they are 1.5 volt AA batteries.  Then he got insisted that I should try \"other suitable devices\" despite EBL's own description saying \"Long battery life up to 1200 cycles AA rechargeable lithium battery, ideal for digital cameras, remote controls, toys, and more for high current applications.\"  My Canon strobes are high current for a brief period, yet these batteries do not work.I've read the other reviews that say these batteries work great.  Sure wish I had gotten such a set.\n",
      "Great battery Everything I was expecting,  very satisfied\n",
      "Super durability! I'm using it for my Oculus Quest controllers. A regular Duracell was lasting max. 1 week. Cheap Ikea pill was lasting 2 days. I've been using these for 2 weeks. I thought I could get 4 and switch everytime it dies and charge the other ones but I didn't even needed to charge so far. I've checked all of the alternatives. This is the best quality for the price.\n",
      "So far so good Bought these for a Wyze Lock (it takes 1.5v not 1.2v) that was eating through regular batteries. They would lose 5% or more every 2 days. Changed them out for these and it's almost been a week and they've only dropped 1%. Time will tell if these hold up but so far so good!!!!\n",
      "Keep spent batteries out of the garbage dump! Charges in 2 hours.\n",
      "Will buy again I bought these batteries use for kids Xbox controllers and I have really been impressed with the long battery life of each charge. These batteries are great! They charge so much faster than others .Plan to buy another set for my other AA devices as well.\n",
      "Great lasting batteries Longest lasting batteries I've used in a Nest smoke/CO detector so that I don't have to replace the batteries so frequently. We tried alkaline and NiCad rechargeable batteries but the power output was just slightly too low.\n",
      "Good way to replace AA alkaline Batteries We purchased to use in some baby items where we felt regular non-rechargeable batteries weren't lasting very long because the devices are used so much.These Lithium ion batteries works well and last longer than regular batteries. The design is neat where each battery lights up during charging,and I can charge the batteries with the usb at anytime.\n",
      "buen producto Son muy útiles para controles remotos duran más que otras\n",
      "Last long Batteries of good quality and last a long time. Would recommend.\n",
      "High powered batteries Good batteries and the shipping was fast.\n",
      "1.5V Baby! Just got them. So far they work where the NiMH wouldn't due to low voltage.\n",
      "A A\n",
      "usb rechargeable battery The USB cable battery is more suitable for outdoor charging than other rechargeable batteries.You can using this 4 in 1 charging cable to charge multiple devices at the same time. So far, they are running well and last a long time in my wireless security camera, it can be fully charged in a few hours. The rechargeable battery greatly extends the life of the battery.It is strongly recommended to use rechargeable batteries,which can reduce costs and reduce pollution.\n",
      "Amazing Using these for my blink xt cameras as they take lithium batteries only. Phenomenal for the price and they charge via micro USB. Very happy with it\n",
      "Great for game controllers I got these for an off-brand Switch controller that takes a couple AAs. After about two and a half weeks of heavy use, I finally had to swap pairs and recharge. I'm usually lucky to get a week out of the Switch Pro controller. These batteries are great!\n",
      "Easy charge I like the usb charging, this is such a smart design!!I did not even know about this until my friend introduce this to me.You can charge directly to the battery, and I can use power bank to charge if I am not in the house. It is very easy to use and charge.\n",
      "long lasting durable for lengthy periods\n",
      "Good Value & Saving money These batteries are saving me money. I have to ofen replace the batteries on a security camera, and these batteries last a longer time and can be recharged up to 1200 times, avoid replacing the batteries so frequently.\n",
      "Worth buying! Have had these for a few weeks now. I am using this product in a number of remote controls that I use daily and often. They are lasting a LONG TIME compared to single use alkaline or normal rechargeable batteries. I wanted batteries that would have steady power for a longer period of time.\n",
      "Happy with the purchase I need a lot of AA battery for my work. I definitely need rechargeable AA battery.These are great batteries and high capacity that last longer than regular batteries.This is very convenient and fast to be full charged with micro usb charge. I like it so far and I wish it can last forever.\n",
      "Nice rechargable batteries Use these in my outdoor devices because they work even when it's well below freezing. They also last much longer than regular batteries. Regular alkaline batteries start showing a drop in voltage after about a week and will no longer operate the door after about 2 1/2 months. These lithium batteries still show 100% after 5 weeks.EBL lithium AA batteries are the strongest I have found and last the longest.\n",
      "Really Nice I really enjoy them, fast charging also Thanks\n",
      "Do you really need these? If you absolutely need 1.5V and quick recharge then these are your babies. The mWh rating is deceptive ... these batteries have lower capacity than their NiMh cousins and won't last all that long in a lot of devices. If you have a flashlight that is for occasional use than these will work. If you are using them for emergency lighting on lanterns etc I would pass. There is nothing wrong with them when the application fits, otherwise I would go with a high capacity NiMh cell. NiMh cells out performed these in almost every application. As I said there are situations where you might need these but for the most part I would pass. In truth the mAh rating is more like a 17 or 1800 NiMh cell when you consider that the the sustained 1.5V will cause them to discharge faster.\n",
      "Great batteries with great battery life! I put these in my trail cams,they last more than 2x longer than alkalines. Power doesn't drop off like alkalines do and recharging is simple with the usb connector and takes about 2 hours if fully drained.\n",
      "Perfect Very good batteries,It charges very quickly and has a longer life than traditional batteries. works as expected.\n",
      "Excellent Excellent\n",
      "Very inovative batteries Whoever designed these batteries is very clever.  I love the fact that they out out 1.5 volts for the first 90% of their charge cycle.\n",
      "Convenient Lithium batteries These are nice because they are easy to charge. And this battery seems to be lasting as long as advertised.\n",
      "Do not need to worry about the battery for kids toys I used to buy regular batteries, and need to storage a lot of batteries at home. Because I have a lot of kids toys that require AA batteries,and they are using the battery so quickly.I want to found a rechargeable battery so that I don't need to replace the battery again and again.I like this USB rechargeable batteries,it can be used for much longer than usual with a full charge. And it's easy to charge. With charging cable. No need to keep preparing a lot of batteries at home. This makes me very satisfied!\n",
      "FOLLOW UP TO MY PREVIOUS REVIEW ON EBL BATTERY I want to shout out for the Customer Service Depart (particularly Joseph). He reached out to me regarding my negative review on the EBL batteries I purchased. He apologized that the product had issues and offered to send replacement items which I am going to try.THE IMPORTANT POINT OF THIS REVIEW IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR GENUINE CONCERN that the customer/end user is thoroughly satisfied. I APPRECIATE THEIR KIND GESTURE.i AM GOING TO TRY PRODUCT AGAIN AND WILL GIVE A FOLLOW UP REVIEW.\n",
      "Great product. Got these for use in my windows mixed reality controllers. They last so long.\n",
      "Long lasting well made I bought these batteries for use in my trail cameras. So far they have been working for a week. One drawback is the charging cord is a little short. I suspect I will be using these batteries for quite while. I love the charging light, it allows mw to charge them in the field.\n",
      "EBL Batteries Make The Grade I took a chance on an unknown name for rechargeables - I am glad I did. I bought the 18650-type first, and was surprised by their longevity and short recharge time. I am hooked on this name from here forward. I have purchased more AA-size for my devices that can use rechargeables, and used one set in my camera this weekend - still almost full charge after 170+ photos.I can vouch for EBL quality and will be using these exclusively in the future.\n",
      "Very good rechargable batteries! These batteries are for our digital camera. So far they are very dependable and stay charged longer than normal batteries. Love this rechargable style too.\n",
      "Easy to use and charge fast The set of 4 pieces of AA battery works amazing.The added voltage 1.5V over NimH 1.2V batteries is nice, I use it every day on everything.They have a unique design with a micro-USB port in the side of the battery, it can be recharged by just plug in any USB port like laptops, wall adapter, etc. almost anywhere anytime. They also have a red and green LED to indicate that it is charging or fully charged.It only takes about 1.5 hours to get rapidly fully charged. I find out it is very useful for my work and household. Will buy more batteries.\n",
      "Working great so far They arrived quickly and came with a USB cable. I charged all batteries and put them in my GPS. It’s been a couple weeks and I’ve had no issues.\n",
      "Perfect Works!!! I'm getting more\n",
      "Diameter is larger than normal AA batteries Diameter is larger than normal AA batteries\n",
      "Appears to have long battery life Excellent battery life,It lasted longer than other aa rechargeable batteries I had. I would buy it again in the near future.\n",
      "Good Rechargeable AA Batteries A good quality set of rechargeable AA batteries. It's convenient to charge the batteries with the provided usb cord. The batteries are stable and durable. It takes about 2 hours to charge.\n",
      "Long lasting, reliable I have several door locks that use these batteries in sets of four. Cheap batteries don't last any time at all and absolutely die in winter time. These are the best battery that I have found for this use. They also last much longer than regular batteries.\n",
      "I love these batteries! I think these are great! I put several into my remote controls, computer mouse and Xbox. So far, I've been using them for months and have not had to recharge any of them. I really like the fact that the recharging port is built into the side and it is convenient to charge.\n",
      "They work very well! I use these for computer gaming equipment that requires batteries and a strong and long life span. I really love these batteries they come with a 4 USB charger in one. So easy to charge and they hold their charge for a long time. I recommend highly!\n",
      "Best AA you can buy. The best batteries I have bought so far for my Blink outdoor cameras!\n",
      "Long lasting, worth the extra cost I use these in our security cameras and they last a year or more depending on use. Lithium batteries don't leak so they protect the electronics. These were an excellent value as well. We purchased cheap batteries for an outdoor door lock and they leaked acid everywhere and ate thru the metal. These have held up well and are great power life. Also great for wall clocks that don’t need to be changed often.overall a great battery at a great price. Very happy with purchase.\n",
      "My Favorite AA Lithium Batteries These batteries lasted longer than any I have purchased. We first purchased these to use in our Blink system as they require Lithium batteries to last very long. As I've used these in other things, they have quickly become my favorite. They go in remote controls, my pulse oximeter I use for work, and the household clocks.  I will definitely be buying them again.\n",
      "It's so cool! But storage capacity is misleading, It's in Mwh instead of the standard Mah I really like this battery because its 1.5v, it's Lithium, so you're getting all the power instead of another other than die off as you use them. But the capacity is misleading.It's listed as 3300 MWh, while the standard EBL rechargeable is 2800 MAh. The capacity of the lithium battery is 2/3 the standard rechargeable battery at only 2200 mah.So they are great if you need something with extra power like audio equipment or something sensitive or more powerful. For regular use, the regular rechargeable aa EBL battery is better because the capacity is 1/3 larger.I ran by sons hot wheel track with these at the Standard EBL's ran for 4hrs23min. The lithium EBL Rechargeable lasted for almost 2hrs. It ran those motors SO SO fast, which is fantastic, but the run time, in reality, was less than 1/2.I recharged and tested them a few times and got the same results. I shot a review on YouTube if someone wants to see me to the whole break down. @dothingsmakestuffThey are perfect some AA to carry in my backpack because of their easy of charge, but at $5 a piece, they don't replace all my standard EBL batteries!\n",
      "These are the best AA rechargeable 1.5 volt batteries on the market!! The only thing I would improve would be higher MAH and I wish all these companies would quit trying to trick people by using  MWh instead of MAH it is deceiving because no batteries ever used this rating until the new 1.5v rechargeable came out. That being said these batteries are well built, charge really fast and have the highest Mah , 2200 , witch is the highest available on the market at this time!!!!! EBL also has the best customer support staff that I have come across, if you have any problems they fix it immediately without having to jump through a bunch of hoops or 15 phone calls!!!!!!!!!! 5 Stars all the way!!!!Now I wish they would come out with some AAA's with 1.5 volts and 1100MAh witch is what their 1.2 voly batteries currently have and we could all go green and quit buying alkiline batteries and start using recharigables, we have the technology to make great rechargiables so lets start doing it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "Power stick These work great in electric razors ,easy To store and easy to charge\n",
      "So far so good. So far so good I will update the review as I use them more.\n",
      "Brighter Flashlight Bought a Nicron N7 flashlight that runs fine on a standard AA battery but with these high MA output the beam is blinding And since they are rechargeable I always have a fresh battery ready to go!\n",
      "They don't work I received 2 packs yesterday. I bought them for my Nest protect smoke detector. Before I bought them I made sure they are 1.5 volts as most rechargeable batteries are 1.2 volts. Fully charged them for a couple of hours and sure enough when installed they won't work. You will put any other AA battery in and it will work, just not these. Very disappointed considering the higher price paid for quality batteries. Returning these tomorrow.\n",
      "Drained in 4 days flat Tries using 4 of these in a smartlock and the lock stopped functioning after 4 days of normal use. NiMH batteries with the same lock last for at least a month and I was hoping to get more out of these. I tested the 4 batteries with a 1-battery LED flash light and two of the batteries were completely dead (i.e. the LED did not even light up), the other two appeared to be Ok. I think I must have received 2 defective batteries. For this price I expected much better quality compared to eneloops. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Expensive and don't last Had them in two cameras and monitored the power.  Two cells are good (nearly full voltage) and two cells are dead.  Even after using their garbage proprietary charger, they don't show voltage after ~2 hours charging and turning green.  Wouldn't buy again even if they were $1 each (and they are substantially more).\n",
      "Great for Wifi controllable devices Of the batteries I know of, these are the best AA rechargeable batteries you can buy. More juice, longer lasting and can deal with cold and hot weather. We use them in our wireless cameras in the element and they do great. I’ve also used them in an Xbox one controller and they lasted considerably long verses normal, non lithium big brands. In my flashlight they are powerful and work great.\n",
      "The best overall testing EBL are the new kids on the block 1.5 V not 1.2 Yes USB batteries on the market for 1.5 V you can only usually 51.2 V if you can find it by at 100% satisfaction guaranteed a little expensive but it’s definitely Green\n",
      "Better than the regular AA batteries !! I use these batteries in cellular trail cameras. They last the longest and perform great in cold weather.These batteries have a high lithium content and I've found them to absolutely deliver on their promise of long lasting power. Considerably longer life in my experience. The only downside is this longevity comes at added expense, but it worth it cause these are rechargeable.Purchase these if you need longevity in any AA battery powered device, or in AA powered devices with a high drain, you'll have more juice for longer play/run time.\n",
      "Worth the money These AA USB lithium batteries are convenient to charge anywhere with micro USB., I can charge them with the micro USB cord directily, I can save my money without to buy extra battery charger for these recharge batteries. The capacity on these is impressive, I use them in my mBot Ranger as they have more power than usual non rechargeable cheep battery's. worth the money for the long run\n",
      "Amazing Battery Life I picked these up to use in my Xbox controller, The Battery life is amazing they last me a week before they need a charge and they charge quickly. The batteries have a micro usb port for charging and the four port cord that comes with them is extremely helpful so u can charge all them and get back to the use in no time.\n",
      "EBL makes some great batteries, but ,this time they dropped the ball I'm truly a fan of EBL batteries. However, these in particular will not hold a charge. That being said,as with any mass production product, there will be a small number of failures. I have had a few minor issues with other EBL batteries in the past as well. Though not a big deal.At that time EBL had great customer service and promptly resolved the matter. This time however, their customer service seems to be failing and getting warranty on their products are many times more difficult than the past. Very disappointing. Once thought they had the potential to give the big bunny a run for his money.\n",
      "AA Lithium Rechargeables, but... Well, the capacity is impressive. Don't know how many cycles these will do. Beware though, you can only charge these using micro USB connector. I have a fancy batt charger that charges everything, but these will not charge in a charging unit. When on USB manual says red light is charging mode, blue light is full charge. The batts I got needed 30min to charge back up full.\n",
      "Cool design, can be charged with Micro-B USB I got them two days ago and was charged for 2 hours as mentioned in the description. They come on Red when initially plugged and turned Blue when fully charged (not Green as stated in the description).I like the fact that they can be charged with any Micro-B USB 5-PIN (“Android charger”). I used them today in lapel microphone and wireless handheld microphone for a continuous 4-hour use. They actually put out 1.5v compare to the previous Amazon Basics I have been using 1.2v; which require me change them every two hours. The voltage of the EBL remained the same after 4 full hour used. So, less charging.04/05/2020 Update - Two months after I first purchased these batteries, and charged them, I still haven't recharged them yet. I use them for four continuous hours every Sunday. I am so impressed, I went on and bought four more sets to replace ALL my Amazon Basics batteries that we use in the handheld microphones.\n",
      "I love these batteries! I love these batteries, and keep buying more. They charge quickly and last about as long as a throwaway alkaline. The only thing I don’t like about the new design is the micro USB port is on the end/tip of the batter. I personally prefer it on the side the way previous generations had it. Still a great battery though!\n",
      "Appears to be as promised - Initial quality seems fine This is a new set up for me after years of using re-chargeables.  I haven't put them through the test of multiple cycles but the batteries are a decent weight, charged fast and charger cord seems to be good quality.  I will report back if they fail in any way\n",
      "Good. Solid so far. Use for XB1 controller..\n",
      "Great product I am very satisfied with this product.  It did exactly what I wanted it to do.\n",
      "fully charged in less than an hour liked the way they charged quickly  have not had a chance to try them out in my Guardian driveway security  will followup in future\n",
      "Lengths of connector chords are short. These are great rechargeable batteries and they work as described.\n",
      "Great value Really like the flexibility of having rechargeable batteries like this. Simple charging cord to charge all four included. Great value\n",
      "K747 Improved connector joint, Fast recharge, high performance.\n",
      "Reusable and convenient They seem to hold a charge very well. The indicator lights make it easy to tell when it’s charged (green = full charge; red = not so much with the charge). A great alternative to using regular batteries.\n",
      "Excellent Excellent performance\n",
      "Very dangerous and hazardous. #1. They have a very small positive tip and the cell does not center on the positive round bump on your device.#2. They do not have a current limiting/protection circuit to keep them running cool.#3. The shrink wrapping cover melted off the cell and melted the interior of my valuable flashlight. The NiCad batteries I have been using run fine without any issues in my flashlight.#4. I hope Amazon will review this product before someone has an explosion and gets hurt.\n",
      "These work surprisingly well I was a little skeptical about these batteries, because of their unusual charging design. However, they work great. Previously I used eneloop batteries, and they were ok for most devices. However, the eneloops didn't work so well in motorized devices. These Blackube batteries are great, and seem just as good as alkaline batteries.There is only one downside: Most other batteries slowly start to fade when they run out of juice. These Blackube batteries don't give you any warning. They just suddenly turn off when they run out. That won't keep me from giving them a 5-star rating though. I love these batteries.\n",
      "They keep on going and going and going. My son (kindergartner) has this night light that projects star constellations on the wall and ceiling. The plug doesn't work with it so I have to use batteries. He likes it on all night. So that's basically four AA batteries a night. Very expensive habit.Enter the Blackube (a company from which I've gotten several batteries). All I have to do is keep plugging these in and charging them. I've already done it many nights since I've gotten these and they are still going strong. I am saving so much money on these vs. using non-rechargeable batteries.A note on longevity. I put one of these into my son's vibrating tooth brush and it's been going strong all week (I haven't recharged it yet.).I highly recommend Blackube. I will be looking for more battery types from them.\n",
      "Great option! It does its job. Batteries that recharge are definitely a good option to reduce e-waste. If you can spare the cash I'd say grab some for everyday use items like remotes and game controllers.\n",
      "Excellent I've got AA battery-powered temperature sensors in both my refrigerator and freezer. Most types of batteries don't work well once they get below  0°F but I've read that lithium can still operate down to -40°F. That made these AA'a the perfect choice for my situation: They're Lithium and they're rechargeable so economical in the long run.I've had them in use continuously for the last month and they've been perfect. When I used to use NiMh rechargeables or alkalines, the temperature readouts, especially from the freezer, would often become intermittent especially below zero. That has stopped happening completely. Once I charged the Blackubes up using the 4-headed USB cable that comes with them, they have performed perfectly, 24/7, ever since.\n",
      "Quick to recharge I got these for my Oculus Rift S controllers because they eat batteries. They charge up fast, and there are four of them with a clever USB splitter that can charge them all at once. One oddity is that when they are in my controllers, they always show up on the Oculus app as fully charged, so when they die, it's a shock, because the voltage does not properly display. Still, these are incredibly economical.\n",
      "Great for battery operated devices that you use often. These batteries are perfect for a remote or other device too use often.\n",
      "Charges rapidly has long battery life These high capacity batteries worked a charm in my emergency lighting when our power was out for 14 hours a couple of weeks ago.  My emergency lamp in my family room takes 3 AA batteries and I usually have to change them after 4 hours of continuous use on high. These batteries lasted the entire 14 hours and may have just begun to dim but it was getting light outside so difficult to tell.In any event, they more than surpassed expectations!It took only 2 1/2 hours for them to re-charge to full.\n",
      "Very Useful, With an Unexpected Problem This is a really interesting concept and this is coming from someone that 3D printed AA to D cell adapters.  In our ever-common world of rechargeable devices, I still find myself looking for standard Alkaline batteries.  Smart locks, my Fluke Linksprinter that I use for work, and still most every remote I can think of still use AA cells.  These are all most frustrating when they go dead.Ok, so these are $26 for four AA batteries.  That is not a small chunk of change.A typical alkaline AA battery seems to be around 1200 to 1900 mAh.  This battery is lithium-based and has an 1850 mAh capacity each so that would be basically on par with a standard battery.  The package comes with a four-way split micro USB charger for charging them all at once.  There is a led that glows red while charging and turns green when done.  This version has the charging plug on the top near the positive terminal so you do have to take them out to charge them.In testing this product I have found quite an unexpected problem: they can get easily lost.  It seems they were grabbed up by the kids and used for some unknown device.  Sooo basically, I am forced to wait for the said device to go dead or check through them all before I can find them.  There is also the possibility that they could be thrown out accidentally if someone is not paying attention.  When I get them back I will make bright labels for them and they are going to work to live in my Fluke.\n",
      "Long lasting Bought these for a night vision scope. They work perfect and actually hold a charge longer than any other batteries I've tried.\n",
      "Perfect for my Xbox One controller Rather than burn through a set of AA every other week, I just rotate these in and out now.  They literally plug into a micro USB charger, though I still use the 4 headed dragon these came with.  Time will tell how long they last, but the construction is well made.  5 stars, but a recommendation you don't put these into something that will see a lot of abuse because I can't tell how thick the protective casing is.\n",
      "Well made These batteries are well made. They charge quickly and work well. They indicate with a red light when they are charging and a green light when fully charged. They are a very nice product.\n",
      "Clever design, very different from other rechargeables There are one or two things about these that I think could have been done better, but these are some of the best rechargeable AA batteries I’ve ever used.  Normal, non-rechargeable AA batteries put out 1.5 volts.  For some reason that I’ve never understood rechargeable batteries, whether they’re NiCad, NiMh, and even the ultra popular Enloops only put out 1.2 volts.  Now most devices are designed to operate on less voltage than the combined total of the batteries they take, but not all of them.  The ones that are actually expecting the full voltage tend to react either by drawing more current from the batteries to compensate and making the rechargeable batteries last half as long, or malfunctioning in a variety of ways.  The Blackube rechargeables are the first I’ve ever used that actually put out the same 1.5 volts as a standard AA.The full voltage aspect is probably these can’t be recharged with a normal AA battery charger.  They have a micro USB port instead.  This has the advantage that you done actually need a separate device to charge them.  The 4-pack comes with a 4-way charging cable, however the carrying case only has room for the batteries not the cable, so it might be easy to accidentally separate them.  If you lose the cable, you can still use any old micro USB cable to charge them, but only one battery per cable at a time.The capacity on these is really impressive.  I’ve been using a pair in my XBONE controller and after 12 hours of play time they still show as 100% charged.These are by far my favorite rechargeables because they’re compatible with devices that are traditionally not compatible with rechargeables (because of the goofy 1.2V vs 1.5V thing), they recharge very quickly on a quick charger circuit and they have an amazing amount of capacity.\n",
      "What will they think of next! I feel old sometimes with all these new-fangled things coming out, but hey, I have a set of rechargeable batteries and saw these - the fact that they can be charged via usb was so cool!  They charged quickly and work great in my devices that use AA batteries.  I like having some batteries that can be charged in my car or with a charged battery pack should I need some for a light or other item.  The fact that the batteries come with a charging cord so they are all charged at the same time is perfect.  I would recommend these to anyone who prefers having rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "Weak, die quick These die pretty quick, I put two I'm a mini flash light that wasnt used very long and at all and within a few hrs it was flashing instead of staying lit\n",
      "high capacity, easy to charge i like the new design of rechargeable batteries. i like the fact you don't need a charging station or multiple USB outlets to charge them all.  the charge up fairly quick and provide a good amount of juice to your device (or in our case our kids toys...)  recommended!\n",
      "Loves these Love the usb charging, comes in a nice case you can charge all at the same time. Works great, seem to be of good quality. I am thrilled with these\n",
      "Blackube AA Rechargeable Batteries are the best I have found I am only using Blackube rechargeable batteries from now on. They last twice as long and have a stronger charge. I love that I don't have to recharge them as often, especially when I use them in my electronic cat toys since you have to unscrew the cover for the batteries. Trying to fend off my cat while I am switching out the batteries out is both annoying and very amusing!\n",
      "Charged super fast These are mini-USB rechargeable, so you don't have to have a bulky contraption to recharge! Plus, it only took about an hour for the initial charge to give me a green light from the red that initially showed when I plugged them in. They come in a convenient little plastic case.\n",
      "Very light batteries Li Power benefits These batteries are much lighter than Ni-Mh batteries and retain full power till the end.  The charge via USB with a provided 4 port cable.  Multimeter shows accurate readings and the batteries do not get very warm during charging.\n",
      "great spares love to have these, as they fit my flashlightslove the usb charging, and it comes with the cables..so far, so good...value is good vs. the bigger brands...\n",
      "Rechargeable power These are rechargeable AA batteries that have a high capacity and have a long life. They are 1850 mAh for lasting power, and they have up to 1000 recharge cycles. That means that each of the batteries has the potential to replace 1000 AA batteries. Even if they last half of that, they will save 500 batteries from landing in the trash. This 4 pack could eventually replace 4000 AA batteries.They work exactly like any regular alkaline battery, providing long lasting performance and power to your devices. Once they lose power, simply connect them to the included USB charging cable, and in a little over an hour, they are ready for use again. Each battery has a micro USB port for recharging. They have a red LED indicator light  when charging, then turning green when done.  There is also a plastic storage box for keeping them organized and portable. The batteries carry a 3 year warranty, and Blacklube offers a 100% money back guarantee if they don't perform as expected. That shows confidence in a product. Together with all of the possibilities these batteries offer, they are a great value and I give them 5 stars.\n",
      "Very nice and works great I have another set of AA batteries designed this way but just a little different. I put them head to head and it was Basicly a dead heat on both sets. I'm rather surprised and happy about that. It even comes with a cord to charge all 4 at the same time, the other set doesn't.\n",
      "High quality rechargeable batteries... I've recently decided to get back into rechargeable batteries. We tried many years ago, but the tech was juts not there, they did not work all that well. We just go through so many batteries and I hate to think about them going into garbage. Sure not good for the environment.So I was happy to grab this set. They are also the first set of USB charging batteries, such a great idea. They came boxed well with a storage case for the batteries. I also love how you can charge all 4 at the same time, very handy. Helpful that have a light on the top so you know they are charging.Put them in a RC car my wife recently got me and they worked as batteries should. Only slight negative, it would be nice if they worked in a charger. Not a big deal. Can't have it both ways.Some might say they are expensive, but if they do charge 1,000 times, they are going to be well worth it. Plus all the regular batteries these keep from ending up in the trash.Overall, really happy with these. Will update this if anything changes. As of now, highly recommend.\n",
      "didn't work they didn't charge up correctly another useless product from china\n",
      "durable quality The quality of the battery is very good,very durable,and I especially like that it can be charged multiple times,It is environmentally friendly.\n",
      "A satisfying shopping sxperience Sellers deliver goods in a timely manner,and logistics is faster.Have a good service attitude,patient in answering questions,detailed answers,good quality,should last a long time .\n",
      "Awesome batteries I have never seen rechargeable batteries that can be charged with USB charger. That was an amazing invention. The kit comes with two  batteries and a usb cable with two heads. It would light up the blue indicator when charging and turn off the light when fully charged. Good product overall!\n",
      "Useful batteries, easy to charge. It's cool, as long as my kids don't lose them, they can last a long time.\n",
      "Amazing It doesn't need a charging dock to charge, just connect the USB cable to the battery port, and connect the other end to the power adapter or computer, or the power bank. This built-in port is really great. Of course, the battery life is also great.\n",
      "very easy to use powerful and very easy to use.the battery is lightweight and easy to use,and it charges quickly.when fully charged,my remote control can be used for a long time ,and the power is very strong and buzzing,much better than the disposable dry battery i bought before.\n",
      "Good for Flashlights but Not Radios Most of these no-name, never-heard-of batteries are rewrapped rejects from larger companies (mine are already coming unwrapped) that didn't meet their quality standards but they are still serviceable. I like having a micro usb port on the batteries to charge them, but you've got to watch the marketing. As of this writing, July 2020, Delipow is marketing these batteries as 2800mWh instead of mAh so that makes these about 1870mAh devices (1.5v × 1870mAh = 2805mWh). They aren't lying, but might catch some people off guard, they did me at first, but that was still plenty high enough for what I was buying these for so that didn't bother me too much. However, I will say that these are not good for radios. I bought these AA batteries for a cassette player/radio but they give off too much interference to pick up anything on the fm or am stations (a problem that is alleviated with alkaline or zinc chloride batteries), so now I'll be using these for flashlights or something instead. They're serviceable for the cassette side of things though and don't interfere with larger radios quite as bad so you're milage may vary, but for me I'll be looking for alternatives without the micro USB port (which I like for the AAA little brothers of these I bought for a penlight).\n",
      "Works well These batteries are really easy to recharge and use. They seem to work fine in any device. There is only one draw back. The total power that they can provide is similar to conventional batteries. This might be expected, since so much volume is used for the USB port being built in (instead of being dedicated to more battery).\n",
      "they work work goob\n",
      "rechargeable batteries Really super like, very support, very good quality, exactly as described by the seller, very satisfied, really like, completely beyond expectations, very fast delivery, very careful packaging, logistics company service attitude, fast delivery speed, very satisfied shopping.\n",
      "Perfect Charging time is very rapid. These last a noticeable amount longer. I would say nearly twice as long. I have replaced using disposable alkaline AA batteries with these.And the fact that they can be fed via an ordinary cable is a great feature.\n",
      "Great batteries Bought this recently for my Lenovo explorer controllers,the batteries work great for this and easily provide a full day of play time and charged through the night and full by morning. The included charger cord works great! all positives would recommend.\n",
      "Don't Buy! Very cheap made! only worked for I week. Went to charge for only the and time and the inside piece broke off and now I can't charge. had to throw it away because it was just a dead battery with no way to charge it! DISAPPOINTED!!\n",
      "Short life. DONT LAST LONG in game controller Bought for my VR Controllers that take 1 battery each, and out of the box of 4, only 3 lit up bright to charge, the other one lit dim and fastly died.... so maybe it's just that 1 right? Nope, they all die in a day or two normal gaming use...  the concept is cool, i love plug into usb to charge idea, but they JUST. DONT.  WORK. LONG ENOUGH>I'd say dro pyour money on the panasonic enloops -they got great reviews, NiMH so longer charge time, but if you want them to actually not die a lot while playing go with those... the black brand has the best reviews, probably my next buy. stupid batteries, why cant my controllers be rechargeable Oculus like my mouse and keyboard and cell phone and headphones.... why tf do i need batteries anyways ~~geez, ok rant over, but yea, these suck!\n",
      "nice battery i have used it for a while, it's really nice they designed it chargable as a USB device. I have used it in my wireless mouse for a long while, and it works just like a regular one but chargeable and safer. I would strongly recommend it than the traditional one.\n",
      "Couldn't provide enough power for my clock after a couple of days it was charged It doesn't hold the charge.\n",

      "Great for people on the go works just great ....the fact that if the battery goes dead i switch it with a regular battery ....while waiting about a hour and half recharge last s  3 to 4 weeks on my bluetooth key board and mouse great battery ..i hope this helps anyone else interested thanks\n",
      "Help Its save a lot of money for baby toy. And can charge easily\n",
      "Lasted about 6 months before they wouldn't charge These have a short life between charges, and out of an order of 4 batteries two of them lasted only about 6 months before they would no longer hold a charge.\n",
      "Fake The capacity is less than 400mAh for each battery.\n",
      "Recharge Option I like the usb option built with the battery....\n",
      "Doesn't last as long as alkaline, but at least I'm no longer throwing away batteries. I was tired of going through batteries to power my Magic Mouse and Trackpad, so I decided to give these a try.  I am writing this initial review at the end of the first discharge cycle.  These batteries lasted a little over a month in the mouse and trackpad, which don't get used daily.  I don't have an exact comparison with how long alkaline batteries lasted, but it feels like they lasted longer.  I suspect this is because these batteries have the charging circuitry built in, so there is less volume for the battery itself.  Still, they fulfill the objective of not wasting batteries and contributing to landfill waste, and they're easy to charge...no special charger needed.I'll also add that the battery percentage measurement is not at all helpful when using these batteries.  These batteries will output 100% with no drop in power right up until they quit.\n",
      "Batteries not good quality One of the batteries lights a very low blue while charging while the second battery is a bright blue. The charge on the first battery does not last at all in my maglight flashlight. About 30 seconds then dies. Maybe I got a bad battery. I dont know but I wont waste anymore money on this brand\n",

      "doesn't last long I only used them 3 times and one doesn't recharge any longer!! Not worth the money. Panasonic batteries are better.\n",
      "Revolutionary batteries.... These are pricey but I love the concept of not requiring a separate wall charger or needing 50/60Hz for travel.  Just charge these like your phone and desconnect when the charge light goes out.  Engenius.\n",

      "Recharged my batteries and the failed  to last. I liked the battery because once it was charged I put three of the batteries in my table light and it was a super bright light but didn't last very long. I turned it off for a while and when I turned it back on it was bright for about 10 seconds and then shut off again so I will try recharging them and see if improves.Ok, one of the three batteries how to load charge sorry we charge them all put them back in my lamp and tested it for an hour and it's working fine. I'll continue testing it every night to see how long they last.Update: I charged the batteries and put three of them and my small table light and the only lasted 1 hour and 11 minutes. Is this normal for these batteries, I hope not.\n",
      "Best chargeable batteries The perfect batteries for my TV remote. Easy to charge...love that it charges by USB instead of a wall charger. I've bought tons on rechargeable batteries and these are the best!\n",
      "absolute wasre of money!!!!! Do not buy this product!\n",
      "Excellent product! USB fast charging is just perfect! In my original order received 1950mWh batteries by mistake. Customer service was great, offering to send new 2800mWh and keep the 1950mWh as well. So far batteries are great with very fast charging time!\n",
      "Great Battery But One Thing That Could Be Issue Don't get me wrong about this product as of 5 stars quality. Number 1 reason why I will give you just only 4 Stars because the size in diameter is nearly 1mm. wider than standard AA throw away of one time use batteries. I had tried it in my Coleman brand LED flashlight that will take 6 of AA batteries in long barrel tube that I have to bang my flashlight to able get my stuck batteries out of my flashlight. So I still use this same batteries for my higher-powered walkie talkie that is 100% susceptible. So I had bought TENAVOLTS brand is very similar as this USB Lithium-Ion to 1.5 volt from primary 3.7 volt. At least TENAVOLTS AA battery will fit into my same LED flashlight.\n"

I hate having dead batteries in my calculator, my iclicker, my presenter, or anything else I have to carry in my backpack but now I can just take them out and put them into my phone charger. The light at the end shows when it's charged and they actually charge pretty fast. I'll update this review once I can tell if they last as long as alkaline batteries but for right now so far so good.\n",
      "Gets the job done. Works wonderful  just not so well in heavly used  items\n",
      "Fast recharge Was a bit sceptical about this product but after my Amazon basics rechargeable batteries started to not charge I figured I'd try something new and unique. I wanted to get a few charges in before my review. Overall I'm impressed they last as long as anyother rechargeable batteries I have used BUT the charge time is about half or less of the time of normal recharging batteries. Plus when you show people they are typically really surprised to see a micro USB plug in a AA battery witch is almost worth it by itself.\n",
      "Didn't know this is possible I always thought that charging rechargeable cell will need a charger and wall plug. This invention is seriously amazing!!! Rechargeable batteries with inbuilt charging. No need to carry any additional charger and look for a wall point. Just carry the USB cable and can be charged anywhere where USB is available like laptop, car or public places. Charges pretty fast and batteries do perform great.\n",
      "Best Rechargeable Batteries i ever bought. I bought them for my windows mixed reality controllers, last a long time before recharging again, will buy more in the future.\n",
      "Work and hold a charge! So for starters I have never bought batteries that charge with micro usb chargers. So I find these pretty awesome! They work, which I guess is mainly the point, I charged them when I first got them and they haven’t died yet, we use them for our Xbox remote. I like that they are micro usb chargers and it comes with the spliced charger so you can charge both together, but it does not come with a cube so just a heads up. Overall, I think they are adorable and work well!\n",
      "Awesome rechargeable batteries I just bought a wireless mac keyboard and need of rechargeable batteries. I found this cool batteries which looks like some sort of gadgets by itself. It comes with usb cable to charge the two batteries at same time. It charge quickly and give enough battery life. Awesome one.\n",
      "Great idea Rechargeable batteries without an awkward charging base. These fit into any device that uses standard AA batteries. They can easily be charged via USB. They perform very well.\n",
      "They came a long way I remember the days where you just toss the batteries out once their life span is up. Then came rechargeable batteries where there a bulky cradle you have to insert the batteries in and the cradle pretty much covered up your wall socket completely. Now...USB rechargeable batteries...ha! Genius! No more messing with bulky cradles and nowadays, I’d say 98% of electronics are USB rechargeable. Meaning the convenience of recharging your batteries without relying solely on a wall socket! It charges really fast. While charging there is a blue ring that lights up to let you know it’s charging. Once fully charged, the blue rings turn off. I’m using the batteries for my tv remotes and they’ve been working fine. Love the convenience of charging the batteries. Total recommend. 👍\n",

      "Very Impressive High Quality Rechargeable Batteries Seems that these battery are using the new technologies. I have tried to use so many rechargable batteries with different brand but this is the first time that i tried the rechargable battery using the micro USB cable and i got to say I am extremely impress. I like that I can recharge these batteries with the micro USB cable and they last longer & perform well in cold weather. The best thing about this is the fast charge capability that can charge the battery fast within 1 hour.\n",
      "Some work and some don't...... So these batteries haven't had the best reviews. For this reason I have held off on buying these until they showed up as a Lightning Deal two days ago. I own several other Blackube batteries and they are all great. So I figured for the Lightning Deal price I would give them a try.Unfortunately one of the four batteries was dead on arrival. The first three charged and worked no problem but the fourth would never light green from a full charge. So I used my battery tester on all four and one obviously doesn't work.I contacted Amazon Chat about the issue and they just gave me a full refund and told me I could keep the three that worked. I needed four to work for what I was going to use them for, but I guess I will hold onto the three for now.Again, other batteries from this company have worked great, but the AAAs just need better quality control I think.\n",

      "Great batteries! Love these batteries! Have bought 2 sets of AAA so far, one for work and one for home.\n",
      "Great investment Makes me feel good everytime I think about it. It was risky sincy they are so expensive. But I think they have already repaid me many fold in terms of reliability and performance. Holds charge longer than normal cells, recharges quickly.Maybe it's just me, but there seems to be a mechanism where it delivers full power or shuts down completely. I love it, because my mouse or remote doesn't slllooow down...\n",
      "If you thinking bout it just get it I use them strictly for my Xbox controller and they last a really long time and i mean a LONG TIME.But. The controller can't read how much charge it has so it always reads it as full battery and dies without warning.They charge in an hour but if you move them once they turn green they go back red but not for long. Idl if thats just my batteries or all of them but it really aint that big a deal.\n",
      "Great product, worth the investment. Absolutely incredible in my gaming mouse, no drop off at all, and the savings over time is huge. They recharge in a matter of an hour or two, and hold their charge very well.\n",
      "NOT for VR Capacity and cell longevity is trash, especially for the price. These batteries won't last 10 minutes in VR. Keep these in your TV remotes.\n",
      "Short life Less than 9 months the batteries do not hold their charge, after fully charged in a week they are drained when not in use.\n",
      "Not a bad idea, but some issues to be aware of I hope to find my initial review, as I was disappointed, but I wasn't aware one of the four AAA batteries didn't work on arrival.. I have 2 of them in my remote now, and they are working fine so far..When they get low, my Roku smart remote had wicked loud static coming through the headphones.I've got the 9V batteries as well, but haven't had anything to put them in just yet. probably put them in my alarm clock and Digital Multimeter..Will update later this year..\n",
      "Durable, steady and long-lived on a single charge I've had these batteries working for almost a year now in my sprinkler system timer. No problems. I've only recharged them twice. Durable and they hold the charge well.\n",
      "Could Just Be Mine BUT The Charge Cord Is Only Capable Of Charging Two Batteries At The Same Time I've noticed when charging the batteries that if I attempt to charge all four batteries at the same time, the lights will turn off, indicating a full charge but the batteries will not be fully charged, they'll die in less than half the time. I also know that the batteries aren't fully charged because I can plug them back in and the lights will turn back on and stay on for the same period of time. I have them connected to a 3a usb outlet, which must mean each battery would only be getting about 0.75a each, which should only mean a longer charge time, not a lower max charge.Otherwise the batteries, when fully charged, hold up well for around 6-8 hours before needing a recharge.Not much left to say about them. Great value for the quality, wish the charging cable or the internal charge chips were better.\n",
      "Trash Would not charge after first use  again and aa\n",
      "The real deal finally. You may think these are pricey but you get the real deal with these batteries. I have tried a number of others but the all left me wanting longer life on a single charge. The bad boys have the longevity I’ve been searching for and then some.I am buying these again right now because I have yet to recharge the first set a second time after running my kwikset zwave dead bolt for more than 6 months and it is still slamming that bolt so energetically it is still more power than the best brand new fresh standard battery.\n",
      "Bought for a GeeekPi Retroflag GPi Case I bought these to use with my GeeekPi Retroflag GPi Case, as that takes AA batteries. They work great and last longer than traditional AA batteries. They come with the charging cable to recharge all 4 at the same time.\n",
      "Mehhh.. Ok batteries but for the Price I expected them to last longer.Got 4 and barely used them and one doesn't work anymore.IFor almost $10ea they should last a couple years with moderate use. (I was using them in cordless shaver & cordless soldering iron)\n",
      "Only 3 out of 4 will charge I've purchased AA batteries from this seller and they all work great, but only 3 of the AAA batteries will hold a charge.\n",
      "trade offs with NiCD/NiMH I have a bunch of NiMH batteries. And for a lot of things they are fine. But you have to charge them in pairs. They take a long time to charge and they slowly fade away. Not great for devices that use 3 batteries. Or something that you need to supply with a constant high power. I bought a bunch of these for use in under cabinet lighting, and aquarium gravel vac, and my wireless weather station. The under cabinet lighting, just sucks batteries dry. And these are no different, in fact in that application they don't last nearly as long as alkaline or NiMH. But they do stay brighter longer. The gravel vac is the same situation. The fade of power made it frustrating to use. These are constant. Full suction all the time. If they do die, there's just no suction at all. It's a very clear indicator. And charging doesn't take 8 hours. plug these into a USB port and they are good in an hour or two. Finally, the weather station. It seems like those batteries are always freezing and dying or over heating and dying. These are less sensitive to temperature swings. And recharging 3 of these batteries is so much easier. I don't have to cycle them through the charger like I would the NiMHs. NiMHs don't like it when you pair a dead battery with a fully charged one. These don't care. You can charge 1 or 3 no problem.I'd love to see a longer run time but the charging convenience and steady power more than make up for their weaknesses.One thing I would really love to see is a double length battery. Basically 2x AA batteries permanently end to end. Thus you could maximize the capacity and reduce the regulation/charge circuitry. My gravel vac uses these and the under cabinet light could benefit from them as well.\n",

      "Great Customer Service!!! Loved the whole black appeal of this product, it was one of the reasons I purchased it and received a white cable... I was slightly disappointed; contacted customer support and they actually sent me the black cable. I was very pleased with the level of customer service and with the product itself. I wanted to purchase rechargeable batteries for my wireless mouse now that I am working from home due to COVID-19, and it’s definitely a product I can keep in my laptop bag. Thank you Blackube!\n",
      "Need improvement. The Idea is a good one, and for the most part it works... Until it doesn't... after a few recharges of these batteries the Controller chip begins to fail an releases a full 5V of power into whatever electronic device you have it loaded into. Subsequently Most sensitive electronic devices cannot handle the extra 3.5 Volts and fry up. I have a few damaged devices to prove it. One being a Wii remote. These are not high amp draw devices... I would advice caution when purchasing these Batteries.\n",
      "Purchased to convert a Flashlight to USB rechargeable. These batteries are a compromise that reduces available capacity for the ability to recharge via any standard USB port. Make sure you know what you are getting before purchase, but they are pretty good if you understand the pros and cons.They hold less than standard rechargeable batteries, but you can use any common Micro USB. One thing I haven't seen mentioned is that you don't strictly need to use their 4-to-1 cable—regular cables work fine.I work somewhere where I need a small flashlight often, but not for that long at each use. I wanted to be able to pop out the battery and recharge it at my desk using the cables I already have. The constant 1.5V instead of the 1.2V NiMH gives you will provide a slightly brighter flashlight with a more consistent output.\n",
      "Good stuff. These are awesome but why not USB-C\n",
      "recommend Bought it for my son, as he has a lot of different toys which need batteries to be changed quite often. I am very happy with this batteries, as my son said that the batteries last much longer than the previous ones, so he is very happy with this ones. I like also the fact that they can be charged for up to 1000 times, which is just great and will save a lot of money. Also it is great that the batteries are environmental friendly, what can be better. Would definitely recommend. Great value for money and help to save even more!\n",
      "Camera battery Good battery\n",
      "Great value, portability great product. I use these for my oculus touch controllers and they are great. They are li-ion so they don't lose voltage like other rechargeable batteries as their power gets drained. They're also super portable since they come with a 4way USB charging cable and not a bulky charger. I can store it with my carrying case.\n",
      "So good so far! So far so good! Put these in my keyless door locks. Been going through a lot of batteries for some reason lately so these should do the trick!\n",
      "Great for remotes or anything Loved how fast and long they last the only thing is pretty hard to put the charger\n",
      "AWESOME!! 1.5V in a rechargable cell!! First of all, this is my second pack of these because they are WAY better than NiMH!!  NiMH take a special charger, don't charge nearly as fast as 1.5 hours, and many of my NiMH AA and AAA cells have eventually failed after only a few years and not many charges.  I rated these after getting my first set of four and I am still extremely pleased with them and recommend them 100%\n",

      "Recommended item. Could be a bit more powerful.\n",
      "Fast to charge (good), fast to self-discharge (bad) I've been using these batteries in a digital voice recorder for about nine months.Pros:-charges really fast, like 30 minutes from empty to full-doesn't need a bulky charger. I use the same 5v 1A power supply that came with my phone.Neutral, but important:-provides a constant 1.5v supply. I think this results in inaccurate remaining capacity readings. My voice recorder determines the battery's remaining capacity by looking at its voltage, and since the voltage stays at a constant 1.5v even right before they die, the battery icon will always show a full charge even when it's just about to die. I can't tell you how many times I've used my voice recorder just for it to die all of a sudden. I never know what the battery's true remaining capacity is, so I charge them whenever I can. I think it would be a really good idea if the manufacturer put a little lcd display on these batteries that constantly show the remaining capacity because you might not be able to trust the built-in battery meter if your device has one.Cons:-self-discharges really fast, even if you don't use them. I tried using them in my Roku remote control, but it's such a hassle because they run out of power so fast. I found myself needing to recharge these like once a week, and I use the remote for maybe a total of a minute a day (turn on TV, adjust volume, pick a movie, turn off TV). Stick with alkaline or low-self-discharge NiMH if you're thinking of using these in remotes. They will not be good.I probably won't buy USB-rechargeable batteries again unless a) they self-discharge much slower and b) they came with an LCD to show the remaining charge.\n",
      "Good if used within 2 days from charge The item does not hold a charge pass 2days. Works well if used within two days\n",
      "Great They work great for my oculus quest controllers.\n",
      "They will last 1 charge and then die and not recharge again. I bought them to repalce the 4 triple A batteries of my hand held VHF radio.They charged nicely the first time, but once the were low, I pull them out to recharge and out of the 4 only 2 recharged and the other 2 never got any charge and the charging light never lit, despite 4 attempts to charge then.And I know that the charger works because the other 2 did lit and charge.Don't Buy this.\n",

      "Travel saver I bought these AA cells for a very specific reason; I did not want to have to travel with another charger for AA cells besides the USB multiport charger I always pack for phones, tablets, etc. These cells with builtin charging circuitry fit this need with an important side benefit, they weigh almost a 1/3 less than regular AA batteries. However, the capacity a 6% less at 2.25Wh (1.5Ax1.5V) versus 2.4Wh for a 2000mAH NiMH battery that operates at 1.2V.You do need to provide your own 10W charger, as each cell will draw 2.5W. Besides the 4 cells, a USB-A to four microUSB plug power cable is provided. The cable is only 6\" long, so if you plug this cable into a 2A charger, and the charger into most receptacle, the cells will not touch the floor. However, any appropriate USB power cable and charger should work. Please note, if you use the provided power cable, it only supports charging and all the connections are in parallel. I will probably use that cable when I travel despite its short length, since my multiport charger has a long power cable.\n",

      "So glad I bought these The price is good and the quality is great.  They fully charge in about 10 minutes maybe less and last longer than any AA’s I’ve ever had. Now I dont have to buy AA’s again for a long long time, which is a relief because I’m broke and batteries are f***ing expensive..\n",
      "These batteries don't have the power of a normal battery At a full charge, these batteries aren't as powerful as a normal battery. I was very excited to have rechargeable USB batteries, but once first turned on, they don't have enough power to operate a toothbrush.\n",

      "Worth every penny. After getting an Oculus Rift S I went through batteries really fast. I figured out it didn't actually drain much power from alkaline batteries but demands very full batteries to function. I knew normal rechargable ones wouldn't give it enough juice to run. These would last about 4 times longer than Amazon alkaline batteries and if the statement is true about number of recharges, they will more than pay for themselves 100 times over.

      "Use cases more limited than I expected I bought 4 of the 1700mah AAs due to their supposed ability to handle a greater current than the 1500mah ones.The devices I intended to use them in are: 1) a \"spinbrush\" toothbrush that needs two AAs; 2) a micro-touch hair trimmer that needs one AA.The results in the spinbrush were disappointing. Using two freshly charged Blackubes, the device's motor sputtered on and off, and wouldn't spin the brush at all if any resistance was placed on the brush (e.g., if I put the brush against my teeth). I had to go back to my Eneloop NiMH batteries for the brush as they can handle the device fine (though when voltage drops to the 1.25 range the brush speed is slow for my liking which is why I liked the idea of the constant 1.5v discharge of the Blackubes).In the micro-touch trimmer, the device seems to run OK with the Blackube battery. The motor has noticeably more speed due to the 1.5v discharge than an Eneloop at its normal 1.2-ish range.I don't know if there's something unique about the spinbrush's electronics that challenges the Blackubes, but I expect I'll use the ones I bought in remote controls that are picky for higher voltages and in the micro-touch trimmer.I'm disappointed that these aren't able to spin the head of the toothbrush. I'd be wary of buying them for anything motorized.\n",

I plan on using these in small electronics projects (like Arduino).The milliamp-hours (mAh) varied between them upon arrival, so be sure to charge each one before using them.  I wish I had seen the 1700 mAh option earlier - I would have liked to have the extra 800 mAh.  Oh well ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n",
      "Does exactly what it says, works well. I started using these instead of the NiMH rechargeables and they are a considerable improvement.  They'll need a lot more charging cycles for me to comment on value for money, but it's noticeable when using motorized devices that you are getting full alkaline-style behavior thanks to the full 1.5V delivery.\n",

Too messy to be used in sensitive electronics that were too cheap to put a capacitor in the incoming power circuit.  ie. Motion detectors. However, they work just fine in most of my applications including 1AAA gearlights.  HOWEVER...after about 3 charges, one of these has just failed today.  The light went out, I put it on charge but both the green and the red lights were on at once...I though Uh Oh...sure enough, the battery is not dead, but the electronics have failed.  I would have given these 4 stars if not for this loss.  Sure, I could probably RMA the whole pack of 4, sacrificing 3 good batteries to replace the one dead one..but I HATE doing crap like that.

They worked well, but not long, like many Li ion polymer batteries. I can live with that since they are rechargeable. The major downfall is that after 10 months of use, one battery will no longer charge. The red charge light never goes off and the battery fails in a short time rendering the mouse hungry for more. This still appears to be an emerging technology.\n",

I put several into remote controls, a computer mouse, and one in a travel toothbrush holder that has a UV light that kills bacteria.

Packed them up, took them to my destination, put them in the camera, the camera turned on literally only long enough for me to program in the month and the day, not even the year.  I'd say less than 60 seconds.  So I plugged them in to charge again.  Both times waiting for a complete charge - nothing.  I thought at first it could be a problem with my camera.

      "This Blackube AA 1500mAH worked in my EDC Searching for a 3.5 volt USB rechargeable AA battery for my LED flashlight.  I know the high end flashlight brands that have their own 14500 batteries but thought I'd try these.  They do work even on \"high\" or \"turbo\" setting.  Did not have any luck with the Blackube 1700mAH grey colored batteries.  On high or turbo the light shuts off and I tried them in several flashlights.  So I'm tempted to believe the battery shut off due to excessive drain.  It's odd these 1500mAH batteries work.  Maybe someone with more knowledge can help me understand that.  I joke that one of the reasons I purchased these Blackube batteries is for the USB charging cable with four outputs.\n",
      "Failed after first use (all 4 cells) All four cells failed after first use. Installed these in two battery-operated candles which contain timers that turn candles on for 5 hours and then off for 19 hours. Noticed that both of the candles were out after several weeks. When I measured their voltage, all were at or near 0 volts. Tried to recharge all cells using the supplied 4-output charger, but all cells did not accept a charge after 12+ hours and a second attempt. Neat idea, but in reading other reviews, I'm not the only one experiencing similar/identical problems. Amazon needs to investigate numerous failures of this product and'or suspend all future sales until problems are corrected!\n",
      "Not For Your EDC Flashlight This review is for the High Output Li-ion 1.5 volt/1700mAH battery.  The gray ones.

My light is a small Utorch \"UT01\" and works well with the Fenix ARB-L14-1600IU usb rechargeable cell.  But this Blackube 1700mAH shuts off when I attempt the turbo mode.  Works with all other output settings even strobe and SOS but not Turbo.  I must admit the four output USB charging cable is worth the purchase alone.UPDATE:  So I installed these 1700mAH batteries to my Delta kitchen faucet with \"motion sensors\".  It takes six Alkaline batteries but I don't like throwing away all those Alkaline batteries.  So far these Blackube 1700mAH batteries are working properly.  I'd also suspect they will work in door locks that have small motors.  I did try these Blackube batteries in a couple other LED flashlights and observed the same behavior.  The internal electronics shut off the current when I attempted the \"high\" mode or \"turbo\".\n",

      "Good 1.5V batteries for voltage picky devices I have been wanting to get something like these for a while and they work great for my use case. You may ask, why would anyone pay $10 for a single AA cell? Why wouldn't you just get a cheaper NiMH cell and call it a day? The answer to this is simple: There are devices I own that are just not designed to operate at lower voltages. When I go on business trips, two things really matter to me -- my portable water flosser and my wireless mouse for my laptop. Problem with NiMH is that while it is fully charged at 1.5V, their voltages quickly drop down to the 1.25-1.3V range soon after they are being used or have been sitting around for a while. This means a much weaker pressure on my water flosser and a choppy Bluetooth connection for my wireless mouse. Charging my NiMHs every so often has gotten to be such a chore that I have decided I would pay up for these cells instead which can keep a consistent voltage over time.Although the concept of lithium-ion USB AA cells is not new (there are plenty out of products out there), this is one of the highest rated capacities that can be found on Amazon. All of these cells work by enclosing a lithium-based battery inside an AA enclosure and using a small chip built into the + terminal of the battery to convert and regulate the output voltage. The circuit also regulates charging and the discharging of the built-in lithium battery to prevent over(dis)charging.Here are my thoughts on these batteries:Style/Design: These look exactly like your traditional AA batteries, with the exception that there is a built-in micro USB port on top of each battery (as opposed to other designs that have this on the side). The battery seems sturdy and in one piece. It does not appear that it would suffer from the drop issue that other designs face with the circuitry falling off when dropped. There is also a charging indicator light that turns red when the battery is being charged and turns off when the charging is complete. The enclosed 4-in-1 cable is quite handy so you can simply use one cable to charge 4 batteries at once without having to use a USB hub or 4 separate cables.Weight: Since lithium-based batteries have higher energy densities, the battery is significantly lighter when compared to a 2,400mAh LSD NiMH. One of these cells weighed 20g while the NiMH based cell weighed 29g.Voltage Stability Under Load: When the batteries are not subject to a load, they measure around 1.51-1.53V. When placed under load, the voltage drops are as follows:250mA: 1.46V500mA: 1.41V750mA: 1.38V1A: 1.34V1.25A: 1.30V1.5A: 1.24V1.75A: 1.22V2A: 1.20V2.15A: 1.18VBeyond ~2.2A, the current limiter kicks in and no further increase in current is possible, even in the case of a short circuit. When measured with a multimeter under a short-circuit condition, the maximum acquired current was 2.21A. I am not quite sure how the manufacturer was able to achieve 4A of current on these cells, but it is possible that they were testing a set of 2 batteries being operated in parallel.Compared to an LSD NiMH cell, voltage drops on these batteries are steeper in the short term, however, these cells can provide approximately the same voltage until the whole cell is depleted (i.e. until the under-voltage protection IC kicks in for the lithium cell).Discharging Test: A discharge test was done for these batteries under 2A, 1A, 500mA, and 250mA conditions. The results are as follows:2A: Runtime: 44m 35s - Capacity: 1,485mAh (87.35%) - Power: 1,904mWh (74.67%)1A: Runtime: 1h 34m 20s - Capacity: 1,573mAh (92.53%) - Power: 2,210mWh (86.67%)500mA: Runtime: 3h 15m 28s - Capacity: 1,615mAh (95%) - Power: 2,362mWh (92.63%)250mA: Runtime: 6h 22m 45s - Capacity: 1,584mAh (89.49%) - Power: 2,216mWh (86.90%)It seems like the converter was the most efficient when the current draw was around 500mA when both the capacity and the power ratings have a 90+% match compared to the numbers on the label. The voltage was fairly consistent through all the current tests and does not \"curve\" downward like traditional batteries as they are being discharged. Instead, the battery experiences an abrupt drop to zero voltage when the cell is depleted (shut off due to the under-voltage protection IC kicking in for the built-in lithium cell battery). Because the voltage stays constant throughout the whole discharge cycle, it is not possible to gauge battery capacity based on the terminal voltage (it will always read around 1.51-1.53V when measured without load, or 0V when depleted).Charging Test: Charging these batteries using my battery pack, which outputs a USB voltage of around 5.3V, the charging process took 1h 55m. This was quite on point with quoted 2h timeframe from the manufacturer (the charging time may be closer to 2h exactly for USB power sources that are lower than 5.3V, although the difference would most likely be nominal). The charging process was split into two phases, a constant-current phase which drew a constant current of about 0.42A, and a constant-voltage phase as the lithium cell becomes full. The constant-current phase lasted 1h and 30m and the constant-voltage phase continued for another 22m until the current was cut off once the USB charging current reached 50mA (the charging light turns off at this point).When charging 4 batteries at once using the same cable, the current may approach 1.7A during the constant-current phase. This may cause some problems when charging from the computer USB's port since even the USB 3.0 spec only allows up to 900mA of current for unconfigured devices (newer DCP ports allow 1.5A of current). To avoid overcurrent issues, it is best to charge all 4 batteries using a charger that has at least 2A of available power.Ripple Test: Since the battery uses a converter chip to convert the internal voltage from the nominal voltage of 3.7V down to 1.5V, it impacts a ripple \"fluctuating\" voltage on the battery output terminals. When the battery was not under any load, the ripple was 12.17Hz @ 27.60mV Vpp (most likely in power saving PFM mode). Putting the battery across a 5Ω resistor (~300mA current) resulted in a different ripple pattern that was of higher frequency that was 1.023Mhz @ 12.60mV Vpp. This level of ripple is low and should not be problematic for devices running on these batteries.Shelf-Life: Since this battery relies on a converter chip that is always-on, it will use a minuscule amount of power to perform this conversion even when no load is attached. Assuming the chip draws about 25µA of power when there is no current load, the battery should last about 3 years before it is fully depleted. This should not be a problem if the batteries are actively being used and recharged, although letting the batteries sit idle without being charged for 3 or more years may result in irreversible cell damage (I assume that's why the manufacturer stated that the service life is 3 years). Devices that draw a small ghost load may kick the battery out of the power saving mode and lead to faster energy depletion. That being said, the cell will most likely run out of energy due to this load much quicker than this quiescent load.Overall, these batteries are great. Although they are much more expensive than other batteries out there, they serve my purposes quite well and I am very happy with them. For high current applications though, using NiMH cells may be more appropriate since they have higher energy overall, cheaper, and can easily tolerate 5A or more of current.\n",
      "Long lasting charge. Used it for my mini work flashlight.\n",
      "Expensive but work well Considering that you are paying about the same for 4 batteries as you are for a 100 pack of AA alkaline cells, there needs to mitigation to justify the expenditure. I use these for my Apple wireless keyboard and trackpad. They are always ready to switch out and perform well  for low-drain applications. My guess is that high-drain application such as a flashlight might not work well. For me it is the convenience and need to not dispose of multiple spent batteries into landfills.\n",
      "***These batteries do not hold a charge as long as they claim to *** I am giving these batteries 1 Star because they DO NOT do what they claim. If it were just one, then maybe. But all four do not live up to the claims of hourly usage. Not only that, but if used in a gaming controller, the batteries do give you 100% output until they just die out, without warning. They do not last nearly as long as they claim to, so, if using in a gaming controller, you may as well use NI-MH batteries that seem to have the same amount life from charge to discharge, plus the added bonus of slowly losing charge, so you are not left out there.\n",
      "As advertised... I'm hoping that these will have a more steady discharge curve than typical alkaline rechargeables. And also no memory effect. If they made a cell that would have 2500mAH I would have preferred those, but these seem the best choice from what I could find. The packaging is well done, there was a case for the batteries and the charging cable seems sturdy. Fortunately, these have a BMS to handle nearly any charger that is close to specification.\n",
      "They work great. I really dig these batteries.  I am very happy with them.\n",
      "Nice idea, bad execution Really looked forward to this product, three batteries were good but one of the four batteries never charged. 48hrs on the charger and a red light the whole time. I finally took it off the charger cause I was starting to worry about a short or fire. I tried contacting the company as indicated on the paper in the box, a week later and I haven't heard from them, but I did get a link to review the product. I gave two stars because you may have the best world-changing product, but if your support sux then your product is worthless. I will be returning them shortly.\n",
      "AM radio band may not work These are great for flashlights, remote controls, Blink Cameras etc. However if installed in an AM/FM radio the AM band will not work. I tried 3 different radios. These batteries have an internal DC-DC buck converter which drops the Li Ion 3.7VDC to 1.5 VDC. The converter uses a high frequency signal which generates EMI & overloads the AM receiver front end. FM works fine since it is less susceptible to noise.\n",
      "Works, but not much power.  Waste of money! The AAA version of this product is inferior to every rechargeable AAA battery I've ever encountered.  At 600mva, this battery is outperformed by even standard alkaline batteries.  This item is garbage.  All you are paying for is the ability to recharge them with a USB cable, which you will be doing ALL THE TIME.  I thought \"lithium ion\" meant something.  Apparently it does not to this manufacturer.  Do not waste your money.  You have been warned!\n",
      "Great for boats I replaced all of the disposable and rechargeable batteries on my sailboat...for instruments, GPS, flashlights, etc. with these batteries. I've bought several sets because they are so useful.\n",
      "Dead after about 2 recharges. Seemed to be working great at first. After about 2-3 charges, they died completely. Do not buy.  I'm going to give Eneloops a try next.\n",
      "Great battery for the money These batteries are great. They last quite a long time. I have been looking for something that will last a while and be rechargable for my smart vents. The duracells I had been buying were expensive and only were lasting 6 months so far these have been in use for 3 months and have been working great. I have no doubt they will last at least 3 more months and then some. I have had no issues with power draw and my vents have been working great.\n",
      "Excellent EXCELLENT\n",
      "Worth buying Long lasting and good quality.\n",
      "What’s not to like Wow. Where have these things been all my life? So much easier than your standard rechargeable batteries. Will be ordering some more for myself and as gifts.\n",
      "Great Great love them\n",
      "Houston we have a problem Not sure what's wrong with them but they wont work with my flashlight or headlamp (the only reason I purchased these batteries to begin with). The light will turn on but the light is extremely dim, like not even half  as bright as it should be. Need to contact seller. Will update with outcome.\n",
      "I love it I love it so much I bought a second set\n",
      "cannot hold charge too long cannot hold charge too long\n",
      "Convinient So far so good, using it for low current draw (thermostats & remote control). Holding charge well, easy to charge too. Description had no full image of the USB type charger, but I can confirm it charges all 4 batteries at once.\n",
      "Best ever ! I love these types of batteries !It’s a “No brainer”, why would you EVER buy reg. Batteries again ????They even come with a multi port charging cable. Which I now call Medusa !\n",
      "Durability Look great have not used yet but like the new charging concept!! Remote control??\n",
      "You will take them for granted, and that's a good thing. Purchase price: $23.25 with applied promotion (4 AA batteries total)Seller: BlackubePurchase date: October 2018Before making the purchase, I checked and this was the one with the legitimate best reviews.  It also had the matching premium price.If you have a battery operated device you use every day that can use these, then these are the ones to get.  Everything about them is decent quality or better right down to the box they come in.  The band for the wires is even worth keeping.  There are some small improvements that I will recommend, however.The plastic box that the batteries come in could be made with space for the wires so that one could no longer need the cardboard box.  This way if someone was to travel they would have a pretty good case to keep everything together neat and compact.  Also the elderly and those that are fine motor skills impaired with their hands may benefit from a charging option that uses more gross motor skills.  By no means am I saying to get rid of the wire option, just something for the manufacturer to think about as an additional option or potential accessory.That's it, if I have any issues and I remember this review then hopefully I will update.\n",
      "Rechargeable batteries I tried two four battery sets. Neither set would take a charge no matter what power source I tried. Very poor product.  Do not buy.\n",
      "how much time I can get out of the charged batteries before they need recharging. I was looking for alternatives to continuing to purchase regular batteries.  I have a pretty good idea how long I can get out of these batteries right now;  I was hoping to get a little more.  However, knowing the amount of time running with these prior to having to recharge helps.  I'm considering getting more to help out.  I use them for a ministry I'm a part of, & also at our church, for the mic's for the \"praise & worship\".So far, they are working good for our purposes.Richard\n",
      "product is solid Bought these as replacements for the batteries in Xbox controllers as my son goes through them very quickly.  They popped right in and lasted over a month on the first try.  Love the 4 adapter charging cable that comes with the batteries but would love to have it be about 4 inches longer.  Happy with the purchase.\n",
      "Pays for themselves in no time. These batteries will save you money vs buying lithium ion batteries from the store. Charging is very convenient because a usb charging cord is included and allows you to charge all 4 batteries at the same time. I use these batteries for my outdoor Blink XT wireless cameras and they last nearly as long as the Energizer lithium batteries.\n",
      "Do not have to buy batteries Use these batteries in weather temperature sensors work great do not last as long regular batteries but I do not have to buy batteries ever 6 months\n",
      "Quality Product Quality Product.  I’m happy with the purchase and pleased with the performance!\n",
      "Buy it! Lasts a long time! Awesome batteries\n",
      "No more regular batteries So easy. I'm loving it! I use with my blink camera and is working very well\n",
      "Tons of power!  Don't drop them. I love these but you have to baby them some.  I opened the first set I got, dropped them, and one of the batteries' bottoms popped right off, making it useless.  I returned them for another set and was very careful with them.  I think as long as I don't drop them, I'll be good.  They are clearly supplying fantastic voltage to my smart deadbolt.  You can really hear the difference when it opens or closes.  I have had zero issues with it locking like I've had with any other type of battery, even alkalines.\n",
      "Having Li-Ion AAA size batteries available is a great option for many uses better than NiMh or NiCd So far these are performing as expected.  I enjoy the convenience of USB charging with no additional equipment required to bring like NiCd and NiMh technologies.  You can charge at home, travel, car, camping (with solar USB options)There are two main advantages to these cells if you need AAA rechargeable.- very low self-discharge rate so using them long term in clocks or remote controls where you have low power use over a long time.  These perform very well.  Because of the low self-discharge, it also stores well and only needs recharging 6-12 months later.  Other technologies would be long dead by then.- constant 1.5v for equipment that does not run well on the 1.2v rechargeable cells.the things to be aware of- they die suddenly without the normal dimming of regular cells.  not a bid deal in many situations but not great for other situations where you need warning- lower rated capacity than non-rechargeable and NiCd or NiMh cells.  Because of the low self-discharge rate of these cells, they will still beat other rechargeable cells because other cells lose charge that you can't use due to self-discharge- no rechargeable cell will beat a non-rechargeable cell.  don't set that expectation.I wanted to buy more of these but the seller had a 1 per order limit.\n",
      "Charges up real quick, no waiting around. I use my rechargeable batteries for my digital camera, which seems to eat up batteries for lunch. It was costing me a fortune in purchasing batteries. Now, I just use 2 of these batteries in my camera and when they need to be replaced, I just grab the other 2 batteries that are all charged up and ready for use. Then just charge up the 2 dead ones. Easy as pie. I love these batteries WITH the USB charging system. Even a real genius- like myself- can figure it out, simply. Real nice!!!\n",
      "Works for WMR VR controllers Had no problem using them all day in VR. They never make the controller go into low power mode, so you always have the best tracking possible. Plug them into the charger after you're done and they're good to go for the next day.\n",
      "usb port!!!!! recently we got the chance to test out the blackube 2550 mWh AA usb rechargable Li-ion batteries, even though we havent gotten a chance to run all the tests i must say im already in love with them. first and foremost the number one thing that really sold me on this product was the micro usb port for recahrge! this makes all the difference in the world for me, not haveing to carry the special spring loaded clip charges or worry about loseing it or a wall outlet has made this a joy to bring out in the field to fly rc. its a common cord we almost all have and more places then not to plug a full size usb in these days then a wall outlet for most of us. ok lets talk charge speed and battery life, as far as charge speed they seem to average at 87% faster then two different sets of 1770mAh AA that we ran them with!!! this is a huge increase in speed especially sense they where put next to a much smaller mAh. now as far as used lifespan we are still running a few more tests and will post again when they are done. that being said the results that have been gathered are very promising, a single AA in a minimed medtronic diabetic pump is currently running at 45% remain after 15 days of use!!!! this is often paired with a stomach censor increaseing the draw. normally its every few days to two weeks max before its time for a new one or a recharge. this looks like it will come closer to once a month :) secondly we tried these with a few rc transmitters putting them in at full then after 8 hours use pulled them to check V. this was done on a Dxe Dx8, afer the dxe day we still had 93% after the dx8 day we had 87% makeing them about even sense the dx8 has a display screen that its also powering. although i still want to finish and run a couple tests i can say after two weeks of use these have quickly become my favorite and new go to for AA batteries. between use in rotary tools, lights, air pumps and everything else this has saved some headake in the struggle to keep all our devices powered and last.big thank you to blackube for sending these to us to test out, as a company i personally have not had one complaint in dealing with them, always a quick and friendly response, nice to see these days :)\n",
      "Works great Save money\n",
      "Holds 1.5V charge for a long time I use these for VR controllers and they're awesome, NiMH batteries always showed as low very fast and then stop working consistently but these last and last\n",
      "Produced a lot of noise in audio device. Bought them to use with my Walker's Bluetooth earmuffs, the amount of noise produced by the driver in the battery makes them unusable. As that is my primary use for AAA batteries, I now have 4 more or less useless batteries.\n",
      "Decent Lithium rechargeables, but not quite compelling unless you NEED low temp stability I like how easy these are to charge, but they take a long time to top off and don’t have the greatest capacity. Unlike NiMH batteries, they don’t drop voltage as they run low, but when they run out, they go from full output to zero very quickly. Depending on your use, this could be acceptable or it could be problematic. They did stay charged well in sub-zero temperatures, which is usually a problem with traditional rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "... Works great last’s long\n",
      "Convenience is king. I purchased these batteries after seeing them in a video and having my mind blown, I use them for my Xbox One controllers and they work perfectly. They're convenient and last roughly 30-40 hours in the controller.  When I purchased them they had a coupon making it a better deal, I'm thinking of buying more for my flashlight. Not sure what else to say, only reason I'm writing this review is because Amazon offered a gift card for an honest review. I like them.\n",
      "Good batteries but they cannot be charged the traditional way. I like the batteries, but I wish they make them in a way that they can charge by being on a cradle. For example, I was hoping to use them in my home phone, which uses 2 AAA batteries, and they recharge when I put the handset on the cradle. The ones that came with the phone were not holding a good charge.\n",
      "Good life and noodles I use these for my xbox controller. They seem to last about 24 hours of play so life is good. Downfall is they go from full charge to dead there is no in between. Happy with purchase.\n",
      "Haven't used these batteries yet I can't really rate this product yet as 1) this is the 1st tiem I've purchased this battery, and 2) I've not used these batteries as of this writing.\n",
      "Didn't last Lasted two weeks and one of the batteries almost exploded.\n",
      "It no longer works I used a couple of times and it no longer holds charge. Disappointing.\n",

      "Only 50% carry a charge I have completed using all four batteries supplied.  All four were charged, one was dead and could not hold a charge.  The second lasted 2 days, the third was 5 days and the fourth was 5 days.  I recharged all four and the same issue occurred.  I use the batteries for an insulin pump that recommends lithium Batteries be used.  I cannot recommend a product that has a success rate this low.\n",

      "Not so great battery life. Just to keep things straight. It is cheaper than the other li - ion batteries you can find. And cost per mAh is also lower than other batteries. But then, when it comes to performance. it sucks bad, i mean really bad. A 43 dollars  4 pack batteries lasted on my torch light for continuous 8 hours. but this one just for 3 or so hours. its convenient to charge, but thats about it for this batteries. Not a good choice for power use.\n",
      "Good product I bought them to see how well they work. We go through a lot of batteries in the house. I like them better than other rechargeable batteries because you don't need the big charger base.\n",

      "Batteries for life These are really cool.  Great for travel. Should have bought a long time ago.\n",
      "Quick charging with steady voltage Just getting started using these batteries but they charged up quickly (less than 2 hours). They have provided steady voltage to my 5v device and have been reliable. Can't comment on their long term use yet.\n",
      "Finally Li ion AA Batteries Awesome I love these batteries, I have been waiting along time for Li ion aa & aaa batteries.These batteries work great and the best part is they came with a cable to charge them (bonus)Thank you so much for producing them.Pete B.\n",

      "Failed to light flashlight. Got these primarily to use with my favorite three-mode, zoom, AAA flashlight.  Unfortunately, the light doesn't function with these Blackubes.  Light works well with NiMH (EBL) rechargeable as well as with Li-Ion (Energizer) non-rechargeables, but flashes for a split second and dies on Blackubes.Most devices are designed to operate at 1.5V and these Blackubes are 1.5V.  The alternative rechargeable is NiMH 1.2V, 25% less than Li-Ion and Alkaline.  But voltage is only half the story, Ampacity (or Amp-capacity) is the other half.  The power (energy) of a battery is Volts x Amps.  Most devices operate in a band of voltage (e.g. 0.9V -- 1.7V), so a battery that starts at 1.5 might be expected to operate better over it's wider usable voltage range?Energy calculated from published specs:  Volts  AmpHr  Energy  Diameter  1.5V  0.6 Ahr  0.9 Whr  0.399\"  Blackube AAA  - *Failed to light flashlight  1.2V  1.2 Ahr  1.4 Whr  0.403\"  EBL AAA  1.5V  1.2 Ahr  1.8 Whr  0.405\"  Energizer Ult AAABut this chart doesn't tell the whole story.  First, Blackube fails to light the flashlight, so it's useless.  But, let's assume Blackube fixes their battery and someday functions properly?  It's still low on the energy chart.  Better voltage, but worse Ampacity.  Knew this going in, but wanted to test the spec'd better voltage range to see whether those extra 0.3V at the top added more operating headroom?There are also advantages to charging from a standard USB.  EBL NiMH require a charging station, weighing several ounces.  Blackube requires only a few-gram standard USB cable.  This alone could make Blackube worth carrying - if they lit the flashlight?It should be noted the flashlight operates at 70mA on the other two battery's, regardless input voltage (above 0.9V).  There is an unused high-mode at 150 mA and an unused flashing mode at 70mA (which surely pulses 150 mA at 50% duty-cycle).  Blackube failed in these unused modes as well.\n",
      "Very convenient. Be careful not to lose the caps. USB ports are everywhere and always easy to find which is what makes these so convenient. No need to carry a seperate charger. The red light on the battery turns to green when fully charged which takes all the guess work out of it. They seen to hold a good capacity charge and recharge quickly.  The magnetic caps are helpful, but my concern is they can easily be lost. Not much holding them onto the battery when being stored or in use, and only a weak magnet holding them to the battery when being charged. If your careful about this,  these batteries are great and I intend to order more.\n",
      "Neat These things are awesome, especially for the price. The included USB cable can charge all four batteries at once. My favorite feature is that these charge by microUSB, which are chea and easy to acquire, vs. an actual battery charger.\n",
      "No Bueno They are unstable and do not work as described.\n",
      "Not a good replacement for alkaline batteries I've only had them for a few days and already they have disappointed. The good: they're nice looking batteries and come with a handy 4-prong USB charging cord. The bad: after charging them, they (a) failed to power up a camera that works fine on regular AAs and (b) overheated in an LED flashlight. Right now they are hot and bulging - seem hazardous although maybe this is normal somehow? Anyway, I won't be buying these again.\n",
      "Rechargable batteries? Got these batteries for my Blink cameras. So far they are doing their job. I thought it was an odd design for the adaptor for charging was on the side of the battery. Uses what I would call a phone charging cord split into four wires. But they do charge quickly and hope they will last.\n",
      "Great Product! I just received these batteries last week.  I have been using them in a VR Controller for my Samsung Odyssey.  The controllers use a lot of battery power.  An Alkaline battery will not last more than five or six hours.  I bought Lithium batteries which last a whole lot longer, but are very expensive.  Giving these a try and so far they have held up pretty good.  They charge very, very fast.  They seem like great technology.Update....I have not had to change the batteries yet in my VR controllers.  After about 40 hours of use in my Xbox controllers, I needed to recharge.  That is incredible.  Wish I had more money, I would buy more of these batteries.  They are great!\n",
      "Good batteries So far these batteries work great. They last a good while on a single charge in my Xbox one controller. The only issue I see is the Xbox cannot tell the battery level and I run into them just dying. not too big of a deal since I have the other close by.\n",
      "Easy to use and recharge I a m not sure if all the batteries are charging fully, but the devices I use them in indicate a 75% charge.  However, with that amount of charge, the devices operate very well.  I may have one battery that is not charging fully but there is no way to tell. I would buy this product again. Perhaps your company could reach out and offer a solution to the 75% charging situation.\n",
      "Good so far Delivery was prompt and item as described\n",
      "Nice Not used long enough to complete all the ratings.One cell was a little high on voltage, Contacted Blackube.Blackube immediately sent four (!) more. Love the charger, the four leads for charging, The red indicator and the plugging straight into the cell.The company was just great in customer care. Highly recommend.\n",
      "good quality and performance so far wanted a powerful, rechargeable long lasting battery for security lights and other hi-use items and happy to have found Blackube product. I will test over time, then probably order more\n",
      "Nice As described, the!\n",
      "Perfect  product Exelent Product  I recevided in  perfect condition in Brazil\n",
      "Great battery This is one cool product.  Self charges with a USB port (no external charger required).  Reliable, good charge Li battery.\n",
      "It works Well i allowed it to charge over night. i put it in my camera and the battery life was 1/3. Not really pleased.\n",
      "Dud's! After four months these rechargeable batteries go flat within 24 hours! Thought I had bought a good product but I WAS FOOLED AGAIN!\n",
      "WOW! Repeat customer \"Powerful\" long lasting batteries..AA+ Thank you! I would have no hesitation whatsoever to recommend and highly!The power these 'AA' batteries hold is unmatched and can not be compared to any store bought AA Batteries.Not only are they [-much-stronger-] in charge, but fully long........... lasting... no joke. A Solid set of batteries here.Well done BlackCube, these are top of the line, solid, and quality made, my second purchase.\n",
      "Good performance except for capacity I purchased a set of 4 AA cells for use in wireless mics. Wanting to know how long a charge would last, I constructed a test fixture with a 15 ohm load (100 mA at 1.5 V). Although the specified capacity of these cells is 1,250 mAh, they only produced 657, 1,054, 1,100 and 1,112 mAh. These results are repeatable and sub-par. Might this be an indicator of other quality deficiencies? Other than capacity the cells performed well, maintaining a constant 1.5 V output until they drop abruptly to 0 V when depleted. This being the case, the device they power will not give a low battery warning - it will just stop working. These units incorporate a rechargeable lithium cell, recharging circuit and output voltage regulator within the profile of a AA package. The voltage regulator apparently cuts out if overloaded, preventing damage to the lithium cell. The series regulator inherently produces heat proportional to load current, explaining why some users reported heating. Unfortunately, maximum load current is not specified. I like the design because it provides the full 1.5 V required to operate my wireless mics and would probably give it 5 stars if they met their specified capacity.\n",
      "Long life for a good price. They seem to be holding their own in a Tascam DR-40 PCM recorder. I can even phantom power a condenser mic for a little while. I kinda wish they recharged via a normal battery charger, as opposed to the USB (one less part to wear out), but that’s personal preference and not enough to remove a star (unless they start giving me issues). All in all, a solid set of batteries\n",
      "Good batteries Prompt delivery. Good batteries. They charged with no problems. I am using them in a few remote controllers and in a couple of battery operated clocks. There have been no problems.\n",
      "So far so good!!! I used these batteries for my game cameras because regular alkaline batteries just would not last especially in the colder temps alkaline loose 50% of their capacity. These batteries have been in the cameras for three weeks now and are still showing 99% on the cameras charge meter reader. I will let you know a follow up as time goes on but the cameras that have regular batteries in them are down to 62% in the same time frame. I have four cameras. Two with regular batteries and two with these lithium rechargeables. So far I’m impressed. Expense was my only concern but I did the math and after the initial investment I will be saving hundreds over a years time of operating these cameras.\n",
      "Good way to replace AA alkaline Batteries I order this batteries, for my door lock, to replace the alkaline batteries that were dead in 3 to 4 days. This 1.5v Lithium batteries are working excellent. It hasn't show loss of energy, and the voltage stay the same at 1.5 Volts, after more than 200 operation of the door Lock.The package was delivered on time and the description was exactly what I got.\n",
      "100% Satisfaction guarantee UPDATE: I was contacted by seller and they refunded me, as they have a satisfaction guarantee policy. I appreciate it, thank you.I followed the instructions and charged the batteries for the time instructed and tried to test them on my flashlight. The flashlight started to strobe after 2-3 seconds on... I tried with the other 2 batteries and the same happened again. I tried to mix them up, still the same. I thought, maybe I didn't charge the enough. So I left them charging overnight. Next day I tried it again. Unfortunately it ended up with the same result, strobe light. I decided to put them in my glade air freshener. They lasted for 2 days in them(when regular batteries last almost 1 month)\n",
      "Back to the drawing board I am disappointed in these batteries, 6hrs hand scanner instead of 9hrs enloop rechargeable bat , 4hrs flashlight instead of 6hrs enloop , 8hrs GPS instead of 11hrs enloop bat  now worth it\n",
      "Lithium Ion Batteries The batteries do as they supposed to do, and are easy to recharge, although one of the batteries took a bit longer to recharge than the others. But all work well. The only reason for the 4 stars in that no battery is ever perfect. Saying that, I would still recommend them for purchasing!\n",
      "Good deal Security camera\n",
      "Great product First use is way beyond expectations. Items as ordered and only late because of weather delay. I’m planning on duplicating the order soon. Very satisfied!!\n",
      "Replaced lithium batteries in my “Blink” camera 👍 I bought these batteries to replace the lithium  battery in my “Blink” wireless security camera, I have it set on 15 second recording time and it lights up at night, I have a 10 year old son and this is the neighborhood house that all the kids come to play, I only mention this because it activates over 30 times a day, it’s been going strong for over a week now without changing them out. I’m impressed and they are very easily charged with included cable.  You have to give them an initial charge and when the red light goes off, you’re ready to roll.  So far so good, will update I’d things change, but for now, very happy!\n",
      "Not yet fully tested Work very well in a flashlight, but when used in a milk frother, the frother works very well for a five seconds or so then stutters - happens every time.  This could be an issue with the frother, but there is no stuttering when using AA alkaline batteries.\n",
      "Will save a lot of money They work great charge fast only issue is two of them don’t work for much would fully charge them and would die in the same day(used In a tv remote) if it wasn’t for that would give five stars\n",
      "Great product This batteries are excelent. 1.5v in a AA format. The best!\n",
      "Quick to Charge Simple to use, quick charge using Computer USB Port.\n",
      "5 stars These are EXCELLENT BATTERIES. And they hold a charge a very long time. They work great in my camera and video camera.\n",
      "Five Stars Works extremely well, charge on wireless cameras lasts about a week.\n",
      "Working fine After fully charging them, used them in my tooth brush, wireless keyboard and mouse. It’s been over a month know don’t see any problem so far.\n",
      "Safe efficient rechargeable They are safe, efficient, rechargeable\n",
      "Great step up for rechargable batteries They are very handy and the 4 in 1 cable is useful for just about every device as well.  Small red led on each batter indicates when fully charged.\n",
      "They work great and you only have to remember a cable. I thought they were pretty neat to have the cables plug directly into the batteries, no need to carry around a bulky proprietary charging box... just carry the included cable.  Super easy, very convenient.  They charge as described in around 2-2.5 hours (depending on the block you plug the cable into I suppose) and they last quite a bit of time.  I would buy these again for other home devices... thinking about getting another set for all my remotes (roku, and tv).\n",
      "My dead batteries work better than this. So, my techno thing is a battery eater, so I was looking for like a big pack of AAA batteries. Then I would not have to go buy more soon. I scrolled enough to see this, and I was all like this would be amazing. I will not have to go through a lot of batteries, I will not have to pay for a lot of batteries. I was syked.I finally got them in the mail, I immediately try them out, and they are not even charged, which I am okay with, just a bit disappointed. I plug them in, and then I waited for a quite a bit of time for the red light to turn blue. They turn blue, I put them in, It does not even work. I got more of jolt from a dead battery than this.\n",
      "Less contamination A very good product for our Business in Hospedaje Stefany in the Galápagos Islands\n",
      "Disappointed They dont hold charge on a head flashlight\n",
      "Recharge lights stopped working after 5 charges LIKE TO RECHARGE HOWEVER AFTER 5 charges the charge lights dont always work; I thought that they would have more charges. Good for the money though!\n",

      "Working well. Working well so far, I'll order the AA.\n",
      "charge quickly Haven't yet determined run time but no concerns, so far.  This is a very compact way to travel with batteries.\n",
      "Easy to recharge I love the fact that these are rechargeable with one plug. Expensive, but not compared to replacing batteries in remote control cars daily!\n",
      "These batteries charge up to 1.52 volts Normal rechargeable batteries charge up to 1.37 volts; these charge up to 1.52 volts\n",
      "Very Happy With These Batteries I use lithium batteries for all of my mobile products.  These particular batteries drive a pocket flashlight and an emergency weather related radio.  So far I have been completely satisfied.\n",
      "brilliant easy usb-recharchable batteries is a brilliant idea, and these work great\n",
      "Do not hold a charge! These do not hold a charge for nothing! To power a calculator (a calculator!), I need to charge them every week. Which means I get about 2-3 uses (total of about 15 minutes) out of the calculator before they die. Don't waste your money.\n",
      "7.2g great inside AAA adapter to lighten your mouse, save your wrist ;) 7.2g great inside AAA adapter to lighten your mouse (wrist efforts)Helpful customer service from HITRENDS/Christine(I reco you guys update/correct the weight of your battery for those of us shopping for lighter batteries.)I'll update my review if any issues.\n",
      "Bought these many times. wish I had bought them sooner These are one of my favorite things that I’ve bought recently. I wish they were around sooner. They combine the convenience of old-school batteries and the ease of USB charging. Very reliable. Futuristic item. Everyone I show them to loves them. Highly recommend.\n",
      "Trade off charge life for recharge ease The batteries do not last as long on a single charge as an alkaline, but they are VERY easily recharged.  Great for my wireless keyboard and mouse.\n",
      "works well I like that I don't have to think much about the rechargeable paradigm. Just use them and make sure nobody throws them out when they're drained!\n",
      "Bought four last year, just ordered four more These are great batteries. They don't last as long as Duracell, but I've been using one set of them for over a year and they still hold plenty of charge. Enough that I went and bought a second set. They get warm when you're constantly discharging them like most rechargeables, but not dangerously hot. I love that you just plug them into a micro USB charger. And I love that they come with a charger that accommodates all four.\n",
      "The future. These are my new normal. They take a short charge time. Last longer than standard batteries. They are charged by a usb micro. The top lights up red when charging and turns off when charged. Other than that they can be used for all AAA uses.\n",
      "Great when needed Grest value for what it is. Remotes will never stay drained or out of juice.\n",
      "Easy to Recharge Recharging time is quite rapid and easy to do.  Battery life is limited.\n",
      "Long lasting and durable. Great replacement for disposable batteries\n",
      "Wow...terrible Plugged in all 4 batteries to charge when they arrived.2 batteries charged no problem.1 battery LED was flickering and didn't fully charge after 2 hours.1 battery did not charge at all.\n",
      "Well Designed! The volts are spot on and recharges perfectly and has the recharging port! Color is nice a bright - no fear of loosing these. Very Satisfied!\n",
      "Finally long life rechargeable AAA These are great for the money.No more leaky AAA's and long lasting capacity.This pack also includes a short 4 battery USB to Micro USB charging cable.\n",
      "Not worth the $$ I spent $20 for rechargeable TV remote batteries!Extremely short run time in pocket flashlight originally purchased for. Doesn't hold charge in storage.\n",
      "Too quirky to be reliable I had a good experience with AA batteries rechargeable on USB so decided to try these AAA batteries.  They look well-made and recharge just fine using a USB port.  However, they were not dependable when used on two different devices.  When three of them were installed in a motion detecting night light, the light worked well initially but soon began to strobe or flicker even when no motion was detected.  This would quickly discharge the batteries, although they could then be recharged to a full charge as shown by a battery tester.  I recharged and tested all the batteries and found one that was defective.  I put three good batteries back in the nightlight but got the same strobe effect.  I recharged the batteries and put two of them in a small LED flashlight.  The flashlight worked well but then became noticeably warm.  The flashlight then popped and died.  I examined the flashlight but found no evidence of damage.  I put in two alkaline batteries and the flashlight worked well.  These AAA batteries are listed as working in a flashlight but there might be a quirk in the battery chip.  I have ordered a set of Eneloop AAA batteries, which have worked well for me in the past.\n",
      "Works Well! Fast delivery, work just as advertised.  Haven't had them long enough to gauge durability.  Like ability to recharge quickly.\n",
      "Economical for me Love anything that I solar charge!Granted upfront cost seems expensive but buying batteries for me for lcd lights small flashlights, speakers, portable fan,blood pressure machines and on & on, I live off grid and this has been an asset for me. I'm never without battery power...never.\n",
      "Works great They work great!\n",
      "Amazing so tired of replacing AAA no need for that now\n",
      "Rechargable Way lower capacity than normal AAA and needs charging all the time. Love the idea of it, I can't wait until they get it perfected.Using them for 6 months so far.\n",
      "AAA size doesnt hold charge as well as Lithium would be expected too. Use on a remote little weather station, don't last very long.  While $20 for a set of 4, poor performance pushes me back to alkaline.\n",
      "Great ! Are used it for my house phone.  So far so good.\n",
      "Great for Roku remote My roku remote was using the cheap free batteries I got when I bought something from the HF stores and basicAAA cells just did not last long. I got tired of changing batteries once a week. I wanted to try these lithium ionrechargeables.  What a big difference, the first set has lasted over a month of high use and are still going. You get four with a combine four charging cord. Charged two, about 2 hours and the red light went  off on the battery. Justplugged into my usb port on my computer. The other two are on standby in the plastic case provided. I am happy I got these.\n",
      "Far better than disposable AAA batteries. The charging cable is very convenient, the charging port is in a good spot, and recharged time is longer than I expected.\n",
      "Have To Charge A Lot The USB charging aspect is cool but the batteries don't last long after charging, hence why I mentioned have to charge a lot\n",
      "Don't buy this!! After 5 minutes the battery lost the power\n",
      "Works perfect I put them in a small flashlight and they work very well. I did notice that if I left the light on for about 10 minutes, the flashlight got quite warm. Not a problem.Thanks, love them, I'll buy more soon.\n",
      "These are great. These charge great over micro usb!\n",
      "Just what I ordered Worked perfectly and fit my needs exactly. Was doing a custom mouse modification (converting a wired mouse to wireless) and needed a rechargeable battery that would allow me to recharge the mouse by connecting a usb cable to it. Worked like a charm, and couldn't be happier with my purchase.\n",
      "Wil NOT charge in headhones that are plugged in! Will NOT work in headphones that are plugged in to a wall outlet!\n",
      "Ok Ok\n",
      "Quality Good product\n",
      "Works great Easy to use\n",
      "The latest and greatest rechargable battery Charging cable is a cool addition\n",
      "Nice alternative to ordinary batteries. Instructions are in Chinese. Everybody can read Chinese, right?Just plug in and they light up red. That doesn't mean stop. it means the charging is starting. Who woulda thunk it?Anyway, the little buggers are going to be used in my remotes.  I'll change my rating if they don't do a good job.That's my review and I'm sticking to it.  (unless of course, these little Chinese guys bail out on me)Have a super day!\n",
      "Time saver These are so convenient and easy to charge the multi charger makes it a breeze to do multiple batteries at the same time, which save space on charging. I wish they would do this on other sizes too.\n",
      "GOOD BUY ALL WORKED HAVE AAA AND D.  DO NOT BUY THE TWHARF BRAND, 1/2 DO NOT WORK  AS WITH ANY TYPE LI-ION DO NOT USE IN A LIGHT IF THE BATTERY IS NEXT TO LED THAT PUTS OFF HEAT OR HAS A HIGH AMP DRAW.\n",
      "Perfect product I never bought another batteries again, this one’s doing all\n",
      "Don't hold a charge I've only had these for a couple of months, but they can't hold a charge anymore. The instructions said that these should last about 3 years, but I don't think that's the case for mine. Considering how many other rechargeable battery options Amazon offers, I wouldn't buy these.\n",
      "Good batteries I bought these to use in my wireless mouse. I use my mouse all day, everyday and go through a lot of batteries.\n",
      "Description matches product. Good quality product\n",
      "Easy charge I bought these for my pen lights I use at work, they charge well and seem to last as long as store bought batteries, I was alittle skeptical at first because of the size and I've never seen AAA batteries with a USB charger like these, but I like them, would buy again if I need more, thank you\n",
      "Ok buy, but ! I put these batteries in a wireless mouse I barely use for work and the charge is always done by time I get to use it. Lucky for me it came with 4 so I can swap them out.. I wish it held a longer change seeing that I barely use the items i bought this for.\n",
      "Good item Works with all producta\n",
      "These do not hold a charge very long at all. These do not hold a charge very long at all. I recycled them.\n",
      "DANGEROUS -- DO NOT BUY DANGEROUS -- DO NOT BUYThese do not charge on a normal 1.5 volt charger; at least, they are simply not recognized by a Maha quick/soft charger.These will charge on a lithium-capable intelligent charger.  On a Nitecore branded smart charger the appear to charge in the 4 +/- volt range.  However, they do not hold a charge worth bothering with.  They are quickly drained in any application I've tried -- electric toothbrush, electric ear trimmer, flashlight -- never lasting more than about 5 minutes of run time.These appear to charge on a micro-usb charger; however, BEWARE!The first battery I put on a micro-usb charged from dead flat for a couple hours.  When I checked it the LED was still solid red, indicating it was charging; however, the battery was extremely hot and after taking it off and letting it cool down I noticed the battery had swollen and was deformed along one side.  Note this deformation in the uploaded picture.The second battery I tried charging with micro-usb (not having learned my lesson apparently) was also from dead flat.  After less than 10 minutes the battery began to SMOKE!  Smoke poured out the micro-usb port until I was able to disconnect it, burning myself in the process.THIS PRODUCT IS DANGEROUS!  I post this as public service message.  Seller and manufacturer -- do not bother contacting me, I will not take this review down as this product presents a danger to the public.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS PRODUCT, AND DISCONTINUING USE IF YOU ALREADY OWN.\n",
      "Heavy Duty At last I have 1.5v batteries that retain their charge the whole cycle time !!  My wireless headset audio is louder and sound no longer Flickers.  This was a trial buy of new Technology and I am Very pleased.  I will now slowly replace all my NiMH rechargeable batteries with these Li-Ion.\n",
      "Great batteries I love having rechargeable batteries.  I'm using them for some instant on closet lights and under the counter in the kitchen.  I do have to recharge them every two weeks which I think is excessive.  However, they're fast and easy to recharge.\n",
      "No electric outlet needed in emergency I'm switching all my AA and AAA batteries to ones that recharge with USB. If the SHTF and I don't have power, I can still use any solar charger and use anything I have.\n",

      "Great Great\n",
      "Extreme Short life I put three fully charged Sorbo AAA batteries into a head lamp to work in the evenings. They died in under 30 minutes. Recharged and again less than 30 minutes. Alkaline batteries last 3 to 4 evenings at about 2 hours each night. Definitely not worth the money.\n",
      "Wonderful batteries These batteries are great\n",

      "Easy to recharge and easy to use. I would recommend these, very handy to have around the house.\n",

      "Not even a week in my mouse. They need to last longer than that!  I returned them and bought a set of Blackube's -- which lasted longer but had their own issues.  I've got \"Amazon's Choice\" in lithium AA's and they've been lonngggg lasting and problem free.  Perhaps the AAA format is just too small for the current state of electronics...\n",

      "The batteries should be tested for voltage before installing in electronics. I purchased this product and the original order showed that it was ready to ship and stayed that way until it showed lost after 10 days.  I went through the process to get a refund and ended up having to chat with an Amazon customer rep that issued a refund.  I reordered and received the next order in the promised time. I am writing this review for the AAA set of batteries.  I ordered 4 because that's how many i needed.  When I installed them in my device it would not power on.  My next step was to charge them.  So I got out my volt meter to be on the safe side to check voltage to see why they needed charging.  I tested the voltage and 3 of the 4 tested at just over 1.5 volts.  The problem was the 4th battery that tested at just over 4 volts.  The batteries didn't need charging at all.  I have 1 battery that was not quality checked before it left the factory and was dangerously over voltage for an AAA battery.  The batteries charge well so far.  Because of the lack of in house quality control, I can not give this product more than 3 stars.  I will update this review once I have contacted the seller and try to resolve the 4th battery.  I also purchased at the same time the AA batteries and will test and review them soon.Update:  I have changed the rating from 3 to 4 stars.  I am in the process of monitoring these batteries.  In my original review, one of the 4 batteries was over voltage.  I charged it one cycle, retested it fresh off the charge and it was still over voltage at 4.03 volts.  I decided to let it rest for 2 hours to stabilize after charging and retested it.  To my amazement, it tested 1.533 volts.  I installed it with the other 3 in my appliance and it worked fine.  I will continue to monitor these regularly to insure that they remain in specs.  I am testing the idea that in some instances, the internal circuit that monitors and charges needs a cooling down period to switch from 3.7 lithium volts before it bucks down to 1.5 volts.  I will update with my results after a few days have passed.\n",
      "Doesn't seem to last any longer than my NiMH batteries Pro:  Works in certain situations where other rechargeable batteries don't.Con:  Batteries show that they are fully charged until they suddenly die.  Cost a lot more than other rechargeables.They were worth it for me, because there are some things that I have, where NiCAD and NiMH batteries don't seem to work and I needed regular alkaline batteries that wear down rather quickly.\n",
      "The battery last for long time 2.5 hours to fully charge. Great battery.\n",

I just replace the batteries with two fresh ones, recharge the other pair, and I am good to go.  Good price, good product, I would recommend these. USB charger is a great thing.

      "1.5 volt rechargeable AAA I rate these with five stars because they are a super nifty upgrade to most devices that require 1.5, 3.0, or 4.5 volts in 1, 2, or 3 series boxes.  Ni-Cad 1.2 volt cells have been disappointing me for years now and it is worth five stars to finally have a rechargeable 1.5 volt cell with depth. The only downside is that my old TV Listener wireless headphones don't like them. In this antique application they cause an unacceptable amount of RF interference. I only just got them so time will tell as to durability. They seem sturdy and well built. They charged right up (Not Pre-Charged. I don't care.).\n",
      "Voltage stays relatively constant Unlike alkaline batteries, these keep a relatively constant voltage throughout it discharge cycle.  This makes these batteries very worthwhile...\n",
      "Great batteries. Save money and stop throwing away old batteries I love these batteries and purchased them because I already have the AA version and love them. Battery life is good. Charge time is good. The charging cord allows you to charge all 4 at the same time. My significant other loves to use battery lit decorations when we have company (like twinkle lights in a vase) and she went through so many batteries before I got these. They also hold a charge well when in storage. I don't think I will be using them in my tv remote because a normal battery already lasts forever but recharge-ables are a must for any heavy use items!\n",

      "excellent product for a narrow set of applications Bought these for my boss who loves to visit inhospitable places across the planet and hates to bring a charger. These batteries do everything themselves - you plug them into a USB outlet and they refill inside of some 90 minutes. One outlet will charge all four of them and they neatly indicate that they are still charging with a fierce red light and will then go dark once full.You have to charge them via the USB - the LiPo charger will not understand how to charge them and perhaps even damage them. They charge quite linearly. You can do half full in some 40 minutes.The energy content is not great and the seller also makes no such claims. They hold .4Ah over 1..5V, some 2100 joules.They do self-discharge rather swiftly, so the \"pre-charged\" claim will be 80% untrue by the time you get them.They are hence best suitable for heavy use on the go or for constant use. Don't use them to save battery cost on your Bose headset unless you use it all the time.The light indicator is really neat. It's so bright you can operate the batteries in complete darkness, outdoors or aboard a plane. They have good low tolerances and are all quite equal in charge time and capacity. And the fact that they can be fed via an ordinary micro-USB cable is a great feature.\n",

For travels, no times for new battery, more use for kid toys, and backup for battery for important equipments. For example, TV remote controller as often use, no money from no times in travels, and saving money for other things. No favors to have five stars, these batteries are indeed a good favors for any purposes,ideas and reasons to buy, use and needs at all times.

These batteries fit and work perfectly in devices needing AAA batteries. They only need a standard micro-USB cable to charge. A cable that can charge 4 batteries at once was included. Charging time is fairly short, seems to be less than 2 hours.Cons: A trade-off for the built in charging port on the battery is that there is less room in the battery case for actual Li polymer so they do not have a lot of capacity. In my experience they only last about 20-25% as long as an alkaline battery would last in the same application.Verdict: For my situation and uses they are fine and I am glad I bought them. If you have electronic devices that require lots of power they may not have a long enough use time to satisfy you.\n",
      "Oh Wow! These are so amazing. Easy to use. True Lithium Ion power. Holds constant charge until completely drained. There is no drain or slowing down. Will definitely repurchase.\n",
      "Not really lithium! I don't think these batterys are really lithium batteries. Received mine and no where does it say lithium. Not on the box or the batterys?\n",
      "Easy to charge from laptop Like that LEDs are red during charge and off when charged. Nice to recharge from laptop while on the road.\n",
      "These things don't last Received these as a gift and was excited about the concept. Used them is a small pen-style flashlight for about 30 seconds per day and they last about 10 days. Expected much more.\n",
      "I wouldn't..... Neat concept, and love lithium ion batteries, but these don't last long at all\n",
      "No charging port! No charging port. No way to charge them!\n",
      "Convenient and fast Likes: Love convenience. Just plug them into usb charger for an hour.Dislikes: Charge only lasts a few hours when using in headphones.\n",
      "These  socalled rechargable batteruiiiiiiiies cannot br charged These batteries CANNOT be charged in AAA battery charger. Just JUNK!!!\n",
      "Don't hold a charge for long Batteries only last for 2hrs max in led head lamp, regular batteries last for at least 40hrs.\n",
      "Convenient batteries Unsure how many hours I get out of each battery when I use in noise canceling BOSE headphones,  but they are convenient and they charge fine,  so I am happy with my purchase.\n",
      "Worth the investment The batteries are still new but they hold the charge, operate the device and definitely last longer than standard rechargeable batteries. For my purposes they are well worth the money.\n",
      "terrible battery life after full charge I have used these twice in a headlamp.  throwaway lithium batteries last 12 hours.  In two usages of these I have the following:Use 1:  fully charged battery lasted one hour before the lamp went completely dark.Use 2:  fully charged battery lasted 1/2 hour before the lamp went completely dark.Good thing it happened when I did not absolutely need the light.  These batteries cannot be counted on.  Worst $20 I have ever spent.\n",
      "LOVE BATTERIES LIKE THESE HAVE OTHER BATTERIES LIKE THESE AND THEY TOO ARE EZ TO CHARGE AND WORK WELL.THESE REALLY ARE A COMPLETE PACKAGE, AT A GREAT PRICE..  SO FAR SO GOOD AFTER A FEW USES IN A NEW HEAD LAMP I GOT AT THE SAME TIME.  THE INDICATOR LIGHT ON THE BATTERIES IS SUPER COOL WHEN CHARGING.  BUYING MORE. PLUS THE USB CORD THAT DOES ALL 4 OF MY DOUBLE A's AT THE SAME TIME.  SIMPLY GENIUS.\n",
      "It does not last long when powering insect repellent I returned these batteries after using them for a few days.  I bought these batteries to power battery operated insect repellent. However, the insect repellent only worked for few hours when powered by these batteries. Have to stop in the middle of yard work to change batteries. Very inconvenient. The same insect repellent worked for few days when powered by conventional Duracell or Energizer batteries. I like the fact that these batteries are USB rechargeable (no need for extra charger). However, they have to last. I don't expect them to last as long as conventional alkaline batteries. But, I did not expect them to have such short battery life.\n",
      "Best and safest rechargeable battery you can buy. I use this product all the time. I use them in my Bose headphones I bought on amazon. They last the same amount of time as any other rechargeable battery. I like how I can change them with a usb cable. They also never get nearly as hot as the energizers I used to use.\n",
      "NOT WHAT THEY ADVERTISE - AT ALL ! I needed some HIGH voltage batteries, and these were described as 1600.  I was FURIOUS when the package arrived - it was not four batteries with a 1600 charge each - it was four batteries with a SUBSTANDARD charge of 400 each!  and 4 x 400 equals 1600 - for the entire group !  It was like ordering an 8 ounce filet mignon and being served two Quarter Pounder hamburgers.  What a rip-off !\n",
      "Keeps 1.5 volts Just got them the other week and used them for a week. So far I like them . Probably buy some AA ones next. Wish they had more mah as they don’t last long as nimh batteries with high mah. But they keep the 1.5 volts and don’t really drop in voltage.\n",
      "Saved me many times. I am guilty of not shutting off my wireless mouse.  These have saved me many times.  I put 2 in the mouse and plug the other 2 in to charge.  When I kill 2 of them, I just swap them out.  No down time.\n",
      "Decent set of batteries I bought these because recently I bought a streamlight stylus the aaa version and I wanted to be able to have batteries that were in better condition than what I had lying around so these were the first things I decided to try and boy do these deliver. I have had my light on for roughly 4 hours and it stayed running I can't complain seems to be of good quality.\n",
      "Re-Chargeable Battery Seller delivered promptly. Only issue is that they don't hold charge for long time if used often.\n",
      "Worth the cost Great product fast shipping seem to have long life use them in my August door lock pin pad which had been going through Duracell batteries every few days been over two weeks and still haven’t had to recharge these batteries..\n",
      "Is this really a lithium battery? Nowhere on the battery or on the box did i find the word \"lithium\" or \"li\" as presented on their ad here. I still have to see how it works.\n",
      "Thank Perfect I loved\n",
      "Used as table decor for a birthday luncheon. It was the perfect addition to my table decor, soft light being perfect without being too harsh as the white lite was.  I can't speak to the battery life, or the durability (thought they are delicate) as I just recently purchased them and used them only once.  As for ease of use, very easy.\n",
      "Very good product Use it for a cellphone\n",
      "Storage capacity way too low This battery has a capacity of 400 milliAmp hours.  A typical AAA alkaline battery has capacity 800 to 1200 mAh, double to triple.  I use these in an LED head lamp to work outside at night, and the lights go dim after 20 to 25 minutes, meaning these batteries need to be recharged.  This is very disappointing for such expensive batteries.  If someone made AAA lithium rechargeable batteries that had 1600 to 2400 milliAmp hour capacity, then that would be a product worth looking at.  These 400 mAh batteries don't cut it for running a head lamp.\n",
      "BATTERIES ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY  TO USE THESE BATTERIES TO DATE. GLAD TO HAVE THEM WHEN I WILL NEED THEM.\n",
      "Initial charge was quick...now I am waiting for battery performance Batteries charged up and installed in my devices. I will give a rating for battery life and durability once I see how they perform.\n",
      "Die quickly My Amazon Firestick remote dies every 6 weeks with regular batteries, so I bought these. Now it dies weekly, but at least these batteries can be reused. I’m not sure how long they will keep a week-long charge, but will update.\n",
      "Works Great I used these batteries in a head light to examine structural steel. It works very well for the short time I have used it. They last for the entire shift and keep the light very bright.\n",
      "Nice Nice\n",
      "great product. great battery, longer life, can charge in my 4 battery charger. great price.\n",
      "Had high hopes for this product (lithium aaa battery) I bought this set of batteries hoping that it replaces the traditional alkaline ones.  I’ve had it for several months now and have been quite disappointed.  I tried using it in a range of products from computer mice/keyboards to flashlights to trinkets that barely draws any power.  They all lasted no more than a couple of days.  If your life depends on it, steer clear from this product.  If you don’t mind the frequent charging, give it a shot.Pros:Lithium (meter reads 1.42v when fully charged)Convenient- Standard micro usb chargingMfg supplies a 4 prong microusb dongle for chargingLess chance of leakage (unlike alkalines)ConsPoor battery life (max 2 days)\n",
      "good value. Never be without a battery for headphones Compact and is easily recharged.\n",
      "Stopped charging These stopped charging after two months. I've only used them once. I tried several different chargers that I know work, so I know it's the batteries. Unacceptable.\n",
      "ok The batteries do not hold a long charge.\n",
      "It worked and I like it used USB. It worked and I like it used USB.\n",
      "Pretty good I have a 4-1 sensor for my home automation. I was using the Panasonic Eneloops but they would get very low within a couple of weeks. I got tired of changing out the batteries. So I tried these batteries. My app showed the batteries at 100% for the longest time, like a month. I didn't think that was correct so i charged them without measuring the voltage. Same thing a month later so decided to measure the voltage. To my amaze, the voltage was still a little over 1.5v. Better than the Energizer Bunny, lol. I'm pretty happy with these batteries.\n",
      "High quality battery Happy with this purchase\n",
      "Perfect kit.  Comes with everything you need. They comes with the splitting charging usd cables and plastic case.  Ready for travel use.This is now part of my indoor cellphone photography lighting mini kit.\n",
      "Overall good. Batteries were good but two of the four usb cables were not working. Company needs better quality control.\n",
      "Only last two weeks per charge Bad batteries. Do not buy these.I use this on a wireless keyboard and a TV remote. I only use the keyboard to login to my HTPC and use the TV remote to turn on the TV. So, these devices do not get use that much. But these batteries are drained after just a couple of weeks of use.\n",
      "AAA rechargeable batteries Quick delivery...batteries work well.\n",
      "Low capacity Running a quick test of 3 AAA cells in my LED flashlight, they died after 25 minutes on high. They were quite warm. The stated capacity is 400mAh but I didn't try to measure it. Embossed on the side of the flashlight it indicated that it could run at full brightness for 4 hours with unstated AAAs. Quick web search shows 1000 mAh at 10 mA discharge. Since I didn't measure the discharge rate when in my flashlight the comparison is not very valid. Nonetheless, giving up room in the battery for the USB micro and related charging circuitry, it isn't surprising that the performance is so low.\n",
      "Beware - they drain quickly I used these in a small flashlight.  I got about 15 mins of usage out of the flashlight before they died - and it was not constant either - just turning the flashlight on and off over a period of 15 mins and them poof - dead.  And these were not cheap!  Too expensive for such terrible performance.\n",
      "Great product great customer service. The batteries are a great convenient design and the included cable to charge all 4 at once is a great inclusion. Their capacity is not as high as non-rechareable but are great for things like flashlights or game controllers.They also come with a nice little storage box which is great for keeping a handful charged to quickly swap out. Charging only took maximum of 2 hours. They do not come charged. Due to their cost vs non-rechargeable and their lower charge density it looks like recharging about 16 times would equal the cost of a 32 pack at costco. But also consider the amount of waste from throwing batteries out. Rated for 1000 cycles means they should pay for themselves many times over.I purchased 3 packs and only 1 battery was bad out of a total of 12.HITRENDS had excellent customer service and gave a partial refund which I thought was better than dealing dealing with shipping a whole pack back when 3 worked perfectly fine.\n",
      "LONG LASTING Just what I needed to protect sensitive equipment from leaking battery damage.  Being rechargeable without need for a separate charger is a definite PLUS.\n",
      "Excellent choice. Excellent choice. I will be ordering more\n",
      "Rechargeale is nice without a special recharger Delivery was on time. Charging no problems. It appears it has solve a mouse problems as the voltage drops with use. After being off the voltage appears to recover for a while. With the lithum you have 1.5 V until discharged. Rechargeale is nice without a special recharger. Durability is yet to be determined.\n",
      "Great batteries, so far even better than I expected them AAA\n",
      "Great batteries Batteries work great. Prompt delivery.\n",
      "Don’t waist your money Does not hold a charge\n",
      "Doesn't charge properly. Chargedoesntlastlong I was so disappointed when I finally got this in. The cable it brings didn't charge the batteries properly. One of them only charged when I removed it off the provided cable and put it on a separate micro USB cable. And even then it took about 6hrs for it to charge. And the charge didn't last at all.  Would not buy more from this company\n",
      "Rechargeable Recommend everyone to buy this stuff!Rechargeable battery is good for environment.Also easy to use and has a great price :)\n",
      "Excellent Rechargeable Batteries! Easy to use - plug a micro usb cable into them and they charge right back up! No more late night drives to the store for batteries. Must have for TV remotes!\n",
      "nice stuff very ez to use，and looks very good\n",
      "Just what I needed. They're your basic batteries and do exactly what I needed them to do. If they turn out to have a short battery life, I will update this review.\n",
      "It's very durable I use it on my SPA machine. This machine is very power-hungry. I used to buy a battery in 3 days, which is a waste of money and time, and it is not environmentally friendly.  An ordinary mobile phone plug can be recharged, and it can be used for a long time. I will never throw away waste batteries and make the bathroom sink rusty and mottled!  I am very happy to share my experience with you ，It's really practical and convenient!\n",
      "Rechargeable First time i tried rechargeable regular  batteries and find them working very good like the idea they are working same like other batteries.\n",
      "Mostly good batteries The two batteries I’m using right now are working well. There were only a few minor things wrong. The batteries were supposed to be already charged it said on the box, but they were all dead when I got them. In addition, the batteries are supposed to take 6 hours to change, and three of them did, but one of the batteries would not fully charge even after 24 hours.\n",
      "usb rechargeable battery The micro-USB cable is more suitable for out-of-town charging than other rechargeable batteries. Using this cable to charge multiple devices at the same time can be recycled. It is still the focus of my attention. So far, they are running well and working hours are new.  The non-rechargeable battery is almost the same and can be fully charged in a few hours. The rechargeable battery greatly extends the life of the battery. Most of my batteries can be recharged now, which can reduce costs and reduce pollution. It is strongly recommended to use rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "Love rechargeable batteries! These batteries’ quality is super good. They last a long time and they are rechargeable! I suggest everybody to start using rechargeable batteries. They are more environmentally sustainable! The price is great! And I can’t be happier about these batteries!\n",
      "It works Anything AAA batteries are used for.\n",
      "Best value Great product!\n",
      "AAA Rechargeable Battery easy to recharge,last much longer than nicad\n",
      "Good Product Works exactly as advertised... comes with a charging cable that allows you to charge all four batteries at once from one usb output. Very convenient. Outputs a full 1.5 volts which was the reason I chose these over NiMH batteries despite a much lower capacity... that was the only drawback but they are also much lighter weight and the charging mechanism takes up a lot of space due to the size of the connector so that's the trade off you make.\n",
      "Great voltage under load and works great If you compare these to other lithium they work really well I had problems with voltage sag on other rechargeable and these are working great.\n",
      "Good bang for the buck. So far so good.\n",
      "Works as Promised Batteries have lasted as promised, easy and intuitive to use, and I love not having to throw away old batteries and just charging overnight, and presto, I am good to go for another few weeks with my mouse and keyboard. Love the Bump!\n",
      "each 4 pack has 1 dead battery Con: each 4 pack has 1 dead batteryPro: other 3 work perfect.\n",
      "Great batteries but doesn't work with magnavox universal controller These batteries have already paid for themselves but they don't work with one of my magnavox universal controller otherwise I would give it 5 stars.\n",
      "Excellent for low power use items As with many rechargeable batteries the 800 mWh is important here, a typical AA stores 2200 mWh so the batteries are not going to last long in things like a flashlight but they are great for remote controls or other low power use devices.The reason to get these is that you don't need a special charger for them. Pop the cap and plug the battery into a USB port and let it charge. No muss no fuss.\n",
      "They work, but with too many compromises to recommend. Problem #1: The USB port at the top is shorter than standard length (see picture) so they don't work in some devices, including my computer. They won't go into any port where the plastic/covering is too thick.Problem #2: These things seem to have terrible standby life. Not sure if it's just my mouse, but whenever I leave these things uncharged for more than a day or two, they seem to go dead (or at least not have enough charge to make my mouse work) meaning I've resorted to leaving one plugged in at all times and swapping.The overall battery life is ok, I get a few weeks on a charge in my G602 mouse. I'd recommend getting a USB dock (as pictured) to charge these things, as that works perfectly, and one with a switch will let you turn the charging current on and off. The included LEDs light up when charging, and the battery caps have magnets, so they're pretty easy to attach to the USB port on top. Overall, if they fit in your USB charger, they're very convenient, but I'm not sure I'd recommend them over some ordinary rechargeables (or just ol' reliable AA's).\n",
      "Long lasting with my professional photography equipment, primarily flash! I think it should be sold with a hub.\n",
      "handy batteries They hold a charge well and easily recharge on my laptop\n",
      "GOOD TO HAVE FOR EMERGENCY BACKUP--MINI-USB CHARGER INCLUDED So far, I have only charged the little batteries to be ready when I need them and not had a chance to try them out. I had no problem charging them, since they came with a 4-corded cable that plugs into a single USB outlet. I think they will be good for emergency use.\n",
      "Short USB plug makes charging a challenge The USB plug on the batteries, used for charging, are shorter than most standard plugs.  I found that they work in some chargers, but not others, or sometimes they just barely work if you wiggle them just right.  However, I would be very concerned about charging them in a charger where they just barely make connection, because if the contact area is very small, it could overheat due to the amount of current passing through it.  For that reason, I'd caution against charging them in a laptop (wall chargers are much cheaper to replace), and try to find a charger that seems to provide a good, solid connection.\n",
      "Curious side effect in my mouse I put 2 of these in my IMAC's mouse & it seems to make it act up from time to time! It's weird! The two in the keyboard are fine!\n",
      "NOT Li-ion! Nickel is NOT Lithium! This is a Ni-MH rechargeable battery NOT a Li-ion battery. Not recommended for applications requiring Li-ion or alkaline performance. Intended use in home thermostat FAILED due to the poor performance of this product presented with misleading information and erroneous specification claims.\n",
      "New idea I like the idea of combining the batteries and USB it makes sense.\n",
      "useless I tried these in my work flashlight and was throughly disappointed. They lasted on 30 minutes as  to 2 hours. They immediately turned off with no warning and were absolutely useless. I'm looking to return them right now.\n",
      "False advertising. Charging indicator light doesn't work on any of the batteries on one of my genuine samsung chargers that came with an older phone, but it works with another samsung charger that came with another phone. Each battery is labeled lithium ion but the package they come in is labeled as ni-mh which is a completely different type of battery. Pretty sure I've been swindled by made in China again, but the battery technically works, I've got it in a wireless mouse and we'll see how long it lasts.\n",
      "So far, so good They charge up quickly and seem to hold charge as long as standard batteries. Haven't have them long enough to determine durability.\n",
      "Don’t plug these into anything important! As you can see in the photo, these are not standard length USB connections, so they won’t work in many ports. I was able to get it to start charging in the USB port of my Netgear router, then it burned up my router! My router was completely fine, and now it’s a complete junk. As a former network administrator, I’ve checked and tried everything with the router.\n",
      "Mal producto, no lo compren. Compré dos juegos de 4 baterías 🔋, en total 8 pero solo funcionaron 5, Es molesto el tener que hacer el cambio del producto. Al conectarlo a cargar no funcionaron\n",
      "Battery life very  short Battery life is very short on my remote control last only  40 minutes no happy at all\n",
      "Charges in less than 1 hour and without heating up The batteries work as advertised, they charge super fast (about 30min using USB 2.0 from a laptop) and do not heat up which could turn out to be a beneficial factor that increases the longevity.A red light flashes while charging and it stays red after full charge (this confused me the first time since I was expecting it to change to a green light instead).\n",
      "Bad product Doesn't charge well. gets to hot when charging\n",
      "Very clever I think this is very clever. You can literally recharge this anywhere. I think I'm going to buy some AAA as well. Will save money in the long run.\n",
      "These batteries are the future! These batteries couldn't be easier to use. Pop the cap off and plug them into a usb slot for 20 minutes and you have a brand new fully charged battery. Yes they are way more expensive than standard batteries but when you think about how many batteries you use around the house and are always replacing then this makes sense. They go really well with a 20 slot usb lightning charger.\n",
      "I was shorted a battery  I got 3 not 4 It would of been nice if I would of got all 8 batteries I ordered instead of 7  not to happy right now\n",
      "Very novel idea - I love it Love these rechargeable batteries. The best part is you don't need to bring a special charger. These batteries have a USB connector to charge. They can be charged through any USB port. This is extremely convenient. Great for electronic devices like wireless mice, game controllers and remote controls. Charging is relatively fast -- fully charged in a couple of hours. One draw back is that it does require a USB port which means for most wall plug USB ports, you can charge either one or two batteries at the same time. Recommended.\n",
      "long lasting Product used for  remote control for gaming.Perfect!\n",
      "Nice design for a built in USB charging Option Didn’t know this design was possible. So many USB ports available on TVs etc to charge in a pinch while traveling.\n",
      "The new face of rechargeable batteries. To date since placing & receiving my order I've saved, rough estimate, about $60-$80 minimum with these batteries. I'ma straight Vidjit (Vidjagame Idiot) & I play ALOT of C.O.D. whether it's Zombies or Multiplayer... I play ALOT.  So the savings after just one month has paid for the batteries AND THEN I made $60 more or less. Without a doubt will be ordering more, when I need new ones, just to have another set of 4 simply to keep on hand & as gifts. EvERboDY I've shown then to, I lead with 'the face of the modern rechargeable battery' gets a kick outta that immediately followed with taking note if their very very practical nature. Only thing I will say is if the top were attached to the body of the battery in some way that would make them even more convenient than they already are. Otherwise the bestest thing since sliced bread.\n",
      "Works for video game controllers or remotes fairly well I have a couple video game setups in my house and love to play when I get a chance. Something that I have gotten a bit more cognizant of, as I age, is the environment and also my budget. I seriously love when I can help the environment a bit while also saving myself from having to dish out any money and these two batteries have helped quite a bit. I have used these in my Xbox One controller and they work very well. The only pain is if you have only one set, you have to wait for them to recharge but they do so fairly quickly. They are solid to use in a pinch for a gaming controller (better if you have 2 sets so you can always have one charged/topped off) but they are especially good in remote controls for the TV or whatever requires AA batteries. I think that these have found their \"forever home\" in a Sharp TV remote as I hopefully shouldn't have to purchase another set for that again. The battery life was fairly good for my Xbox controller but it has proven great for lower drain devices (E.g. Remotes). I would highly recommend getting these for lower battery drain scenarios instead and only using with controllers in a pinch.Pros:Works well with remotesHelps the environmentSaves money on buying non-rechargeable batteriesSimple/easy to chargeNeutral:Works solid in Xbox controller but takes a while to charge (so get another set if you plan on this being the main use for these)Cons:These last a long time in remotes and low drain devices but don't last as long as the really good non-rechargeables in higher drain devices (controllers, cameras)Overall, these are a solid value and I would recommend checking them out if you are in the market.\n",
      "Take a Long time to recharge and Drain Fast These AA batteries rechargeable batteries arrived in a perfect condition, and very well packed.They do have a good build quality and I like the concept of recharging them, it's very good on paper but in real life, they do take a very long time to recharge, i left them over night and the light indicator didn't show fully charged yet, so i used them in my son's remote controlled robot they stayed for like 25-30 min before dying, the regular energizer batteries stayed for 4 hours..Overall, if you're planning to use these with power hungry electronic, then stay away, but for remote or clocks and stuff like that, then i highly recommend them\n",
      "Nifty This is a set of 4 rechargeable batteries that can be recharged by USB. The batteries are the standard size and shape of AA batteries. But on their ends, they have USB micro ports. To charge them, just us a USB A to USB micro charging cable to plug the batteries into a USB charging source (transformer not included). You can also charge the batteries in a standard AA battery charger, which can be handy for charging more than one at a time.I find these batteries work just as well as my other rechargeable batteries, and they are comparable in performance to regular non-rechargeable AA batteries. The USB charging feature is really slick, since you can recharge these batteries anywhere you go so long as you have a standard phone charge with a micro USB cable. Overall, these batteries are innovative and work well.\n",
      "Lacking Nice Idea, just a bad application of it.  When at full charge these are not the same as a regular battery and will not even work in several things we have tried.  They only work with low draw items... like a wall clock.  Which, is pretty pointless; you want rechargeable batteries for items that burn through batteries quickly; and, so far, I have found that these do not work with any of them.  Then, when you do use it on a low draw item and need to charge it again, it takes over a day to get a full charge back!  And, lastly, if you used all four in one item, you only have 1 charger which is not going to cut it.\n",
      "Interesting These batteries are odd, but they work as they are supposed to and it's nice to not need a special contraption to charge them in.  Connect them to a standard USB charger and they charge right up.  They have an indicator to tell you when they are charged.  Charging multiple at once can be an issue, though.\n",
      "These ANVOW AA USB rechargeable batteries really are 1.5 volts, unlike a lot of others These AA batteries have their own USB port on the top of battery so it eliminates the use of a cable to charge them, so you can just plug them into the side of your laptop/desktop or into anything that has a USB port (I used my Phones wall plug in). Which makes the need for a separate battery Charger unnecessary.The other thing I like about these ANVOW AA Batteries is that they really are 1.5 Volts (see pic on tester) unlike most of the Rechargeable batteries as most are only 1.2 volts...(see pic of Duracell AA Rechargeable battery on my tester).  This is a REALLY BIG DEAL for me since my Digital camera will not operate on 2.4 Volts (two 1.2 V AA's) and buying throw away batteries are expensive...but it powers right up and last for ever literally with these ANVOW AA's in it.  I also noted that they make my Mini Flashlight a lot brighter than the 1.2 V rechargeable ones do.Convenience, More Power, Fast Charging and at a really good price...whats not to Love.......gets some, you'll be glad you did.\n",
      "Convenient, but they won't replace disposables These batteries take about 1.5 hours to fully charge at 5V (the red light goes from flashing to steady), and last almost exactly 3 hours in my little one-cell LED flashlight.Given the short charge life, these obviously won't replace disposable \"real\" batteries, or even the rechargables that need a charger.  But they're convenient to have around.Note that when the charge runs out the flashlight goes off suddenly, it doesn't gradually dim down.  So these batteries are not for safety-critical applications.\n",
      "Works as intended Seems like a good product. Works as intended. The charging speed is good. Red light flashes while charging and it stays red after full charge. The cap holds on to the battery while charging with a magnet. That’s a nice touch.\n",
      "Very convenient, but unreliable Already, in only a few days of use, one of them shows fully charged on the USB (sustained red light), but shows only .5V (point five) volts on the voltmeter.  Another one will not light up on the USB at all; apparently it is shorted and shows near-zero volts and will not take a charge.  Unreliable.While the design idea is brilliant -- to be able to pull off the top plastic cap and stick them into a USB slot for recharging (including solar recharging) -- the performance has been uneven and unpredictable with these.  They came in showing a very good charge right out of the package; oddly, the highest I have ever seen from rechargeables.  I'm still testing, but would alert buyers to the potential for radio interference (EMF), for some odd reason.  It has been particularly noticeable with a.m. radio.  They seem possibly okay for other non-audio and light-use purposes, such as a nose trimmer or small flashlight or clock, though the power drain has been unpredictable or sudden.  I will update as necessary after further use.\n",
      "Charges quick and hold its charge pretty well on Wii controller.  These Lithium Ion AA batteries are perfect for my Wii controller. So far it's holding its charges pretty well even after one hour of game play. I tried regular and NiCd and NiMd batteries on the controller and so far these are nice.Very convenient to charge by just plugging into my portable power bank usb slot. Light flashes red indicating its charging and took less then two hour lights shuts off indicating charge is full. Only slight downside is unlike typical Charger where you can charge two or four batteries at the same time you need to have available USB port to charge. It's convenient yet inconvenient if you need to charger more then 2 at the same time.But for what I need it for and having power bank with at least 2 USB ports this works for me.\n",
      "Better as a concept These lithium AA's are really a mixed bag. While it is \"convenient\" to be able to charge them with a USB without the need for an actual battery charger; they are also inconvenient to charge when you need to charge all 4.The capacity is also very low for a rechargeable AA at only 1200mah.I charged these batteries for 12+ hours (the lights on them never seem to turn off even when they are charged) and when I put them into a remote control car; they only lasted around 20 minutes before the car was low on battery.Overall this is a disappointing turnout as my conventional rechargeable last for 1.5 hours.The other issue is with charging all 4 batteries at once; you need 4 wall chargers or one charger with 4 ports to use to charge.I think I will end up using them for wall clocks or something where the power draw is low and I rarely will have to charge them (or so I hope).If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful! Thanks!\n",
      "Not Quite Up To Specs When it comes to physics, you don't get something for nothing. This has always been the case with rechargeable batteries which have tried to replace standard alkaline batteries. While companies have tried in the past to make rechargeable batteries that were the same size as AA alkaline batteries, there is always some kind of compromise. With older Ni-Cad rechargeable batteries the voltage was always far less than 1.5 Volts, the amount of time they lasted was always shorter and they would only recharge a few dozen times before they had to be thrown away.These new rechargeable batteries  use Lithium as their storage medium and while they do last far longer than their Ni-Cad counterparts, they still have a problem with not delivering the minimum 1.5 Volts that Alkaline batteries do. To be sure, they are much better than Ni-Cads, but the highest voltage that I could charge these batteries to was about 1.45 Volts. Although AA Alkaline batteries state that they run 1.5 Volts, the average AA battery produces around 1.64 Volts when they are brand new.While these voltage numbers do not sound like a huge difference, some very sensitive electronics are not \"fooled\" by the lower voltages and will not work correctly, if at all. If you are using batteries to run something very simple like a motor or a flashlight you will likely not notice any difference in performance other than that the motor may run slightly slower or the light may shine a little less brighter. If you are using these batteries to run something like a GPS receiver or a medical device the problem could be a bit more serious though.While these batteries come much, much closer to replacing disposable alkaline batteries than ever before, the technology is still not 100% there. For many simple devices these batteries are perfectly acceptable though.\n",
      "I hope these catch on! Aren't these the coolest things ever?  You don't need a battery charger, they have USB ports and charge up in about the same amount of time!  I'm very impressed and excited to get rid of my charger and use these instead!\n",
      "Will replace countless batteries My wife and I try to do our part for the environment. I found these and ordered them immediately. The pack of 4 come in a storage case, and are easily charged for use. Just take off the cap and plug into a USB port, when the red blinking LED indicator stop, it is ready. Put the cap back on and use in any device that uses AA batteries. I have been using them in a RC car to really put a drain on them and after 4 days of use, they finally needed a recharge. They last about the same and even a little longer than the top brand of Alkaline batteries. Now, I just recharge them, and use them again. No batteries going to the landfill today. These are rated for 1000 cycles. This 4 pack could ultimately replace 4000 AA alkaline batteries. That is a ton of money saved. Most of all, it is a ton of batteries not going in the trash and poisoning the earth. The batteries are very safe to use as they have built in protection circuitry for overcharging and discharging. They also have very important approvals by the FCC CE & RoHS. These are great batteries and we will be stocking up on these from now on. These are the best value when calculating how many batteries these will replace and the costs. I give these 5 stars for helping to save Mother Nature.\n",
      "These are SUCH a GREAT IDEA!!!!!! This has been a bad year for batteries for me. I've spent so much money on batteries only to have an appliance die a few weeks after installing the new batteries. I have a clock that powered through 6 batteries in 2 months. It may be the fault of the appliance or the battery, I'm not sure which but it's so frustrating.These solve allll of that! I just recharge them and pop them back into whatever device needs batteries. They charge super quickly, last a long time on one charge, have an indicator light telling you when they are charged, and they pay for themselves very quickly. I'm 100% satisfied with these!(I got a four pack. Any standard USB charger will charge these.)\n",
      "Cool idea Charged up pretty good and easy. Seem to be working good in a toy so far. Really cool idea for a rechargeable battery.\n",
      "Very convenient Great batteries with the most convenient way possible of charging.\n",
      "Quick to charge/Clear indication when fully charged/Excellent life off a full charge While I only have two batteries in my included photo, I was sent a total of 4 of these to review.Charge time is very quick on this batteries.There are clear light indications which let you know what stage in the charge process you're in. A red light blinks when each battery is charging; the red light turns solid when the charge cycle is complete; the red light turns off after a few minutes of a full charge being reached.Since charging these, I've had two in one of my gaming controls. I've since used that control at least 20 hours and my gaming indicator still shows more than enough life in the batteries. In short, these have very good battery life.At the price these are listed at and how they perform, I consider them to be a very strong value and I highly recommend them. In fact, I will be buying more of these outside of my review.Recommended5 starsCheers!\n",
      "Practical rechargeable batteries No need to keep track of a battery charger when you use these batteries. Instead they come open and plug directly into a USB charger. They remind me quite a bit of USB thumb drives. The only downside is that you need a lot of powered USB plugs if you want to charge all four. Since the batteries are a bit thicker than a USB cord, you can't plug them into ports next to each other on a multi-port plug (at least not the one I use). I did them in shifts of 2 batteries at a time, and they seemed to charge up in about an hour.The batteries so far have lasted well for me. I used them in my wireless mouse for this week and haven't had the batteries die. If I notice them draining more quickly than normal, I'll update my review.The batteries come with a carrying case, which helps me not lose them. I'm excited to use these in remotes and other places where I need AA batteries.\n",
      "Brilliant design! The batteries have a cap that removes to expose usb to plug in to provided charger.  It also comes with a nice carrying case.We use a LOT of AA batteries, so this will be quite the money saver being able to simply recharge instead of disposing and buying new.Rating is based on design and price.  What I've yet to determine is how long each charge lasts and how many charges each battery will take.  Will update if less than expected, which at this time I don't see as an issue!\n",
      "Brilliant This is a brilliant way to eliminate the need for a separate battery charger.  I love it, they're working perfectly.  Definitely recommend!  I'll be buying a bunch.\n",
      "AA Lithium Batteries Cell can be charged on my computer. I have been converting to rechargeable batteries so that I no longer need to use disposable batteries. I like that it can be plugged into a port for charging them up. It is also nice that they flash red until they are fully charged and then turn a steady red, so I know at a glance when they are done charging. It is interesting that there is a cap that slips over the charging tab, so that it is converted into a fully functional battery. I have purchased another brand that also includes a plug that allows you to have up to four batteries attached to it, allowing you to only have to use one port to charge up four batteries at a time. It would have been nice if this brand also had that feature.\n",
      "Genius idea if they held a charge longer First I was supposed to get 4 AA & 4 AAA but got 8 AA. After charging for 8 hours 1 wouldn't hold charge at all. I wouldn't recommend using in items with continuous use (ei. lights, radio, toys) for they do not last long between charge. Maybe fine for remote controls or a mouse something with very little drain.\n",
      "Don't waste your money These were bad. Bought them for a xbox one controller they didnt last long at all. Only pro I would say was the cables it comes with and they charge fast\n",
      "Won't get you very far if at all. Ordered two packs of four. 4 worked fine after initial charge. Other 4 never worked like new with a multimeter 3 charged to 1.4v DC and the last one only holds .4v DC new batteries. New batteries that don't fully charge.\n",
      "batteries did not charge I bought several sets (my bad) probably around 20 batteries.  Of all of them only one charged enough to light a small led flashlight.  It worked for almost 5 minutes.  You do not want to buy this.\n",
      "Horrible battery life I get a couple weeks of use in my mouse with dollar store batteries and I tried two of these ones in my mouse and they lasted for two days before they ran out of charge. I tried the next set and it didn't even last me the rest of the day. I charged them to full a couple days prior to using them in the mouse, so either they don't store well or have a very short use time.\n",
      "Just what I ordered. Haven't really put them to the test yet, but they seem to work fine. Just wanted to have something for power outages. These work great with my portable solar panels to charge them and battery powered string lights! Great prepper item to have, especially for vanlifers and off grid homesteaders.\n",
      "Not worth it to buy Product charges but dies quickly in remotes\n",
      "Not last long enough they do not last long for a room night light  that changes color\n",
      "Safety concern Stupid design, low capacity, have to charge frequently and the USB port gets hot so quickly, worried about safety.\n",
      "Long lasting We used lots of batteries and these batteries saved us money. It is long lasting and can be reused again because it can be recharged using a chord.\n",
      "View of the product I have not use it yet but it was how I was expecting ro see.\n",
      "Money saver These batteries have saved us so much money in my house. We were going through batteries like crazy between toys, controllers for RC cars, digital cameras, etc. Having rechargeable batteries has made not having to purchase batteries so much better. I was probably buying a pack of 48 every two months or so I would say. Now all I have to do is plug them in and we are good to go.They hold charge well we can take them anywhere and plug them in and have charged batteries in no time. I will definitely upgrade all of our batteries to rechargeable ones thanks to the experience I've had with these.\n",
      "never seen individual rechargeable batteries i have never seen individual rechargeable batteries. it’s actually really convenient cuz it use android usb charger, i keep 4 in my car and 4 at home. it came 2 chargers, each one can charge 2 batteries. this rechargeable batteries not like old fashion is so bulky...it actually charge up really fast, leave 4 in my car for emergency. like it\n",
      "Great money-saver pack of batteries First off, the savings alone is well worth it. With the kids home from school, they go through batteries for their gaming devices like water. These recharge quickly and seem to hold an even larger charge than regular batteries. The USB charging function is unique – never seen that before. I like it though. I can charge virtually all of these at once in a desktop USB dock. I'm pleased to have bought these.\n",
      "will not hold charge try as i might cant use these batteries for more than five minutes. hate writing a bad review  do not purchase\n",
      "Not great use for gaming. Bought the batteries for my son's Xbox controller .  After 2-3 hours of use was frustrated and stoped using them because they would not hold a charge. He would rotate 2 in the remote and 2 on charge and they would not keep up with his play time.\n",
      "waiting,for 4th battery to charge so far only 3 0f 4 batteries is charging.I am going to wait another 8 hours for that fouth battery to charge.If it does not charge i will be asking for another battery.I will send the defected battery back.\n",
      "They’re smaller then regular AA batteries. The batteries do fit well in my Xbox controller, they are to small.  And the micro USB cable is difficult to plug into the batteries.  I will not be buying more.\n",
      "4 stars because one of the led indicatirs is bad This actually works out in my case because it helps me identify the cells, but there's an led charge indicator and one of the cells shows discharged after 2 days of charging. It still works (I'm using it right now) but you can't tell if it's charged.\n",
      "Great Price! Fast shipping and great price! Going to make gaming with my non rechargeable controllers so much easier!\n",
      "Quickly loses charge Update:  I originally had a two star review, but the seller reached out to me and sent replacement batteries.  The replacements are working fine.  I use strictly for my Xbox one controllers.  Before re-reviewing, I charged all 4 batteries.  I then used 2 of them and they lasted about as long as a normal generic battery (around 20 hours).  I used a different set of batteries for the rest of the week, as I wanted to see if the others held a charge.  Upon placing the batteries back into the controller after a week of sitting around, I saw only a small degradation this time around (batteries didn't last quite as long, about 16 hours).  This batch out performed the initial batteries I received.  This review takes the following into account:The price of the batteries vs. the performance of the product. (I equate these to a set of how a generic battery would perform since it is over half the price of other USB batteries out there).Charge seemed to retain longer than the previous set that was sent.The charging time was my mistake.  These state that it should take about 4 hours to charge, so that is the norm for these batteries.The superb customer service I received.  I was contacted immediately about my initial score, and they asked to send replacement batteries to test (on their dime).  They initially sent the incorrect battery (AAA vs. AA).  I told them they sent the wrong battery and they quickly shipped out a replacement AA set.Used for my Xbox One controller.Pros:PriceIf charging batteries and using right away, they seem to work about as long as regular generic batteries.Con: If charging the batteries and storing for later use, the charge degrades within approximately one week, and will have to be recharged.The time to charge the batteries seems to fluctuate.  Charged set in about 45 minutes.  Charged same set later and it took over 4 hours (as indicated by the light within the battery).Since it seems to drain rather quickly, I don't think this would be a good product for T.V. remotes and the like.  You would have to charge them after about a week of use.  As far as using for game pads, they did seem to work well, but you would either have to time exactly how long the batteries work so you could start the charge on the other set to use quickly, or rely on other batteries while the set charges.\n",
      "The battery is easy to use and quick to charge. Good quality, like this product, USB charging is very convenient, at any time can be charged, with a charger can also be charged. Can Be put in my favorite lantern inside, this kind of battery is very environmental protection, can let me reuse, do not worry about battery pollution. That way, every day I can see the beautiful lights.\n",
      "Works great! Easy to use! The attached battery is safely packed in its own plastic container. Good. The battery from the battery to the charger is firmly connected. So far, the battery life is very good.\n",
      "Sufficient battery and unlimited use! I used to buy regular batteries. Buy a lot of stock. Because children's toys will not take long. Wasted a lot. This battery can be used for much longer than usual with a full charge. And it's easy to charge. With charging cable. No need to keep preparing a lot of batteries at home. This makes me very satisfied!\n",
      "Works well fit for travel Nice innovative and works well\n",
      "Novel idea! Better than alkaline! Rechargable batteries giving constant 1.5 volts and easy to charge up! However, the devices I use these in require frequent recharging even after a week, vs regular alkaline batteries lasting a little over a month of same usage. The octopus charger it comes with is short and can be dangerous if plugged into a usb charger and into a wall outlet. They just hang there. I use a different micro-USB cord, that's much longer, to charge each battery at a time. Takes longer but it seems less risky that way. These batteries give constant 1.5volts of energy, however with other batteries that slowly die, these just quit out of the blue. So they are either working at 100% or 0%. Which is good if you need that. You can recharge them from a battery powerbank. I wish the charging cord was longer as they dangle from the usb charging brick plugged into an outlet. That worries me.\n",
      "One dead AA on arrival Opened up the package and started to charge them when one of the AA batteries had no charging light. Could be DOA but the other ones are still charging. Time will tell if these last\n",
      "DO NOT get this to use in a MEDICAL DEVICE!!! UPDATE: I really need to stress how these batteries are NOT a good idea to use in a medical device.This keeps happening and putting me in dire situations, and it is entirely my fault cos I KNOW this.Whatever mechanism devices have to estimate the amount of charge doesn't work with these batteries. This means that your device will show that the battery is fully charged, and there won't be a warning before the battery goes dead. There is no way of knowing how long you have left. And because the use of your medical device can change a lot from day to day, there is no way you can even estimate an approximate time to replace it. I bought these to use in my insulin pump because the manufacturer recommends using lithium batteries. There have been so many times when I have been caught without an available replacement battery, and my insulin pump has died. I do carry the second one with me at all times because of this, but sometimes you are at the gym,  or taking out the trash (at the faraway dumpster of your apartment complex), or you just locked yourself out of your apartment, or doing some other activities, and the thing will die and send you in a frenzy because medical devices that are supposed to be on at all times have alarms (powered by an internal battery), because it is usually very DANGEROUS to have it power off without warning!=====================================================================They really don't last long between charges. And whatever mechanism devices have to estimate charge doesn't work with them, and there won't be a warning before they go dead. So its not a good use for medical devices, which is what I'm using them for. You better have replacements all the time.\n",
      "These have short life Do not waste your money. Charging port wastes too much battery capacity...\n",
      "The batteries work well and charge fast! These batteries arrived very fast! So far they’ve lasted several weeks on one charge (I use them in a remote control and mouse). The AA is 1200mAh and the AAA is 400mAh\n",
      "Convenience and longevity I have been using rechargeable batteries for years and as good as they are I did find them a little inconvenient to recharge, because I always had to go back to the main charging station in my office.  Bump's USB design is excellent!  I can now recharge my electric tooth brush in the bathroom, charge my wireless mouse in the office, and charge my spot light in the garage.So I am still saving money (maybe even saving a little more with this new polymer lithium technology), still helping the environment but now its a lot easier  :-)\n",
      "Super easy to charge works well. Like that you can charge anywhere. I'm using size AA in my apple wireless mouse,  just plug into my computer USB to recharge, works great and definitely seems to last longer than my single use alkaline batteries.\n",
      "Still works well after a month. Rather sleek and innovative recharging design. My only issue is the holder (clear plastic, picture 3) could be better. It's a snap latch I can foresee breaking off at a crease from the folding back and forth over time.The rest is great, and I should last a long time. The inputs on the battery itself proper are solid.I've never had a battery you literally plugin individually into a port before, normally you incase it and it charges on both the plus and negative side of it. I'd think some of this has to do with the new power and density of the lithium-ion battery, and the ability not to need as much as possible in the smaller space to best utilize it, which also makes sense for it there to be a potential for placing in the plastic case and using a AAA charge to power like a AA.\n",
      "Awesome and efficient Pretty cool. Charges fast and the cool little containers that turn a AAA into a AA is as cool or cooler than the batteries themselves.\n",
      "Works fine Cap fits very securely. Works well in the mouse I use for my computer.\n",
      "Best rechargeable batteries I just about gave up on rechargeable batteries that use traditional chargers. I threw all of my batteries away when I got this set. 2 AA with a removable cap that hides a standard USB plug. Just plug into a power cube or your computer USB ports and they charge in 1 hour. The AAA have a micro USB slot on them. They come with a 4 way USB cable. You just plug them in and the red light blinks until it's done charging. About an hour. The coolest thing is it comes with 2 clear battery adapters in which you place a AAA battery in and it becomes an AA battery.Excellent product.\n",
      "Great Batteries Great value for the price and so far they have been working great.\n",
      "Need more products like it Awesome product does exactly as it says.\n",
      "USB powered charged batteries This is a pack of 4AA batteries that are intelligently designed!  To charge your batteries, you just remove the top and place into any USB port.  VOILA... you are now fully charged (after a bit of time elapses).  The batteries arrive in a small clear carrying case which can be thrown in a bag or pocket.  Our son uses these batteries for his game controllers... those controllers eat batteries like they are going out of style.My only issue and this is a very scary one... the battery crashed his newish gaming computer once he plugged the battery into the USB port to charge.  We have charged the batteries off of wall plates, cell phone USB chargers and that one time we attempted, a desktop.  His computer instantly shut down/crashed and wouldn't reboot for a few minutes.  When we were able to get back on there was the blue screen stating that there was an issue.  We ran virus scans and some other programs because my son believed that it was a virus loaded onto the actualy battery which can kill a system once it is plugged in.  We couldn't substantiate this.  No one is allowed to plug these batteries into ANY computer because we are fearful.Can't recommend highly because of that computer glitch.  Besides that issue the batteries recharge quickly and hold their charge.  Afraid to think that someone may be spying or corrupting systems.  I hope not because I removed 2 stars because of that crash.\n",
      "Not Worth the Money Kind of cheap. Instructions are terrible. It was missing the blue piece for charging multiple batteries. Not recommended.\n",
      "Excellent alternative to alkaline or normal rechargeables An excellent alternative to normal rechargeable batteries, and way cheaper then using alkaline. If it lasts as long as it claims, it’s more than worth the price. I can’t say if they do yet, but the company says if they’re defective they’ll replace them so it does seem like they’re willing to stand behind their product. This set comes with 2 AA and 2 AAA, with 2 adaptors to turn the AAA into AA. If you need more AAA there’s another set with 4 AAA instead. For charging the AA battery’s tops pop off to reveal a standard USB plug you can charge in any USB outlet, the AAA ones have a micro-USB port on the side you charge with any micro-USB charger (they include one in the box). Personally I prefer the AAA’s micro-USB since they include a 4 port micro-USB charger, I had to use my PC ports to charge AA which wasn’t optimal, I wish they sold AA batteries with a Micro-USB port like the AAA. But hey that’s a minor quip, overall I still recommend these to anyone with electronics that like to eat up batteries.\n",
      "Cool in theory, but pain in practice The batteries are perfectly fine and last about as long as a typical battery. But EVERYTHING they are used for takes multiple batteries and having to find 4 USB chargers to charge them at the same time is where these fall flat. I’d recommend a set that you can easily charge, all at once.\n",
      "Good lasting item It's a good item. Only takes one charge port and charges without much difficulty. Comes with 4 batteries and a charger and 2 cases to convert to AAA size battery. Good value for money.\n",
      "Excellent!!! Super fast charging! Best rechargeable batteries I've ever had. Because I don't need a special receptacle. Just plug in the USB of a computer or wall charger. And I love the AAA-to-AA adapter. They charge fast.\n",
      "Highly recommend This is great!  I love being able to charge these batteries anywhere! What doesn't take USB nowadays?!  So far,  I'm impressed with the battery life.  It's been weeks since I placed it in my hands free trashcan.  My one year old likes to open and close it for laughs, so it gets used all the time and the batteries are holding up nicely.  I highly recommend.\n",
      "Rechargeable lithium AA batteries (and AAA batteries), with built in USB connectors and case This set of batteries comes with a case and includes batteries with built in USB connectors to use to recharge them when needed. This is a practical way to have reliable power at hand without needing a special battery charger. These batteries can work in many devices that you would have used alkaline batteries for. This is a cost effective battery option. I have tried both the AA pack and the AA/AAA combo pack and both types of batteries are working fine.\n",
      "Plug n play! Let's go! I like these a lot!  I love this idea of just plugging in the batteries with a cable to charge them instead of having to dig out a charger.  I mean we all have USB ports everywhere now - and I have a zillion cables - so it's easy enough to get these charged up.  They work well in my remotes and I'm happy to have 'em!\n",
      "Very Innovative! This is a really clever approach to rechargeable batteries. It is great not to have to use an additional battery charger, and with the way they configured these batteries, there are a lot of options on how to use them. They charged quickly in a USB, and work great.\n",
      "I love modern technology! I love these things!  I like rechargeable batteries, but who wants to dig out the charger that you already lost 10 times?  No worries here!  These things plug in with a simple cord to recharge!  I love that!  How cool is that?  I have these in remotes and can charge with cord which I have a million of already! Sweet!\n",
      "Great for travel, office, etc. But for every day use there are better options Battery has a LED indicator that flashes when charging, and stays on when full.These are lithium, and they should last years. Both the AA and AAA are the same strength (1500mah).The AA charge by normal USB, and the AAA are micro - so you don't really need the included adapter, you probably have phone cords lying around that will work, or just plug them into your laptopI think this great if you travel with devices that require AA or AAA, or if you need them at a work station (like rechargeable mouse, etc). Outside of those specific needs, I'm not sure it's a value - the \"gimmick\" on these, and the excuse for the high sticker price, is the USB charging. I'm really not convinced that it adds any convenience for day-to-day battery use, since you're limited by how many spare cables & USB ports you have at the moment.You can get a 16-pack of Amazon Basics AAs or AAAs for about the same price, and recharge them 4 or 8 at a time with a wall charger. I think that's a better bargain and definitely more convenient for my lifestyle.\n",
      "Super versatile set of rechargeable batteries This brand of rechargeable batteries has a few different sets, I went with the mix of 2 AAA, and 2 AA's which seemed to be the most versatile since the AAA size comes with an adapter to fit in AA if I need more AA's.Note that the AAA is smaller in 600 mWh capacity than the larger AA (1500 mWh) but that's the tradeoff in versatility with the size coverage. Also the AAA ones need a micro USB cable to charge (the set comes with a single USB cable split to 4 micro usb heads which more than covers the 2 included AAA batteries.The coolest feature that attracted me to these batteries was the AA heads come off and become a regular USB male plug that can go directly into any USB port like on a computer and charge directly without needing a separate cable or charger. This feature makes these so convenient as I don't have many devices that need batteries and didn't want the extra clutter of having a separate charger.I purchased these mainly for use with my Oculus Quest controllers which eat batteries very quickly, and so far the battery life even with the AAA's (on AA adapter) has lasted as long as the disposable AA batteries I had been going through. The investment in these batteries should more than pay off as I continue to use the Oculus, and even when I run into emergency needs for various controllers and remotes that run out.So far I'm really happy with these and hope that they continue to hold charge as they have been solid in a several days of continuous use.\n",
      "Smartest idea I've seen in a while These are so incredibly clever!  Charging the batteries in a USB port takes only about 30 min, and then I've replaced all of my wireless device's batteries with these so the remotes, mice, and various things should be simple to recharge and re-use.  I've only been using these for a couple of weeks, so no need to recharge yet, but I'm optimistic so far.\n",
      "Good thing the product page is detailed. There are no instructions included. The manner of charging the triple AAA batteries is fairly obvious. The double AA not so much. In the case of the later the top cap must be removed to expose the type A USB port under it. Also included is a charging cable for the AAAs, a case for all four batteries and two adapters to make the AAAs work as AAs..\n",
      "So far so good I've been using these in my mouse for about a month now, with no issues and it's still saying battery status is high.Charging was easy and quick. They fit perfectly, neither too big nor too small.My one complaint is that the AA have a red LED and the AAA have a green LED when they're charging. Kind of confusing at first, but not a big deal.\n",

      "So far so good What you get:2xAA-Li-ion USB batteries @ 1500mAh - Pull the end cap off, plug into a powered USB port (the stronger port on the left of my 2013 Macbook works, the port on the right does not). The manual does note that on desktop, it may be necessary to plug into the back of the computer as sometimes front ports are underpowered. Once the cap is replaced, it's identical to a AA battery. Very convenient. The indicator light on all batteries flashes during charging, and turns solid when done. The 1500mAh rating is also typical for a AA.2xAAA-Li-ion USB batteries @ 600mAh - These batteries require you to plug a micro-USB into the side, but otherwise look and feel just like a standard AAA.2xAAA>AA converters - Plastic caps with metal ends, snaps securely over a AAA to convert it to a AA, with only the AAA's smaller battery life. Super handy to have in a pinch.1x USB2.0 > 4x USB-micro adapter - Plugs into a standard USB 2.0 port, and provides 4 micro male plugs. You only need 2. Could be useful for travel when you need to recharge a lot of devices.1x AA Battery Case - Plastic case holding 4xAA batteries with latch. Nice.Overall - This is a great set. When in use, the batteries are identical replacements, and I haven't had a problem with any low-drain device (TV, Roku remotes). When these batteries are in use, you could keep emergency backups in the case, or even just keep the AAA>AA adapters in the case so you don't lose them. Very thoughtful. The micro-USB adapter is also nice. You may not need it if you already have a micro-USB device charging cable, but it's nice to have. Recommended.\n",
      "Great set This is a AA/AAA battery set with charging cable. In the set, you get 4 AAA batteries, 2 AAA to AA converter shells, a 4-way USB A charging cable (no transformer), and a plastic storage case for the batteries. Each of the batteries has a USB A micro slot on the side for charging.I find this set quite versatile. The batteries work well as standard AAA batteries. Or, you can put 2 of them in the converters and use them as AA batteries. The 4-way charging cord enables you to charge all 4 batteries at once. You can also charge the batteries in a standard AA/AAA battery charger if you prefer (not included). Overall, these batteries work well and are extremely handy for travel.\n",
      "Very cool batteries This is a set of 4 AA batteries with built-in USB A chargers. Each battery is standard AA-sized. The top pops off to reveal a USB A plug. Just plug the battery directly into any USB charger to charge it. The batteries come packed in a plastic storage case.I really like how handy these batteries are for charging. I can charge them in the USB ports of my laptop when necessary. The batteries seem to hold a charge about as well as other rechargeables that I have tried. The plastic case is handy. Overall, these batteries are extremely easy to recharge and work well.\n",
      "Always Have Fresh Batteries Save money and the environment by using these lithium rechargeable batteries.You need a USB charging socket. Everything else is included. You get two AA cells and two AAA cells. If you need four AA cells, two plastic tube-like adapters are provided to convert the AAAs to AA size.Charge all four batteries at once. Use the USB charging slot on your computer or separate USB charging device (the kind you use for your phone. I have a unit that charges several devices at once and it works fine for this.) The kit has a tree-like connector with four \"branches\" for the batteries. The AAA cells have sockets on the side. The AA cells have removable caps (see illustration in the listing.)The AAA cells blink green until the batteries are fully charged. You'll never have another dead remote.\n",
      "Rechargeable with options These rechargeable batteries provide options by a micro USB connection built into the side of the battery or I can use a recharger base. I can connect to a wall source or the laptop or power brick if I am traveling. The AAA to AA adapters are convenient when I need four AA batteries without the need to buy another set. Good to have to offset the cost of disposable batteries and the inconvenience of figuring out how to properly dispose of them.\n",
      "Fits any device that holds AA batteries Quite unique rechargeable batteries using a USB plugin.  They seem to hold a charge well. The caps are a little tight to take off and charging indicator is a bit confusing. I would assume these could be charged in a standard charger, but not sure.  As long as you have access to a USB, these work great.\n",
      "Review of both AA and AAA options I acquired both the AA and AAA options of these batteries. They differ slightly in that the AAA is charged using an included USB adapter (Micro-USB) that plugs into all 4 batteries, whereas the AA battery plugs directly into a USB-A port. While there’s no need for the adapter on the AA, note that each battery requires its own USB-A port (so charging 4 at a time means you need 4 open ports). Because the AAA uses an adapter, you only need one open USB-A port to charge all 4 at once.Both batteries have a built-in light that blinks when charging. Once the blinking stops, you know the batteries are full. A minor difference, but the AAA has a green light whereas the AA a red one.Note that neither battery came with a wall charger. You will need your own source. I tested different options to see if any had issues. First, I used my fast charger from my OnePlus 7 Pro phone. Then I used an older (slow) wall charger for my Apple iPad. Finally, I used USB ports on my computer and a HUB connected to my computer. All options charged the batteries without issue.The Huahui AAA comes with capsules that convert them to AA. Unfortunately, there are 4 batteries but only two capsules. From what I tested; they definitely work. But I admit the capsules do feel a little cheap, and they are slightly longer than a true AA battery. I measured an AA Duracell at 1.96” (inches) and the Huahui AAA in the AA capsule at 1.98”. Not a huge difference at .02”, but if the device you are putting them into is picky, it may cause some problems. Additionally, the Huahui AAA battery itself is slightly larger (1.74”) than a AAA Duracell (1.72”). Again, that’s only a .02” discrepancy, but something to keep in mind.The Huahui AA on the other hand is the exact same length as the AA Duracell. Both measured in at exactly 1.96”. So, they should work in any device that takes AAs.The diameter of both batteries is spot on. I was even able to slide the Huahui AA into the very tight compartment on my Apple Magic Trackpad.I also tested these batteries (both AA and AAA in capsule) on my Wireless Xbox and Wii U controllers. Worked great. And both batteries were detected as having a full charge.While many devices today have built-in lithium-ion batteries, there are still many things that require traditional batteries. From flashlights, to remotes, to shaving devices. I love these Huahui batteries because they charge directly into a USB port rather than needing an external charger. Makes it super easy to transport and charge on the go, especially considering you can just pop them into a power bank. So far, I’m loving them and have had no issues.\n",

      "Overall a great battery and great idea! Rechargeable batteries always seem like such a great idea. But you have to use a charger and they end up being more hassle than you realize.The Huahui USB Rechargeable AA Batteries Lithium Ion ECO-Friendly&Recyclable Double A High Capacity 1500mWh/1.5V Quick Charging for Camera/Fan/Mouse/Toy/Remote Control/Flashlight/Shaver(4 Pack) gets rid of the charger and makes it very easy to recharge the battery.All you do is VIGOROUSLY remove the positive terminal to reveal a MALE USB prong and plug it into a computer, or other charging device, and when it is charged, you have a battery ready to go again.This four pack comes in a convenient plastic case. The concept is simple and so far I don't see a big problem with battery life. I was a little worried that the space needed for the USB prong would take away space for the battery - and it does. But I don't know that it affects battery life enough to matter.To be fair, I am using them in a low current situation. I think these are awesome for remote controls. When they run down, you just charge them overnight and you are ready to go! FOR REMOTE CONTROLS, it doesn't get any better than this.The only real negative I see is making sure you don't lose the cap/positive terminal when charging. They could have possibly included some sort of wire or string/cable that kept it attached but it is a SMALL ISSUE.Overall, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND these to someone looking to replace a remote control battery. For a high current draw situation, like a toy, or something else - I would look elsewhere as you do have less battery to work with. But overall, for many uses these are excellent!Aplus!!!Thank you for reading my review. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via my Amazon Profile page and I will get back to you as soon as possible. I hope you found this review helpful. Thanks!\n",

      "Great Idea, Works Well These batteries are a great concept. I do not like having to have chargers lying around for batteries.They are all different. The easily plug into our outlets with the built-in USB ports. They can be essentially plugged into any USB device to charge.The battery life so far is excellent. We are using these in game controllers. We go through a lot of batteries with these controllers. I am hoping to save some money long term. The cost of these batteries is the about the same as a 48 pack on Amazon of any leading brand AA battery. With our game controllers that pack will last 6-8 months. If these last for at least 1 year I am ahead. I'll update this review if anything changes.\n",
      "Hi-tech and great value. Will save me money and time buying batteries for years! I look forward to saving a lot of money not having to constantly buy AAA batteries for my kids toys. Cool design and can recharge over 1k times. Wow! The company also stands behind product.\n",
      "💞💓💯💪👍Totally Different Paradigm in Portable Rechargeable Batteries/Charger 👍💪💯💓💞  We all love anything that's rechargeable and reusable, not only it saves us money, but we help save Mother Earth at the same time. Hence, chances are that you have the old way of recharging your AA or AAA batteries, that is, some sort of NiMH rechargeable batteries and a charger set. Trouble is the typical charger is a little heavy, hence not as portable, or you put it up against a wall outlet standing vertically - the batteries sometimes would fall out of the charger or the entire batteries/charger will fall to the floors due to the poor design of its weight distribution. Well, fuss no more, here comes the Huahui AA+AAA Batteries Rechargeable USB Lithium Batteries ECO-Friendly High Capacity 1.5V Rapid Charging with 4in1 Charging battery set.Here's why I love them at first sight:#1. There's no actual charger - this saves materials and reduce plastic waste. Instead, you get a micro-USB port on each of the batteries, whether AA or AAA. This battery charging set also comes with a special octopus-like (well, more like a quad-pus) charging adapter cable, with one end typical USB Type-B end, and the other end micro-USB connectors. You simply plug each of these 4 connectors directly onto the micro-USB ports on the battery, then you  plug the USB-Type B end into any USB-AC power adapter that everyone has lying around into any electrical outlet#2. Lightweight & Portable: again, due to the lack of a bulkier charger, you're more likely to want to take it on-the-go while on a business trip or vacation, as long as you bring the special quadpus cable, it takes up nearly no room at all#3. Versatility: in the box, you get 2 AA and 2 AAA batteries, PLUS two AAA ==> AA plastic adapters. If you insert the two AAA into this plastic adapters, you essential just turn these two AAA into ANOTHER two AA batteries. Hence, this set of batteries basically provide you with: 1) 2 AA and 2 AAA or 2) 4 AA batteries (with the help of special adapters), how cool is THAT! 👍💪💯💓💞👍💪💯💓💞👍💪💯💓💞👍💪👍$4. Fast Charging: these four batteries take only an hour to get fully charged! While charging, you get this flashing green light show, when fully charged, you get SOLID green and the batteries are ready for use!#5 Eco-Friendly: the best beneficiary of this set of rechargeable battery set is Mother Nature, this will help reduce throwing away more non-rechargeable batteries into local landfillsIn SUMMARY, the Huahui AA+AAA Batteries Rechargeable USB Lithium Batteries ECO-Friendly High Capacity 1.5V Rapid Charging with 4in1 Charging Set presents a new paradigm in rechargeable batteries. NO separate charger is needed, instead, through the use of a special QUAD-pus cable which you'd insert DIRECTLY onto these rechargeable batteries micro-USB ports. Along with special cylindrical adapter permitting the flexibility of turning the 2 AAA batteries into another 2 ADDITIONAL AA batteries IF your situation require more AA batteries than AAA.Not only you'd feel good producing less waste but you'd actually want to take them EVERYWHERE!💞💓💯💪👍HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💪💯💓💞\n",
      "unsalted batteries OK the 4 star rating is for the batteries AS batteries in that they seem to work just fine and I expect they will continue to do so for quite a whileAs to their \"specialness\": I admit they are cool and unique and... okay, I'm a luddite but I don't see the need for them as opposed to any other decent re-chargeableTrue, you don't need a charging base. On the other hand you DO need the, much more easily loseable , USB connectorAnd the top removal of the battery to get to the USB plug leaves you with ANOTHER easily misplaced partIt's not unlike the plethora of new electronics that you start by saying \"go on\" which relieves you of the onerous and time/energy consuming drudgery of pushing a button!As my old pappy used to say: \"Just because you CAN do something. doesn't mean you MUST\" (Oh, and he said it in Polish)\n",
      "AAA Batteries USB Rechargeable Lithium recharge fairly quickly I find myself needing more AAA Batteries  for my devices, and these are the easiest to recharge and do so fairly quickly. Since I am sitting in front of my computer all the time, it is very easy to plug the charger cord into the port, and since the plug can handle four AAA at a time, it is very easy to recharge them and insert them back into my device. Also, unlike the more conventional rechargeable batteries, these will remain at full capacity until it runs out of energy, so I don't experience any dimming or gradual loss of power. They run at full power until they run out and then they go dead all at once. I plan to buy more of them soon.\n",
      "Radiant rechargeable batteries! Never go with batteries! When these get low, just use the plugs to charge them! No bulky charge box needed.\n",
      "Radiant rechargeable batteries! Never go with batteries! When these get low, just use the plugs to charge them! No bulky charge box needed.\n",
      "Great idea, low capacity. I am a big fan of USB-rechargeable Lithium batteries, mostly because they provide the 1.5V of alkaline batteries, which makes them more universal than NiMH or NiCd batteries with 1.2V. Most devices learned to deal with the difference, but some simply work better with the full voltage even if the difference is only 0.3V.The tip lights up green and blinks when charging, while turning steady once full. The included AAA-to-AA adapter may be useful for emergencies, but I don’t use them as the reduced capacity of these batteries (600 mAh) is really small compared to a standard AA with 2400 mAh.The USB charging is a great idea and thanks to the space constraints in a AAA battery, the USB-A connector  doesn't fit. I like that only because the USB-A version in the AA batteries sounds like a great idea, but even charger blocks with four USB outlets don't work well as the size of the battery is typically smaller than the diameter of the AA battery, allowing only every other slot to be used. With the microUSB forcing a harness of sorts, it's great to find a single harness included that fans out from a single USB-A to four microUSB plugs.Even if microUSB is probably the worst USB design of them all (sometimes very difficult to plug in right), it's still the dominant form factor even for new devices, despite USB-C being around for a while now. So if you lose the harness, you can probably easily find four USB-A to microUSB \"laying around\".Once plugged in, charging of all four batteries at the same time take as mere 0.5A at 5.2V. It doesn't take long for all four to be charged, either. That seems a bit odd, but turns out to be a byproduct of the low capacity of only 600 mAh per  battery. A standard alkaline AAA battery is typically rated at 1000 mAh (or nearly double). So you pay the price for convenience in longevity of the charge.So these are not the longest lasting batteries, but the voltage and over 1000 charges may make up for it for low power applications. I tried three of them in a nightlight rated at 0.7W, and the batteries were depleted after 5 days despite short illumination cycles (by using motion sensor). That is certainly not the place to use these batteries, but devices like remotes should work well.\n",
      "Super handy This is a set of 4 rechargeable batteries in AAA size, plus 2 cases to convert 2 batteries at a time to AA size. Each of the batteries has a USB micro charging port near the top. You can also recharge the batteries in a regular battery charger. The 2 AAA to AA converter cases are made of translucent plastic. Just slip an AAA battery in and then the battery will fit in an AA battery compartment. Also included in the kit are a USB A to 4x USB micro charging cable  (transformer not included) and a plastic case to hold the 4 AAA batteries.I find these batteries super-handy, especially for travel. You never know which batteries are going to fail in your devices, AAA or AA. With these batteries, you can carry the one set of batteries and use the converter cases if you need to replace some AAs. The quad-charging cable is also quite cool, something I’ve never seen before. With this cable you can charge all 4 batteries at once using up just one USB slot on your charging device. So you don’t to carry around a separate battery charger. Overall, this set is extremely handy for travel and a great way to save on batteries in the long run.\n",
      "Easy to use I got these because I'm concerned about the number of batteries that I throw out each month/year. They just end up incinerated or in the dump which isn't good for anyone especially our precious environment. So I figured using more rechargeable/reusable batteries would be a good way to start. They're easy to recharge and all of the equipment is small and doesn't take up a lot of space. Apparently they can be reused/recharged over and over again for 1000 times or so. That's really exciting and I think that there's definitely ya lot of future potential for having these and not have to buy batteries again! :)\n",
      "recharges fast Getting the cables into the batteries require a bit of effort, but once attached and plugged into a usb port, the batteries charge fast.  I tested them in several devices, one device failed to work with the batteries, but the device didn't work when I tested other brands, so the problem is probably with the device not batteries.  I can never find  batteries in the house when I need them, rechargeables are the way to go.\n",
      "Simple to recharge, saves so much money on high consumption items These batteries are simple to charge, they are charged with a micro USB in the side of it. This set comes with a USB splitter with 4 micro USB ends to charge all 4 batteries at the same time. The box also included an adapter to make the AAA into slightly too big AA batteries.The life of the batteries is right on par with standard batteries, I use the batteries in a headlamp I use on a daily and have to replace the batteries at least once a week so these will really save some money in the long run for me.\n",
      "Convenient to charge these Li-Ion AA by just plugging into any USB port  Came nicely packaged in a little carrying case. Love the concept you don't need a charger to recharge these li-ion AA batteries just by removing the cap and plug into any 5v USB port.Each battery takes about an hour and half to fully charge and you can tell when the flashing red light becomes solid.Downside to charge all 4 batteries you need 4 USB port. Wish it allow to be charge on a charger too so this way you can use the usb as a backup if you are outside and don't have access to a charger.\n",
      "💞💓💯💪👍 Most Ingenious & Versatile Rechargeable Batteries I've EVER Seen 👍💪💯💓💞  Unlike more traditional rechargeable batteries + charger set, you get a seet of AA/AAA NiCD NiMH rechargeable batteries and a separate charger where you'd insert these batteries into.  These Huahui Li-ion AAA USB Rechargeable batteries are complete a breath of fresh air to me, as I've never come across anything quite like these.First, unboxing revealed that you get 4 rechargeable AAA Li-ion batteries with a built-in micro-USB charging port on each, you also get a set of two adapters, where you can insert these AAA batteries into the plastic adapter turning them into AA batteries (see my photos and video), and you also get a special cable with one end a typical USB Type B and the other 4 microUSB on the other ends. You can charge these AAA Li-ion rechargeable batteries all at once, while charging, you will see green beam like a light show - really cool and very convenient!Second, because no separate charger is needed, you get a very small & lightweight package that takes up nearly no room at all, and are more willing to take it along with you when travelling.Third, these 4 batteries charged fully in less an hour and ready for use on devices such as my nose hair trimmer, optical mouse, etc.Finally, as an eco-conscious dude, it's good to know that these batteries are eco-friendly and recyclable so I know I'm doing to my part to minimize negative impact on Mother Nature.The VERDICT==========Huahui AAA Batteries USB Rechargeable Lithium High Capacity 1.5V Fast Charging requires no separate charger, unlike traditional rechargeable charger + batteries combo unit. These special batteries have a micro-USB charging port onboad each of the 4 AAA batteries, in addition, 2 sets of special adapters can turn these into AA batteries, so in essence, it's effectively like you get either 4 AAA batteries, or 2 AAA & 2 AA batteries! HOW GOOD IS THAT! These batteries are also eco-friendly and recyclable with minimum damage on Mother Earth. Because no separate charger is needed, it's easy to take it on the go, on a business trip or summer vacation. If like me, you've never used one of these rechargeable batteries with mirco-USB charging ports on board, you're missing out! Get THEM, you will not be disappointed!💞💓💯💪👍HIGHLY RECOMMENDED👍💪💯💓💞\n",

      "Combo set of AA and AAA uses a direct USB plug in for the AA batteries integrated into the battery. The AAA batteries use a side port to plug in the USB harness/splitter.  The AA batteries can have the top pole popped off and directly plug into a full size USB charger port.  The life of these batteries is good enough to more than justify the price not having to replace batteries all the time in my remotes and other devices is a good thing. Plus an answer to the question I posted, says they will work in a rechargeable device like a cordless phone, so you don't have to only charge them outside the device by USB.  If this is like a typical lithium after charging if you don't use right away it should hole that full charge for a considerable long time much longer than typical batteries or rechargeables.  Recommended.\n",
      "Works with USB charger and my answered question, it works with charging inside rechargeable gear. Clever design of the harness and the use of micro USB connectors to plug into the actual batteries.  Plus, since it can be charged via the poles you can use it with rechargeable phones, shavers, and other devices that charge with the batteries inside.  It should save me a quite a few dollars of buying alkaline batteries and use once lithium cells.  The harness I mentioned uses a full size USB as the source connection then has four micro USB connections that plug into the side of the batteries.  Kit includes some cheater sleeves to use these as AA's if so desired.  The price is worth the money if it comes anywhere near the 1000 charges.  Battery is resistant to building a memory like some of the older design rechargeable types, so you can typically charge at any level.  Cells have plastic translucent snap case for storage if not in use.  Recommended.\n",
      "electrifying idea! Rather that spend $ after $ on ordinary batteries,  and fill up the landfill or recycler with the dead bodies, why not just get a \"Huahui USB Rechargeable AA Batteries Lithium Ion ECO-Friendly&Recyclable Double A High Capacity \"?Easy to use, fast to recharge, and  will save you money and aggravation over time!\n",
      "Little expensive but easy to recharge while on the go. What I love best about these rechargeable batteries is they are perfect for travel items. They do not require a fancy proprietary battery charger. It comes with a 4 split micro usb cable which u can plug into any USB port to charge. They are perfect for a wireless mouse, alarm clock, toothbrush etc. my son said they worked well in his xbox controller which surprised me. The AAA is 1000 mwh the AA is 1500 mwh.  They come with a holding case and the two AAA have an adapter to make them into a AA. I think that’s awesome.  The AA recharge by pulling the cap off and plugging into a usb. The cap is a little tricky to pull off.  I was trying to twist it at first.  They recharge in about an hour. The mouse showed me they were 100% charged after charging. I do think they are pricey at $25. For 4 rechargeable no super powerful batteries but I guess you are paying for the easy convenience of recharging on the go.\n",
      "Nice versatile set of rechargeable batteries I love these batteries.  They are easily rechargeable without the use of an additional charging station.  The set comes with a USB cord that splits to 4 micro USB ends.  As well as 2 AA batteries, 2 AAA batteries and 2 adapters for AAA batteries to be used like AA batteries.The USB portion of the cable can be plugged into a computer or a charging block.  The micro USB ends get plugged into the side of the battery.  Being that there are 4 ends you can plug in and charge up to 4 of the AAA batteries at the same time.  The AA batteries however do not connect to the micro USB connector the plug directly into a USB port or charging block.The batteries take about an hour each to charge.  So, if you plug in all 4 at the same time you only need to wait 1 hour for 4 fully charged batteries.  The AAA ones are easy to do this with because they go on the same charging cable that splits 4 ways.  The AA's however go individually unless you use  USB hub.  You remove the cap to charge them but, the first time it may be especially difficult to remove the cap it does sit pretty tightly on there and it will only go back on in one direction.  While charging there is a flashing light on the end (green for AAAs and red for AAs) which changes to a steady light once fully charged.  These hold a charge well and last about as long as other rechargeable batteries I've used.  They also came with two adapter cases that allow you to use the AAA batteries as a AA battery which makes them even more versatile.\n",
      "Rechargeble batteries I love these batteries.  They are easily rechargeable without the use of an additional charging station.  The set comes with a USB cord that splits to 4 micro USB ends.  The USB portion can be plugged into a computer or a charging block.  The micro USB ends get plugged into the side of the battery.  Being that there are 4 ends you can plug in and charge all 4 batteries at the same time.  The batteries take about an hour each to charge.  So, if you plug in all 4 at the same time you only need to wait 1 hour for 4 fully charged batteries.  While charging there is a green flashing light on the end which changes to a steady light once fully charged.  These hold a charge well and last about as long as other rechargeable batteries I've used.  The also came with two adapter cases that allow you to use the AAA battery as a AA battery which makes them even more versatile.\n",
      "Do you go through a lot of bateries and want to cut down your waste I love these batteries!  If you want rechargeable batteries these are great because you don't have to have an additional charger to charge them in you can plug them into any USB port or a charging block and they will charge.  The caps were a little difficult to pull off the first time but have been fine after that first time.  The cap will only fit on in one direction when you put it back on.  These take about 1 hour each to charge though so if you want them all to charge at the same time I think the best way is to use a hub with 4 ports.  While charging, these have a flashing red light at the end which will become a steady light once fully charged.  They hold a charge well and last about as long as other rechargeable batteries I've used.This brand also has AAA batteries but those have a slot on them that you insert a micro USB cord into as opposed to taking off the cap and plugging the battery into a USB port  I kind of wish they had just used the same design on the AAs since the caps can get lost making the battery unusable.  Or at least the cap could be attached in some way so that it would be easier to keep track of.\n",
      "An interesting set I have another set of usb-rechargeable batteries and like the idea of being able to recharge them on one of my usb charging stations.  The AAA batteries, for me, were \"typical\" with the small usb-c (I believe that is the designation for it) opening on the side of the battery, but the two AA batteries are different, having a \"cap\" of the positive post that pulls off to reveal a traditional usb plug.  I have not inserted any of the batteries into an item yet, but I am sure they will work just fine.  My own personal opinion is that I prefer the way the AAA batteries charge.  I found that the AA ones cannot be plugged in next to each other as they are round and take up too much space based on how the usb ports are arranged on any of my charging stations.  Other than that, these are great to have - one can never have too many charged batteries!\n",
      "The AAA is iffy and works when it wants The concept is very nice BUT for some reason the triple A works when it wants to. Take to cap of at the top of the batteries and you can charge in your PC or USB capable unit. On the side of the batteries you can use the adapter to also charge them. They take about an hour and they can be used in most items that take batteries.\n",
      "Best invention since sliced bread I don't know why it took me so long to discover these batteries. or maybe they are a recent invention. Regardless, they are wonderful. I do not like using disposable batteries for the obvious environmental cost.Most people throw away batteries in the regular garbage can and they must be disposed of properly. That's why I favor rechargeable batteries. But when you're traveling, rechargeable batteries are a pain because you have to take the charging station, which is often bulky. It also robs you of another plug in your hotel room, and you may not have that many plugs. That's why this is such a great invention because you can plug it into any standard USB port and it will recharge your batteries. I like the fact that each battery has a little red indicator light that blinks to show you that it's being charged and when it is finished charging.The price is reasonable for the amount of recharges you get. They also have a AAA battery version. The capacity for the double a batteries is 1,500 milliwatts. I hope the photos are helpful. When the battery is fully charged, it stays on. While it's charging, it's blinking.These are made in China. When you use up enough charging cycles, you still need to dispose of it properly.\n",
      "Not too bad... We are trying to be more \"green\", or as green as we can,. so I've been stocking up on rechargeable batteries. Less to throw in the trash.These are like other batteries I have, they too use a special cord to plug in, to charge. Personally I am not a fan of this idea, because it's yet another cord laying around the house, or something I need to find when I want to charge them. But it doers work and not a fault of the product.This is the first set of batteries I've had that include a converter to AA. Really just plastic tubes, but they work. Just wonder how they will last. They do seem pretty durable. Guess it would be nice to be able to use them as AA or AAA.Plugged them in to a USB port and they started charging. They work as they should. So far they have worked in the few devices I've tried, so no compatibility issues yet. Will be sure to update this if I run into any trouble.All said, they seem like  pretty good batteries, the only slight negative I have is that they seem a little pricey for what they are. But that is just my opinion.\n",
      "Great Find! In this day and age, it’s hard not to buy stock in a battery company with the amount of double and triple As that you go through for almost every digital device! I have tried other rechargeable batteries in the past without much success. They took forever to charge, and didn’t hold a charge long enough to make it worthwhile to wait for them to charge up again.With this set, I have to admit to being impressed! They charge quickly, maybe having something to do with the USB method, which I had not seen in a battery charging set before. They also hold a charge through a lot of use. They still don’t maintain the length of charge that I get from a regular battery, but it is long enough, and the recharge short enough to satisfy me! I’d much rather use these and help do just that little extra moe for the environment!\n",
      "45 min quick charge all 4 AAA batteries at once  These Lithium Ion AAA rechargeable batteries are so convenient because you don't need a charger. All you need is any micro usb cable or the cable that comes with the set that can be plugged in on the side of the batteries and charge 4 all at the same time. Takes about 45 minutes to completely charge them all which is pretty fast.The green light will flash while its charging and when it's complete it stays solid green. Way to charge theee are limitless, because you can use wall adaptor, plug into your laptop or in my case I plug into my portable powerbank so it's even portable when you are out camping.It comes with 2 AA shell where you can put this AAA inside the shell and work as AA batteries.What I like about lithium ion rechargeable that they don't have memory like NiMh so can charge anytime and they hold the charge longer too.\n",
      "mindblowing  I have dozens of USB chargers, but only three AA/AAA battery chargers and only one that can charge batteries individually. With these Huahui USB Rechargeable AA Batteries, I'm not depending on any charger and USB chargers are everywhere. The battery capacity is slightly bigger what I usually use from other big brands, and I like that little magnet is holding in place the +cup.\n",
      "great  These Huahui USB Rechargeable AAA Batteries are working great in my multiple remote controllers. They have less capacity compared with those well-known brands, but the three different ways of charge, making them perfect tools at home or on my travel as well. The type C connect would be a huge step up.\n",
      "Unique design, with room for improvement I have both the AAA and AA version of these batteries which have built-in chargers. They both perform well thus far and the design eliminates the need for a separate battery charger because you simply plug the batteries into a USB port to charge them. While the AA version has the USB plug built into the tip of the battery, the AAA ones (due to their smaller size) have a micro USB port on the side and come with a 4-way cable so you can charge all four at the same time from one USB port.It's a good concept in theory, but not the easiest to use. First, the batteries are black and the port is black as well, very small, and keyed so the plug can only go in one direction. I spent a good bit of time trying to get all the plugs into the batteries, which I found annoying and feel that it may not be something I'm willing to continue doing. If they had made the battery a brighter color so the port was easier to see and additionally used a USB-C port, which can be plugged in either way, this would have improved the design significantly and made them much easier to use. Making these changes would make this a solid 5-star product.Time will tell on battery life, but I would expect them to last longer than standard batteries since lithium batteries typically last longer.Overall decent product and good value with room for improvement\n",
      "Very clever design and works well These batteries have a very clever design, in that they simply plug into any standard USB port to charge, eliminating the need for a separate battery charger. You just remove the end up which revels the USB plug. The top rim of the battery flashes while charging and turns solid when complete. Then, just unplug and replace the cap.Thus far they've all been working well. Will have to see over time how long they last compared with standard batteries, but I have expectations that they should last longer since lithium batteries typically have a longer life.Great, very unique, and reasonably-priced.\n",
      "Simple to charge, awesome design These batteries are simple to charge, the AA version has a removable cap to plug directly into a standard USB port and the AAA version is charged with a micro USB in the side of it. This set comes with a USB splitter with 4 micro USB ends to charge the AAA batteries. The box also included an adapter to make the AAA into slightly too big AA batteries.The life of the batteries is right on par with standard batteries, I use the AAA in a headlamp I use on a daily and have to replace the batteries at least once a week so these will really save some money in the long run for me.Really neat idea for a rechargeable battery but if I could make a change on them I would have the AA charge the same way as the AAA. I don't have unlimited USB ports to charge things off of and usually end up having to charge one AA at a time where as the AAA can all be charged together.\n",
      "So far so good I’ve only had these a short time, but so far, so good. They charged quickly and are working great in my remote and mini flashlight. Ultimately it seems cheaper than constantly replacing regular alkaline batteries. I bought a second set for VR controllers, but I haven’t used those yet. I’ll update the review if anything goes wrong, but I think this was a good investment\n",
      "A great product for things that need 1.5V This is great for something that you want to recharge but also need 1.5V.These batteries charge via a USB port and also via a normal AA battery charger.I asked the seller and they got back to me within the same day.I am very happy with these batteries.\n",
      "Never knew I needed these After never using rechargeable batteries before, I now own a set of both AAA and AA batteries.  These AA are great for the few devices I own that require that size.  I would say most of my devices have internal rechargeable batteries in them, but the few remaining that need batteries work great with these.  This saves me a lot of money and space, not having to buy a lot of batteries in bulk, holding onto them until they are needed.  As I only need a few at any given time, this four pack is perfect for my needs.  They are intuitive and easy to set up and utilize.  A must have!\n",
      "Works great This is my first foray into rechargeable batteries.  I had no idea what to expect with the whole process and actual use of the batteries.That being said - these are very easy and intuitive to charge and then use.  Once charged, they work great in the devices I plug them into.  This is a great set as I don't have too many devices that use AAA, so I will never be too long without a battery, as it is simply a recharge away from full power.\n",
      "Love it pretty unique battery fast charging First time see something amazing lime this so far works awesome in my xbox control would be nice if they sold adapter to charge this battery all at ones\n",
      "AA works perfectly, AAA is hit or miss. Huahui's AA and AAA Li-ion batteries are a great way to combine new technology with an old form factory.  The batteries come packaged in a plastic case.  The AA batteries have a pull off top for the positive terminal.  Under the top is a USB-A socket.  These plug directly into a USB socket to charge the battery.  The AA batteries blink red, and when charged become a solid red.  They take about an hour to charge.The AAA batteries have a charging port on the side.  Included is a special USB-A charger that will charge all 2 AAA batteries at once.  The batteries blink green, and when charged become a solid green.  They take about a half hour to charge.I used the batteries in a variety of my son's toys.  The AA batteries worked perfectly, while the AAA were hit or miss.  In some toys the AAA worked flawlessly and in others they had to be jiggled around a bit to get to work.  Still other won't work no matter what I did.  I did notice that they are a little taller than a regular AAA battery, so that may be the issue.All in all... great rechargeable batteries.\n",

      "I rate these batteries... a Strong BUY PROS:- Very easy to charge all 4 at once with a 4-way USB charger.  A green light blinks during charging and lights-up steady when charging is complete.- They last a good amount of time, of course it all depends on the frequency of use.- My 4-pack came with 2 \"AA\" shells which I can place 2 \"AAA\" into and they will then fit into devices that require \"AA\", there will be a lower duration of power of course.CONS:- None.\n",
      "Great These are awesome batteries, they charge fast and seem to last a good amount of time. The great thing is, no special charger is needed.\n",
      "Fantastic! These things come with a charging plug with 4 ends that enable you to charge all four batteries at once. They come in a really nice hard plastic storage box too. They also come with the coolest thing: They come with 2 AA Size empty shells that you can put one of these AAA batteries in each one and actually have a Working AA set of batteries. I’ve never seen that before and I’m loving that little bit of Tech.  I have 2 of these in my TV Remote and they’re working great. They’re supposed to hold a charge longer than a regular battery and last around 1,000 charges. I’m very happy with them!  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁\n",
      "Too Cool! These are definitely a huge step up from any Rechargeable Batteries I’ve ever had. These actually stay charged as a regular battery would, compared to my old rechargeable batteries that were only good for immediate use because, they would lose charge if they were used or not, quite quickly. These are awesome!  They charge by simply pulling off the cap of one end and it plugs into any USB Charger. They’re new for me but, if they stay charged as long as they say and last for the 1,000 or so charges that they say, these will be well worth it. They’re working perfectly and get 5 Stars. I’ll update if things change.  Stay Healthy Everyone!😁\n",
      "Good so far! Admittedly, this is an unusual design for rechargeable batteries - having a micro-USB that plugs directly into the batteries for charging is something I've never seen before, but, so far, it's working just fine!You get everything seen in my pictures - 4 AAA batteries in a plastic case, 2 AA-size cases that you can put the AAAs in to use in something that needs AAs (another interesting accessory I've never seen before), and lastly the USB cable with 4 micro USB connectors for the batteries.When charging, one end of the batteries light up and blink green, and when charged, they'll stay solid green.Overall they're working just like any other AAA battery so, I'm satisfied!\n",
      "Love this product I absolutely love these batteries for my blink cameras. I wish they offered a 20 set so i can have a large backup quantity. They last a long time, easy chargeable.\n",
      "Reduce pollution Their quality matches that of brand-name products, and the battery works well. These are very convenient to use. I use batteries for my battery powered candles.  I have been using them for a while and they have been working great with no issues. Charge quickly and works long. Better and cost effective than single use batteries.\n",
      "Good Batteries, Good Support from Nanfu I bought 8 of these batteries form \"Nanfu Direct\" last year. Recently found that 2 batteries were dropping to ZERO volts. I contacted Nanfu requesting help and if possible 2 batteries as replacement, and they very quickly replied and send 4 new batteries.Since they pump out a constant 1.5V, they get consumed faster than normal rechargeable batteries. They are also little smaller in mAh capacity (180 mAh) as compared to the usual 2500mAh rechargeable. They also charge very fast.5stars for the Nanfu customer support and 4 Stars for the product.\n",
      "What the heck do I do with all my old NiMH batteries now?!? These batteries are absolutely brilliant.  They look like AA batteries, but inside each one is a 3.7V 750mAH lithium ion cell and a voltage regulator.  The voltage regulator takes the 3.7V output from the li-ion battery and steps it down to 1.5V and *keeps* it there until the internal cell drops below operating voltage spec (usually around 3.3V).  At which point, the voltage regulator drops the voltage from 1.5V to 1.1V, enough for most devices to trip the \"low battery\" indicator.As for the longevity, I can honestly say that I have no idea how long the batteries last.  I bought the set of four AA batteries with the charger and I keep that in my bag with my PowerA Wireless GameCube controller for Switch.  I play Smash Ultimate about 4 hours a day for 4-5 days a week (not competitive, I just really like the game) and rotate the batteries out each day (use batteries 1 and 2 on Day 1, batteries 3 and 4 on Day 2, 1 and 2 on Day 3,you get the idea).  I charged all four batteries to full back in February and decided to see how long they would last.I haven't charged them since.For comparison, the same amount of playtime on standard alkaline batteries is around 80ish hours (batteries that came with the controller at 1.6V gave off the low battery warning after a month and reported 1.15V on my multimeter).  The last NiMH batteries I tried in these controllers were Eneloops, but those always gave me the \"low battery\" indicator on the controller.The price is a bit steep, but considering each battery has gone through about 240 hours of gaming without a hiccup, I'd say it's well worth the money.\n"

      "Great charging set I am constantly trying to reduce my waste so I bought these so I could reuse batteries instead of just collecting the dead ones to eventually recycle one day. I got these for our Nintendo controllers for the kids instead of the disposable ones. So far, they work well, only take less than 2 hours for a full charge and can be used for quite a long time.

My older NiMH batteries will typically last about 2-3 hours in the wireless mics, whereas these lithium batteries lasted 6.5 hours before I simply gave up and turned off the mics out of boredom!!  That's WAY more time than I need for almost any conceivable recording situation, so I'm definitely a fan of these batteries!  I love the way each battery lights up blue while it's charging, the charing process happens relatively quickly, and they're quite lightweight compared to NiMH or alkaline batteries which is a nice little bonus when I'm packing around many pounds of equipment on a shoot.

      "Deceptive description of capacity, NOT! Mike J. incorrectly calculated mWh at 1.5V using cell capacity of 750mAh, \"at the rated 1.5volt output the actual capacity is 1.5v * 750mAh = 1,125mWh.\" This is wrong.He didn't convert the current like the Lithium Cell's 3.7V voltage is converted to 1.5V. This is a 2.467 reduction ratio and the current will see same ratio but as an enlargement. Remember, Power In = Power Out. (almost, as there is a small inefficiency in the conversion process).So, 1.5 * (2.467*750mAh) = 2775mWh. Just like the manufacturer stated. In reality, due to inefficiency probably closer to 2500mWh.Another way to look at this is, if a product draws 1A at 1.5V, this is only 405mA being drawn off the Lithium Cell at this time using 2.467 ratio with an ideal converter. However, If the \"real\" buck converter is 90% efficient (reasonable number to use) then actual current off the battery is slightly higher at 450mA.\n",

I used to use some rechargeable batteries from Fujitsu and they would last only about 2 weeks. After switching to these from TENAVOLTS,  the batteries would last 3+ months before needing a charge. Definitely recommend if you can get this on sale. It's worth paying a little extra when compared to non-rechargeable batteries since these are better for the environment; less waste etc.\n",

This makes them a great choice for things like motorized toys.However, the capacity isn't very high. They don't go as long as a regular non-rechargable battery would go and they definetly don't go as long as normal lithium batteries. But they charge quickly so it is not a big issue. I have charged an earlier set for up to 50 times now without any issues.\n",

I also use them with my spinbrush toothbrush and MAN that's the fastest I ever heard that brush spin! Most of whatever negative reviews you read about these batteries are probably due to not discharging the batteries FIRST before charging them. These don't come with the charger, however they do offer it.They come with enough power to use upon arrival and it will deliver peak power until the bms (battery management system) in each battery turns it off.  These batteries are definitely worth the buy, I used to buy the Energizer and Duracell rechargeables but the power doesn't last and they horribly fade and quickly.  These batteries are your solution, and NO I'M NOT PAID TO WRITE THIS AND I PAID FOR THEM WITH MY OWN MONEY!

      "Killed my Blink XT Cameras Bought a set of these to use in Blink XT cameras.  Maybe bad batch or bad luck but the batteries worked fine at first but then the cameras I used them in both died.  Wild speculation: I suspect the circuitry that regulates the voltage down to 1.5V is not reliable and it has a voltage spike up to 3.7v as it dies out and fries the camera.  Blink customer support replaced the cameras under warranty and told me not to use these batteries.  I'd recommend checking out EBL 1.5V Lithium Rechargeable instead which have a higher mAh rating iirc.\n",

      "2 or 3 recharges before totally dead I bought 2 packs of these in 2019 and have recharged each battery a small hand-full of times since then. I was expecting performance at least somewhat similar to the rechargable Energizer batteries I've had for a good 10 years now. Unfortunately, the majority of these batteries no longer hold a charge and will no longer recharge. This is in stark contrast to the Energizer, Amazon, and Sorbo brand batteries that are still running just fine. I will definitely not be buying this brand again.\n",
      "Product works as described! Would highly recommend this seller and product! Product works as described! Would highly recommend this seller and product!\n",
      "Batteries hold a lot of charge I like that the batteries seem to hold a lot of charge. I charged them to full once I received them a few weeks ago and I still haven’t had to recharge them. The included charger can be used for other rechargeable batteries too if you have any. There are LED indicators on the top that easily let you know when they’re done.\n",
      "Lasts forever! These are amazing! They work until they are dead. I use them for VR gaming remotes and I never lose tracking with these because they hold their power the entire time until they are dead and then I can immediately grab the extra 2. It’s perfect if you want 100% charge the entire life of the battery. I played hours and days before they fully died. The charge is quick and comes in a nice compact case for charging and storing. They have a blue LED light that lets you know when they are charging and turns off when fully charged. I will be switching to lithium batteries for all our remotes!\n",
      "For the price,I wish they came with more batteries We bought these for our kid’s toys 🧸They have longevity if you charge them correctly.They are a bit pricey so I only wish they were a bit more affordable OR that they came with more batteries 🔋\n",
      "Don't waste your money, these are Junk!. I have 2 sets of these battery's, I bought with a promotion about half price.  In my opinion they not good for anything except low power draw products. It states they're no good for camera flash as they DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH POWER.  The fact that they stay at 1.5 until they are dead is great!.  If they had enough power to run anything. Like maybe a remote control car, or similar. Nicad batterys have 3 times the power (amperage).  I would not buy again, not even at half price.  Don't waste your money.  Jeff.\n",
      "Great value! Love these batteries best bang for your buck!\n",
      "AA batteries and charger These batteries have excellent capacity and charge very quickly. I would call these top of the line rechargeable batteries so they’re worth a higher cost. They work well on power hungry electronics like RC cars.\n",
      "Must buy who have kids with lots of battery toys Good quality and more of value saving if you kids home and whose toys need the charging one or another weekI am really happy with the product as it was recommended  by my friend\n",
      "Much better than older ones So far so good. Bought them for my oculus controllers.They seem to last.Nothing worse than having your batteries die while playing Beat Saber!\n",
      "DOA Had them unused, went to use them but they were dead. Put them in the charger which doesn’t recognize them, so I can only assume them have bad cells. Would not buy again.\n",
      "The Lightest Rechargeable batteries Money Can Buy! I am using these in my G305 with a AA adapter and they're working great, due to them being much lighter than regular rechargeable batteries, the mouse feels great in my hands. I am also looking to get the AA version for my gaming controllers due to their weight and rechargeability. These are definitely a little on the pricier side but they're definitely worth it due to the lack of rechargeable Lithium batteries and the quality to go with them.\n",
      "Perfect for VR controllers These are the batteries you want for your VR controllers.  They provide a steady 1.5V the entire time which helps immensely with tracking.Included charger is basic, but it works.  Haven't timed charging times, but it's quick enough.Not oversized like some brands.  Fit every device that uses a standard AA battery without scraping on anything or damaging the wrap.\n",
      "Feel the POWER! I bought these for my Windows Mixed Reality controllers. Normal rechargeable batteries are only 1.2 volts and it was causing some weird problems. After some digging I found these and the controls works great now. The batteries last quite a while. I dont play as much right now because its summer and I'm not snowed in. Haha.I would recommend these to anyone based on my experience. if you have something like vr controls that need 1.5 volts and you want rechargeable batteries lithium ion is the way to go for sure.\n",
      "2775mwh, not 2775mah, actually 1850mAh cheating on the mah\n",
      "Value for money My kid is 6 month old and we need lots of batteries in lots of toy. That’s why I stuck with this rechargeable batteries. This batteries work so far.so if you have kids .. this is must have thing\n",
      "I just had to say something. I am a new VR enthusiast and wanted a good battery to use for my controllers.  After using copper tops and Amazon basics rechargeables that would never last for more than a session or not show a full charge in Steam or WMR, I bit the bullet and paid the hefty sum for 2 sets of these.  After a week and a half and easy 20 hours of gaming I'm still over half battery!  If I get the means I will get the wall 20 battery unit to free up some usb ports.  Very impressed!\n",
      "Work great in cameras Great savings over non rechargables. Great for camerasWish they had an 8 pack though.Next jump above 4 pack is 20. Too expensive.\n",
      "Only thing that works in my blood pressure monitor Tried using regular AAA alkaline batteries but they die too quick.Tried using 'normal' NiMH rechargeable batteries but the voltage was too lowThese are the only rechargeable batteries I could find that work and also hold a decent charge for more than just a few uses.Expensive though.\n",
      "Charger works, lithium batteries last longer Want to be able to reuse batteries in Garmin E-trex.  These fit the bill and with the charger I can charge one set and use the other.\n",
      "It will fail in days These batteries stopped outputting the advertised power after 14 days of full charge and use. One of them will not charge anymore. Junk.\n",
      "awesome lithium rechargables I purchased the aa and aaa they were reccomended to me and i love them but they are a bit pricey but well worth the investment for my uses.\n",
      "it's a rechargeable battery set. I bought this for a gift for my daughter. She hasn't used it yet. I have no idea about its usability or value.\n",
      "It’s good enough. If you are using this to power your hand control for VR like oculus or what have you... it lasts long but it tweaks the controller to move and spin on its own more vs a regular good battery. Only thing I can say.\n",
      "Saw the YouTube teardown vids... Happy to see that someone is making fully enclosed rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries. these are fairly durable, it seems you have to cut into them to get to the circuitry which is all sealed unlike the ones with individual USB ports.They're true to their word on capacity to an extent, the mAh rating on the battery is actually the capacity of the 3.7v cell inside the casing. After 3.7v DC > 1.5v DC conversion the mAh rating on the AAs is actually closer to ~2450 mAh.Some nice to haves are the constant 1.5v output, makes laser pointers shine bright up until the battery depletes. I no longer feel guilty expending a ton of AAAs for the sake of my cats entertainment. Also you don't have to worry about getting them wet since they're sealed. I wouldn't take them diving though...\n",
      "Perfectly suitable for 1.5v alkaline Came complete drained, all 4 fully charged in less than 2 hours, each batter tested between 1.53 - 1.56 volts DC. Used them in a wireless lavelier microphone, charge lasted about 20 hours, it was wiping out alkaline Energizer batteries in about 6 hours, deffinelty paid for itself, and definitely works, would recommend to everyone.\n",
      "Outdoor camera use Update:I purchased these for an outdoor camera. Previously I was using lithium batteries that didn’t recharge and they were lasting just shy of the two month mark. I charged these overnight and they have only lasted 16 days. Not impressed.So far so good. Purchased to put in an outdoor camera. Regular lithium batteries that are not rechargeable lasted 2 months. Excited to see how these hold up. Will update if batteries are less then stellar!\n",
      "Is this better that N these are nice rechargeable batteries but the don't seem to keep their charge for long.  I put them in my cordless mouse and have to recharge them every 2 weeks.\n",
      "2 of 8 batteries were eventually duds Two of my eight AA batteries stopped charging or holding a charge after 8 months or so.\n",
      "Don't waste your money, these are useless. I bought these batteries to use in my august door lock. The door lock need 1.5 V batteries and standard re-chargeable batteries only provide 1.2V. After charging they lasted 24 hours before I got a critically low battery warning. Soon after they we're completely dead.\n",
      "No charger was included. I found it irritating that this did not include the charger! It appeared that the charger was included. I had to order again after searching to find a package that includes a charger and the price was the same. I feel I was ripped off.\n",
      "Does its job Sale price made it worthwhile to test.  First installed on an alarm siren.  Batteries do not last as long as alkaline AA but these will have a much longer life.  If you purchase these for something similar to my alarm siren, you will need time to measure voltage, does not drop like an alkaline, and check for operation to determine recharge cycle times. Then expect to set up a calendar reminder.  Keep in mind the battery will hold voltage until it is almost ready to croke.  This makes it best suited for applications where failure, discharge, is acceptable.  My siren application is acceptable because I have 6 sirens so a temporary down of one siren is acceptable.\n",
      "No issues Came as promised. Seem to work well. Going to take a while to see how the hold up naturally.\n",
      "The best rechargeable Li-ion AA batteries available. I own lots of rechargeable AAs, but these batteries are much higher quality than the other brands. The charger is simple to use, batteries charge quickly, the output is 1.5v stable, the declared mAh is accurate, and these batteries are tough and durable. Highly recommended!\n",
      "short life I bought more than 10 packs of these thinking they were supposed to be long-lasting.  But I was wrong.  I put 2 of these in my flashlight and they only lasted about 2 minutes after a fresh charge.  At first, I thought it was a few dead batteries, then I had 40 to play with and they all lasted 2 minutes and the flashlight just die.  So now I'm using them for TV remotes only so they can last a month.  Regular batteries would last 2 years on my TV remote. Regretfully, I bought so many packs.  I was so pissed off I trashed half of them.\n",
      "Recomended Great..will get more batteries of this kind.\n",
      "Dissatisfied I purchased the four pack with charger back in October, already two of the four are no longer holding a charge?????\n",
      "Beware: Batteries don't last long! Several charges later ... 2 out of 4 batteries dead ! :(Not Happy with the purchase ... and buying 4 rechargeable batteries is like over $30 ... I could use the money and buy 24 AA Ultimate Lithium batteries!!!\n",
      "These are less than half of the performance of name brand Lithium batteries So far from my testing (i have the $200 20 battery and wall charger) these batteries last less than half (actually nearly 3 times less) than energizer ultimate lithium batteries.  I performed equal tests in two different flashlights.  brand new energizers and these were fully charged.  started them up at the same time.  the energizers were still going over 2.5 hours and these batteries failed and lost charge at just over an hour in the same devices.i guess the good thing about these batteries are the number of times you can charge them and how quickly they charge (less than 2 hours) but I wouldn't buy these again simply because for a lithium battery they simply are not nearly the quality of a duracell or energizer lithium battery.....not even close folks so don't get your hopes up when you see these.\n",
      "its what i need 1.5 v batterys now i need AAA 1.5 v battery's  i do not want 1.2 v battery's, that's Y i like TENAVOLTS ALL 1.5 V\n",
      "SO much cheaper than eating up disposable batteries These came highly recommended and for good reason. Easy to use, and they last longer than disposable AAs. They are 100% worth the money. Highly recommend them for anyone with an Oculus Quest.\n",
      "best battery ever super loooooooooooooooooooooooooong life battery! for my camera battery grip, no worries about my any trips!\n",
      "Great product Used for a year, no problem. Sit for months and it still has full power, very impressive\n",
      "All looks good out of the box! I just received these batteries with charger. I do not have a DVOM or battery checking device other than my personal GPS for which they are intended.  So far after 1.5 hrs of continuous use the battery meter icon indicates full charge. I would normally see around 1/3% used. So things are looking extremely positive. Thank you\n",
      "Just buy them they are great. Had them for a year now. Great quality. Feels high quality and the batteries have a long life but charge quick. I mostly use them for gaming on my Xbox and they are perfect for that. I can usually go 16 hours while gaming before I have to swap them out. Highly recommended,\n",
      "These are the good ones. Done a lot of research and used them for a while. These are the good lithiums out there in terms of quality, build, and duration. Please do not sell yourselves short TENAVOLTS. Keep up the good quality!! :)\n",
      "One battery died after 1st charge. Brought them couple of months ago, used it for once. now one battery died and shows 0 V after charge. I end up with 3 batteries. Most stuff need 4. :(\n",
      "Lithium batteries at decent price Charger and betteries work as advertised thus far...\n",
      "GREAT! great value and they work as advertised\n",
      "Nice I am so glad I bought these. Saves a lot of money.\n",
      "they need to be recharged too often, but so far still work. Expensive.  Limited to their own charger.  Each charge doesn't last very long, but they do work.\n",
      "Perfect for WIndows Mixed Reality Controllers I purchased these because the amazonbasics 1.2V rechargeable batteries were always read as low in my controllers. They would even turn off by themselves despite being fully charged.With the TENAVOLTS, the batteries are almost perfect. good for hours, no performance issues. Only downside is the controller will always think the battery is full, but the batteries last for so long that it's never an issue. In the 6 months that I owned these, I only recharged them about 1-2 times per month, and I've never had the batteries run out on me (I play 5-10 hours of VR per week). Get these and never worry about dealing with low batteries again.\n",
      "After 6 months only half the run time When I first bought these the runtime was great.  They'd last a week in many devices.  Keyboards and mice would be about a month.But not anymore.  I get about 2 days now.\n",
      "Great product with a good lasting charge. These were a little pricy but I wanted to get ones that would last! These last a week and I use my oculus headset a ton so it’s impressive they last that long. The other two batteries charge while I’m using the first two. Great product!\n",
      "Best Rechargeable Batteries Made I have been using both the AA version and now the AAA version of these batteries for over a year and they constantly amaze me with how long they last without needing to be recharged and how great they are at holding a true 1.5 volts all the way to the end before needing to be recharged.  I know that the upfront cost is a bit high but if you use some batteries regularly, these batteries will pay for themselves many times over and you are helping the environment in the process.\n",
      "Works great for smart lock With regular AA batteries, our Schlage lock only seemed to last about a month before I got notified that the battery was low. I replaced them with these rechargeable and they seem to last 2-3 months. The first set straight from Amazon lasted about 2-months. The 2nd set, seems to last much longer (maybe 4-5 months?). Since the first set worked pretty well, I ordered a second set to rotate them.  I got them for $12 for 4, will definitely order them again when they go on sale again!\n",
      "They charge quickly - and discharge even faster. A few days after ensuring they were fully charged, I used then in a (metal) flash-light.  Nice and bright; better than NiMH.However, it became a race between the flashlight becoming too hot to hold and the batteries dying.Keep the light on, and the flashlight was too hot to hold within 15 minutes.Turn the light off for a minute every few minutes and you can can hang on to the light but the batteries die within the hour.  Guess they're not meant to be space-heaters. ;-).  Some of my old NiMH batteries STILL last longer.Back to searching for more recent technology LiOn batteries.\n",
      "Buyer beware!! The warranty period for this product is ONLY 6 months, which is way too short than other brands.\n",
      "Failure rate of 16% I enjoy having a Lithium Ion rechargeable, but my experience so far is two of the 12 batteries I purchased will not charge.  The charging indicator on the battery is a nice feature.  I may have just over 10 charging cycles on the batteries in the last 5 months.\n",
      "Worth it Works well in my blink cameras\n",
      "Very Disappointed Way too expensive for what you get. I was expecting lithium batteries to last a lot longer and give more power than regular rechargeables. I was wrong. I wanted to use these in my LED flashlight but they kept dying within a few minutes of use. Worse than my old rechargeables. Very disappointed!\n",
      "Potential replacement for devices that do not do well on 1.2 volt rechargeable metal hydrides. Tested with a serious professional electrician digital vom that is suppose to be super accurate.  The voltage on all four batteries came in an 1.53 volts.  Very nice.  Now will check on device after several weeks to see how this figure remains.  Zinc carbon and alkaline batteries start high, typically 1.6 volts, and slowly reduce in voltage.  The lithium ion rechargeables are suppose to maintain a long life at the 1.5 volt level.  Will periodically check on device to see if this in fact true. This review may possibly be updated if the performance of these batteries do not meet the seller's claims.\n",
      "Good batteries. Using these for my Blink outdoor cameras and they work great so far. Kind of expensive compared to other rechargeables.\n",
      "No Charge Never worked, and never charged. Worthless.\n",
      "recharger repurchase hi.my son accidentally throw his charger away is there a way for me to repurchase one?kids are hm from school being. closed\n",
      "Longevity Longevity\n",
      "YES, there is an indicator when the batteries are fully charged. I had read some comments that some users couldn’t tell when the batteries were fully charged. It would really help to read the short but very helpful instructions that come with the product as you can see in the picture I took. The green light always stays on when the charger is plugged in, and there is a blue light at the bottom of each battery while it is charging as you can see in the other picture I took. The blue light turns off when each respective battery is fully charged. The batteries and charger work exactly like they’re supposed to, and the batteries last a LONG time on a full charge. Also, make sure you only use a 5V charger (iPhone small brick charger) or computer USB port which is also in the instructions.\n",
      "Maintains an honest 1.5v per cell I have a Sangean shortwave radio that is fussy -- it works well on 4x 1.5 Alkaline batteries at 6v, but the RF performance drops considerably with the 4.8 volts that standard 4x 1.2 rechargables feature.  The extra 1.2 volts makes a huge difference in reception, and these cells are perfect for that. I haven't had them long enough to see if they provide an honest 2775 mWh...but I am liking them so far, a lot!\n",
      "One battery dead after a few months Had for a couple of months charges it three timesOne battery already dead\n",
      "Great Works great! Use it on my quest controllers\n",
      "No es recomendable Pésimo producto, no tiene el rendimiento de unas pilas de litio, duran menos que mis pilas de ni-NH, lo uso en una linterna de cabeza black diamondNo puedo poner menos de 1 estrella por que me gustaría poner 0\n",
      "Fancy light indictor while charging but does not last. Read my review before purchase. I purchased these batteries based on the 4+ stars review. I am using them in my Apple Wireless keyboard.A fully charged battery does not last more than one month. The Apple keyboard does not draw that much power and but I need to recharge them frequently. The recharge time for my \"depleted batteries\" is quick, about 30 minutes.\n",
      "Nicely designed product - works great! Bought these to try in my remotes (Roku, TV etc.), because the 1.2 V AAA Ni-MH rechargeables never lasted long before needing a recharge. Has been almost a month since I started using them, and they are yet to need a recharge.\n",
      "Works great in WMR/VR controllers These batteries last roughly twice as long (~14 hours) as non-rechargeable alkaline batteries in my Windows Mixed Reality / Virtual Reality headset controllers, and don't suffer from the low-voltage issues related to NiMH rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "GREAT IDEA PURCHASED IT FOR MY BLINK CAMERAS AND IT'S A GREAT AND INEXPENSIVE IDEA FOR WHEN YOUR ORIGINAL BATTERIES RUN OUT OF JUICE, YOU CAN REPLACE THEM WITH THIS RECHARGEABLE ONES AND KEEP RE-CHARGING THEM., FOR LESS MONEY THAN BUYING DISPOSABLE ONE, A LIFESAVER!\n",
      "Great rechargeable for constant output. Did my research for what battery to use for a certain wifi camera brand and this was what I needed. Could have easily went for non- rechargeable, but I like less waste. Seems to be working well. The battery seems to still hold charge really well. Will update after a few months.\n",
      "Way better than NIMH Supplies 1.5 volts just like alkaline but the voltage doesn't drop.  Ni-Mh only provides 1.2v so they don't work as well for some applications.\n",
      "Good Works good battery doesnt last long.\n",
      "Good buy really. They seem to work grate. First time I can use a lithium-ion battery in normal things, without having to change the thing I am putting them in to.\n",
      "so far so good.  worked where expected to. used it for 2 months so far.  so far, so good.  don't have any hard data to draw from about durability and capacity, but it's worked for all the devices that didn't work well with the NiMH rechargeables.DC-circuit controlled li-ion rechargable AA's is the path forward for disposable replacements going forward.  will report back if any of the 8 cells fail between now and next year.\n",
      "Worth the upfront cost! We use these batteries in some wireless mics at church. They get left on for hours at a time and last a few weeks, then we just recharge them. They’ve more than paid for themselves in a few months.\n",
      "Battery Temperature over 103 F Be very careful with these.  If they work, they are good, but out of 4 batteries, 1 completely died, 2 reached 103F (Verified with a thermometer) during normal use, and the 4th is ok.\n",
      "Deceptive description of capacity The TENAVOLTS Rechargeable 1.5v Lithium 2775 mWh AA batteries are actually 3.7v LI-ion batteries in a AA housing with internal voltage converter to reduce 3.7v battery to 1.5v output. The package received states rating as 2775mWh,  750mAh, 1.5volts.  The deception is in claiming 2775 mWh at 1.5v.  Nowhere in the Amazon description does it state the battery mAh capacity as only 750mAh.  Lithium 3.7v battery will have stated mWh rating;  3.7v * 750mAh = 2,775mWh.  However at the rated 1.5volt output the actual capacity is 1.5v * 750mAh = 1,125mWh.  If intended use is a camera flash or other device with high current draw, stick with name brand Ni-MH.\n",
      "Great buy These have saved us many batteries.  When the temperatures drop, batteries are suck dry of energy.  Having these rechargeable batteries has saved us money and saved disposing of dead batteries.\n",
      "Perfect for Game controller. Brought this batteries for only 1 purpose :  Xbox One Controller!  These batteries last long time.  The only downside is charge too long.  I think at least 6 hrs for full charge, but hey as long as last is great for me.\n",
      "Good Good\n",
      "Good battery Came fully charged. Still working, have not needed to charge yet.\n",
      "Easy to use Great to have around\n",
      "Good batteries Really nice batteries, super happy I bought them. Works well with my gb boy and everdrive.\n",
      "Does NOT include charger! Description says charger is included but there is NO charger included...I even ordered a replacement thinking the charger had inadvertently been left out but the 2nd order was the same, just a box of batteries In a plastic container. Even the packaging of the item says to only use the included charger for charging! Why would I pay $30 for batteries I can’t charge? No one would, rip off!\n",
      "Rechargeable Lithium battery's Didn't know what to expect with these, but they are very good last long\n",
      "Long lasting Money saver. I use them for baby toys and they last a few days\n",
      "Unbeatable - Get These! These are hands-down the best battery you will ever purchase! I use them primarily in my Garrett AT Max metal detector and they outlast every other traditional battery I have tried (including non rechargeable energizer etc). I’ve also noticed a performance boost because these run continuously at 1.5 V until dead rather than dropping slowly as you use the device.One thing you should know however is that your device will not notify you when the battery is nearly dead because it will still receive the full 1.5V. It will simply shut off when the battery is exhausted and ready to recharge.\n",
      "Great for Oculus Quest Controllers These (with 5 of the tiny elastic bands for braces on them, to keep them from sliding around) work fantastic for the Oculus Quest controller to fix tracking issues in Beat Saber. I wish they lasted longer, but they work perfect right to the end. And they're lighter than a normal AA, which also helps keep them from sliding around in the controller. When you swing down fast the centripetal force can be enough to compress the spring in the controller and make the positive end of the controller lose contact enough to mess with tracking for a split second. Very annoying. These fix that.\n",
      "Truly put out full power until they need recharging I have used rechargeable batteries for about ten years now.  After four months of using Tenavolts, they have proven to lasted just as longs as my other rechargeable batteries, but they really do put out full power until they are dead and need to recharged.  With every rechargeable battery i have used up until now, after just two or three days in an electric toothbrush would run noticeable slower, but fast enough.  The Tenavolts ran as if they were just charged and showed no slowing down for over three months.\n",
      "Great! Works great! Charges quickly.\n",
      "Disappointed Expected these rechargeable Lithium to be at least as good as regular alkaline batteries. Used AA size for a Neeweer Speedlite flash and AAA for a small LED flashlight. For both applications the Tenavolts discharged very fast. Compared with regular batteries: 31 flashes - Tenavolt, 318 flashes - Brand A, 409 flashes - Brand B.In the LED lamp Tenavolts lasted 1:54 h versus 5:40 h Brand A at full brightness. Note that the Tenavolts shut off when discharged and the Brand A alkaline continued working after 5:40 h for many hours more at reduced brightness.\n",
      "Good Value Great product 👌. Use in remotes an item we all need batteries for. Highly recommend if you can swing the $$.Nice to have batteries and have to buy some all the time.\n",
      "Great for 15 minutes then they shut off completely ! I bought two identical LED dive flashlights. I loaded one flashlight with ray-o-vac alkaline batteries, and the other with tenavolts batteries - fully charged.Woke up the next morning and the ray o vac flashlight was still lit , but the Tenavolt flashlight was completely dead.Disappointed, I installed the two remaining fully charged batteries back in the flashlight to see exactly how long these batteries will  last. After 15 minutes, the batteries were very HOT to touch, but not hot enough to burn my hand.After 16 minutes. the flashlight completely shut off. It did not go dim, it just completely shut off. Convinced that the plastic flashlights were causing the batteries to overheat - I re-charged the batteries, put them back in the flashlight,turned it on, and placed it in the freezer - on top of an ice tray. Fortunately, the fan in the freezer had just turned on, causing the freezer to act like a convection freezer. (even colder than Buffalo in a blizzard at night).I checked back in 16 minutes and the light was still on - 17 still on,  19 still on, 20 still on, at 22 minutes it was dead.The LED was ice cold and the batteries were only warm. So it turns out the batteries were not overheating and shutting off as a result- it appears this is all the energy they have ! 16 minutes in a LED flashlight - unless you live in Buffalo, and want to trek thru a blizzard at night, then you have 20 minutes till blackout.VERY DIsappointing!\n",
      "Not worth it. Bought for a headlamp. They last about 2.5 hrs from full charge. Then light will start to flicker.  Not really worth the money. The other brand from hardware store works better.\n",
      "Maybe a got a bad pair Are you supposed to put this on a regular  battery charger?Because I did and they got so hot I thought that was going to burn out and cause a fire🔥\n",
      "Buyer Beware Bought two complete sets.  That’s eight batteries.  Of those eight, three went dead after several recharge cycles.  Unsatisfactory outcome.  Also be aware that the advertised figure of 2775 mWh is NOT the standard used in the industry.  It’s only when when you read the back of the package that you get the honest comparison of only 750 mAh.  Misleading advertising.  Buyer Beware.\n",
      "Will not power Nest Smoke Detectors The main reason I bought these rechargeable lithium batteries was to save money over the long run using in my 4 Nest battery-powered smoke detectors around my house. The Nest Detect takes 6 lithium Energizer batteries about every 6 months and they are pricey. I tried the Tenavolts batteries and after a few hours, the Nest Detect starting chirping for low battery even though the batteries were fully charged. I believe the Tenevolts don't have a high enough mAh capacity to power the smoke detector. It's a shame they do not work for my intended purpose, but the batteries do work well in other devices, toys, etc.\n",
      "Good battery, alright battery life So far so good , wish the batteries could hold more juice since it seems to last way less then Energizer lithium\n",
      "Longest lasting batteries I have ever seen. Period Awsome. I use this for my smart door lock. I used all expensive brands and the maximum last for around 40 days and I had to replace them. I have these batteries for over 2 months and only 10% is used. I can't believe that.\n",

      "So far so good I purchased these for use in wireless microphone transmitters. I can get about 8 hours from 2 batteries per charge. That's plenty for any show I do.  Disadvantages is, the battery indicator on the microphones is always 3 out of 3 bars. The indicator does not indicate capacity remaining, only voltage.  I wish they made an 8 bay charger, or something more than the 4 bay and less than the 20 bay.8/11/20Follow up.I now have 2 of these chargers and 16 AA batteries. I use them for karaoke mics. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to use them every day since Covid to really test their durability/cycling tolerance.I'm using them in VocoPro 5800 mics. I can leave the mics on for a 4 hour show with no issues. I've left them on for a 7 hour show with no issues.They charge pretty quickly. I've never had to wait more than about 90 minutes for 4 batteries to charge. I have both chargers plugged into a 7 port powered USB hub. The chargers draw about 1.25 amps per charger. The hub is capable of 30 watts which is 6 amps at 5 volts, but I'm guessing that the charger is only capable of drawing the 1.25 amps, which is half of 2.4 amps, which is what a normal phone charger delivers to a phone. It's probably because it's charging at a lower voltage. Perhaps 1.5 volts x 1.25 amps which is just a little less than 2 watts (1.875 watts).One thing I've found is that if the batteries sit for any length of time (say, over 2 weeks) and you try to use them, they don't hold their charge. I used 2 week old batteries in a couple mics recently and they squealed out and died less than an hour into the event.When fully charged, though, with these mics, they last a good long time. At least 7 hours as stated above.2 minuses:1. Using with mics with battery indicators is, the battery indicators work off voltage. When the voltage decreases, the battery indicator is supposed to glow. With these batteries maintaining a constant 1.5 volts, there is no indication that the batteries are dying. They just quit. Once they dip below 1.5 volts, they just shut off.2. They're expensive.\n",
      "Good rechargeable lithium ion battery Very good product overall.I use it for blink security cameras which require lithium ion battery. So far no issue with cold 20F. Will see if it works for hot in summer.\n",

      "They seem to work as well as the Kentli ones I use these in a ATN scope and they seem to last just as long as the Kentli batteries as a cheaper price.  I don' know about longevity as i have only had them a short while.  I also don't know what the remote control question is about.\n",
      "Works Great In My VR Controllers! This is one of the only battery types out there that works in my VR controllers (O+) and lasts and lasts and lasts. The only negative to that is that you don't get a depleting battery gauge, it just goes until it dies. But I believe that's because these squeeze out every last drop of power until the safety/protection kicks in.Thankfully they charge pretty fast (depending on what USB charger you plug them into). I had a full charge again in less than 2 hours. Oddly enough, the batteries themselves have a blue light on the bottom indicating charge status. While in the charger Blue on = charging; Blue off = done.The negatives I came across are:1. You can't charge these on anything but the included charger. I tried charging in an expensive battery charger and it will either charge these for a while then just stop, or it doesn't even start charging them. I noticed rapid flickering of the blue lights on the batteries when my charger showed 99% then some stopped but others kept charging for a while. (I'm not sure if they were being charged at all because when I put them into their own charger they went for a while and stopped charging, this could be because their charger is timed and not a smart charger though, I never tested their voltage to see for sure but maybe one day I will...) The ones that stopped charging on my charger won't charge on it again.. It just doesn't \"see\" them at all anymore, they still seem to charge fine on their own charger though. But it makes me wary that the batteries may be damaged now.2. Cost. These are pretty expensive for a 4 pack of AA batteries. And I'm not sure if they'll last long enough to break even vs Alkaline or vs NiMH because some of what I've read about them isn't great on the durability front.3. No included power adapter. The back of the charger says to use a power source that is 5 volts and up to 2.4 Amps input. The manual says don't go over 5v input as it may damage the charger. Otherwise ymmv as to how long your charge takes.Otherwise that's it, they just work and none of the claims I've read from them have been misleading.\n",

      "Good batteries, great customer service Needed some rechargeable 1.5V batteries so my Nimh batteries wouldn't work. Some devices like our VR controllers need 1.5V. We also have some other devices that don't work well with the Nimh batteries lower voltage like my GPS and digital camera accessories. Searched around Amazon and these popped up. I wasn't sure about the USB charging so didn't buy them right away but then they came up on sale so bought a set.  Seemed to work fine, not as fast charging as my Nimh Enerloops but I like the 1.5V. Well after about 6 months, I noticed I was not getting any lights on the charger so contacted the seller and they asked about my problem and once I told them what I was seeing, they offered to send a replacement. I thought I would get a charger but they sent a new kit. They are charging now and seem to be fine. I'd like to thank the seller for such a hassle free service. I think the vendors on Amazon provide better service because Amazon holds them to a higher standard. I can't say that for Wal..... vendors, I won't buy from any of their vendors anymore since they don't back the customers.\n",
      "An AA sized regulated 1.5 volt power supply. If your device is well designed, it will work normally as your alkaline or NiMH battery gradually decreases in voltage.  The Tenavolts are for those devices that are very fussy about the voltage.  The batteries are expensive, but they perform exactly as advertised, and deliver an extremely constant 1.5 volts.  And they can handle high current spikes easily.  I use them in motorized Nerf blasters which are famous for eating batteries.One last thing, \"Nanfu Direct\".  I'd never heard of the company, so I didn't know what to expect.  Well, one of the 12 Tenavolts batteries I got proved defective.  It took a few weeks to find this out.  I emailed Nanfu through Amazon's link, explained what happened, and asked if they could replace the bad one.  I got the \"thank you, please allow 1-2 days for a response\" message.Instead of 1-2 days, they responded within hours, apologized for the problem and immediately sent a replacement.  I'm impressed.\n",
      "Decent quality Not holding battery too long\n",
      "Perfect for game controllers I use these for Xbox One game controllers while gaming on PC. Unbelievable performance - they last FAR longer than other (typically NiMh) batteries between charges, and are MUCH lighter. I appreciate the weight savings more than anything; my controller feels flyweight in comparison to standard batteries. Another great benefit is that these seem to be current regulated, meaning they supply the same amount of power to the device regardless of charge level, until they are almost depleted. Charging is fast, I only wish I didn't have to use their specific charger (they are designed to be used ONLY with the included charger). Price is quite high but I got mine on sale and I'm super happy.\n",

I'm using them to power an outdoor led light string and so far they have worked 16 hours / day for 5 days without needing to be recharged. The NiCd ones they replaced lasted two days tops before they needed to be recharged.  The extra capacity plus they work at 1.5 volts instead of 1.25V is I think very much a part of why they work so well.\n",

The regular NiMH or NiCad batteries don't charge to a full 1.5v and wear down fast, so the lock always gives an error about the batteries needing to be changed, even when they're brand new. These lithium batteries deliver 1.5v until they're dead, so I get no errors and the lock works at full power.The only downside is that since they don't drop below a certain voltage, I don't get low battery warnings.

I play many hours of video games each day and I am able to get a solid week out of a charge. I got these on sale for about $12... and for that price, the value is killer. They are currently priced at $35 which at first sounds a bit high, but now knowing that the battery life is as long as it is, I think it's totally worth it!One con: when they die, they die. There is no indication that they are close to dying - the Xbox shows full battery all the way up until the controller shuts off and won’t turn back on... kinda sucks mid-game, but I’ve learned to just charge them after a few uses.\n",

      "These are some pretty cool batteries, if you like rechargable batteries try them out! These batteries are pretty cool. I used them for a couple months and they last a good while. They do charge very quickly. I was surprised when they were done charging so fast.Time will only tell how long these batteries will last as far as longevity goes (in years) but I got them for an incredibly low price so I couldn't resist trying them out.The big thing here is these will hold a voltage around 1.5v for the entire use of the battery. This means the voltage will drop off quickly when the batteries are at the end of charge, so your devices will just die on you when the batteries die. This also means you likely won't face low battery messages or any other kind of annoyance until the battery is fully dead and your device shuts off. I use nimh batteries and those, they seem to flash a low battery warning on just about everything for the entire use of the product. Its also impossible to get them fully discharged which results in poor performance over time, however most people say these kind of batteries don't have memory effect but they seem to last less and less each time I use them. The only way to get a nimh battery to full discharge is to put them in a charger that discharges the battery, I have that charger and I have done that many times, and most of the time I take the batteries out they still have quite a bit of power left in them even though my device reports they are dead batteries that need recharging. These batteries don't do that, they will fully drain and your device will shut off when the batteries need to be changed or recharged.  These batteries would be especially ideal for the Xbox 360 controller which flashes a very bright, annoying dancing light when the batteries are low.You can't put these batteries into camera flashes, the product manual says so, so those who want to use them for that will be out of luck.I did put these batteries in a AA battery digital camera and they worked just fine and lasted a long time. I used the flash too.You also have to use the charger that is provided, I haven't had a problem with it, but you won't be able to use your other fancy chargers.You can charge these with any USB charger, it doesn't come with a USB charger so you will have to provide one, however this is very handy as you don't have to have a separate charger plugged in for these batteries.\n",

      "Nice one I like this product\n",
      "Nice constant voltage, but abrupt drop-off  :) All too many devices need AA cells, not many take 14500s (4.2V out of the charger), and some don't like NiMH cells (constant 1.2V), so these fill the niche in providing a constant 1.5V from fresh out of the charger 'til they abruptly drop dead.  And I despise alkaleaks, as those hateful little things will leak their corrosive innards in your flashlight, remote control, wireless mouse, whatever you have them in, and ruin the device.  So trying these Tenavolts was a nice compromise between maintaining a fresh-alkaleak voltage from start to end, no drop-off.They charge easily in the included charger (straight 5V from the USB supply), lighting the cell's internal LED while charging, and going out when done.  That's it.While they may not work in high-drain devices like camera-flash units (not like that's plastered allllll over the description in multiple places), they do work fine in AA flashlights like my SP10 and E03.  In fact, my E03 has perfect mode-spacing when using an alkaleak, but all modes are brighter and clustered together when using a 14500, so the Tenavolt keeps that nice mode-spacing without the slightest danger of leaking inside the light itself.  And so it is for most AA-powered doodads that I tried.My only critique is that sudden drop-deadness when the internal cell is spent.  There's zero warning, no dimming or fading (slow or rapid) to forewarn that you have 5sec of light left, etc.  It's unnerving.  Still, I just keep a space cell handy Just In Case.  It's a small price to pay to be able to rest assured that you won't come back to a salt-block and ruined springs/contacts where an alkaleak used to be.Constant unwavering 1.5V from start to end, no chance of leaking and ruining the device it's in, vs a sudden death when the cell needs recharging.  Whether it's right for you depends on you.  I'm fine with the one and only drawback, and am using these in multiple goodies.\n",

These batteries are great for your items that get a lot of use such as flashlights and your other battery powered gadgets.They last a long time between charges and they charge back up in no time flat.

Maybe I got a bad batch or they just have poor quality control. I didnt use the second set until a couple weeks ago and it when I put it in my PC mouse or the kid's toys, the batteries would died every 4-7 days when they used to last 2-4 months.

Up until purchasing these, no rechargeable battery has supplied the required voltage needed to be accepted by my MiniMed-670G.

Have tested them in a digital slr camera and they did just fine. Tested in a flashlight and worked good. Put a 1 ohm load across the battery and it drew 1.1 amps for over an hour. Which was more than twice as long as a normal AA battery. Not sure why first ones didn't work. They measured 1.5 volts but very low current output. Oh well 2nd set were good.\n",
      "LONG LIFE HIGH DRAIN AA RECHARGEABLES I bought these batteries for my church to use in the wireless mikes in church, after realizing that although lithium AA's last longer than the best Alkalines... the regular Lithium AA's were still not as cost effective as these batteries.

      "Longer lasting than the NMH I was using I replaced the \"Amazon\" branded NMH I usually use in my handheld GPS with these and they seemed to outlast the other one (so far). It wasn't a perfect comparison as I might have had the screen \"on\" longer in one situation versus another but it did seem like the Lithium lasted longer (sometimes all day long). The one downside I noticed is the battery level indicator on the device does not indicate the charge remaining as it does on a NMH battery. I always carry spares as I would need to replace the NMH at least once per day, and if the batteries are older sometime more than once per day.\n",
      "Get these for devices where rechargeable AA eneloop and other non-alkaline batteries fail to work. 8 AA batteries received, with 2 chargers, nicely boxed.  Start with 5 stars.A discharge cycle at 1 amp, for all 8 batteries indicated 1100 to 1200 mAh at 1.47 to 1.50 volts, the entire discharge cycle.  So, come very much ready to put into equipment for immediate use.  Add a star for 6 stars.Recharge cycle a bit slower than claimed, with 2.5 hours or so, and full charge capacity at 1 amp discharge of 1600 to 1650 mAh.  Minus 1 star for 5 stars.  (this is because of the claimed recharge rate of 1 hr and 48 minutes and a bit below the claimed 2700 mWh.  Still a very good showing, especially for a constant 1 amp load)For those that don't want to throw away batch after batch of alkaline batteries, these serve the great fill-in purpose for those devices that don't work with NiMH or NiCd rechargeables because of the voltage disparity between alkaline and NiMH/NiCd chemistry.  As these put out a very solid 1.5 volts, if you have devices that don't quite seem to work as long as they should, or even at all, with NiMH/NiCD, then these are excellent choices.  While NiZn can also do the trick, they do go up to 1.65 volts, which may be damaging/problematic for some devices, while these should never be cause for concern, as 1.5 volts is well within the operating range (at first) for alkaline batteries.These are more costly than NiMH, so I plan on using them in devices that I used to have to make the choice between usability (high with Alkaline/low with NiMH) and cost to environment (alkaline high, NiMH low) and per usage cost (alkaline high, NiMH low).For example, my son's electric song/piano toy required that I find the best performing NiMH batteries, and even then performance would quickly degrade such that the toy would become unusable long before I would expect from high performance NiMH batteries (Eneloop pro and Amazon 2400).  Upon trying these out, the toy works perfectly, with long run life. No more swapping/charging batteries too quickly, or giving in to alkaline!Another example is a laser level I have.  When I use my best NiMH batteries (2 batteries required), the unit will detect the lower voltage as an issue, and start to flash in the pattern that indicates low battery voltage.  While it still works, it is disconcerting/unpleasant to have it continuously flash while trying to line-up any work.  With these, the laser light is rock steady, and I am no longer bothered by the flashing (or with throwing away the alkaline batteries that only last a couple of hours).If you have devices that work with NiMH/NiCd, then don't fret about these batteries.  But, if you have devices that need a little bit more oomph, then these will fit the ticket.Since they give full voltage until exhaustion, detection that works upon voltage for low battery indication will not be reliable, so do not use them if you require sufficient notice that they are about to go out.  For me, when the device stops working is fine, as I can just grab another two and swap them out quickly, with no danger.  (maybe add a beeping sound to the circuitry when the internal li-ion is at the last 10 percent or so?)Time will tell about longevity.  I have NiMH low discharge AA's that have been working 10 plus years at over 90 percent of original capacity.  If these go half that length of time, they will pay for themselves, and if they go to 10 or more years, then even more in the green!\n",
      "The best of the best!!! Works as advertised and better.\n",
      "Good battery charger So far so good\n",
      "Worked well and as described. Product was as described and has worked well with multiple uses!\n",
      "Go back to the drawing board Lasted about one week when others lasted a year. Charged and retried several times. Will be returned.\n",
      "These do not work well in high current applications, but seem ideal for many uses I bought these because I was interested in the new technology and I have, in the past, had devices that needed 1.5 V to work properly.  The firsts things I tried one of these batteries in was an inexpensive 100 lumen  AA powered  LED flash light.  I expected the light to be brighter with a 1.5 V battery  than with the, 1.2 V, NIMh AA battery I had been using, but I didn't see any difference in brightness.  Then I read reviews that complained about the batteries getting hot and not working well as NiMh in camera flash units.  That told me that these batteries have higher internal resistance than NIMh or regular 3.6 V Lithium  batteries. I'm guessing that is caused by the protection and voltage regulation circuitry in each battery.For most AA battery uses, e.g. remotes or other low powered electronic devices, this is not going to be an issue. I note, in another review, that the reviewer is happy with their performance powering his kids toy cars which is a not a low powered application, and, because of the voltage regulation, those cars maintain constant performance till a battery shuts down to protect itself.Camera flashes or high power flash that need to suck energy out of a battery as fast as as possible to quickly recharge the flash and devices that use the battery's voltage drop to sound an alarm to let the user know the batteries need to be replaced, like smoke alarms, shouldn't use this kind of battery.The simple battery charger/holder supplies charges these batteries fast when plugged into a USB power supply and the batteries that aren't being used can be left in it plugged in or not. Lithium batteries have very good low temperature performance so these batteries are good for outdoor use even in cold weather. The fact that the battery output voltage is compatible with devices designed to use non rechargeable batteries is useful as is the fact that they either deliver 1.5 volts or disconnects from the load. Personally, when travelling, I'll be carrying then, in their case/charger, with me and using my laptop to and the supplied cable to charge them as needed.\n",
      "Doesn’t last as long as I’d hope.. Got this during a deal, 4 pack with charger for $10. Even then these don’t seem to last as long as I had heard l-ion would. I use these in a little string of copper wire lights as a night light for my son. Normal rechargeable batteries lasted us two 12-hr nights. These only last two 12-hr nights too, but are brighter. The downside is when these batteries are going dead the lights begin to flash almost strobe like and frighten my son if he wakes up in the middle of the night and sees this. Definitely wouldn’t pay $35 for them now.\n",
      "Produces RF noise in my Radio When I use these batteries in my radio, I get RF noise coming from the batteries.  The circuitry  in the batteries must be producing the noise.  I have not used them in anything else, so I don't know about how they would function overall.\n",
      "proprietary charger! Gets very hot when i use them on my camera flash compared to normal batterries. also you cannot charge with any other charger\n",
      "So far so good. So far so good.  I am using this for my mouse, so it should last a long time.  People who bought these for high current applications don't know what they are doing, thus the bad reviews.I wished that they have the AAA size as well since the charger clearly can accommodate the size, but I can't find those.  The AAA ones so far are only charged by an USB cable directly.\n",
      "These batteries last a long time on a full charge. I needed a set of AA batteries for office supplies. (wireless mice and keyboards) These fit the bill perfectly. Since they stay at a constant 1.5V until dead, they are perfect for other applications too. They seem to go a long time on a single charge, I believe they last longer than other rechargeable batteries I've bought in the past, but that could be just my imagination. I bought a second set of these to use at home as well. I have a trail camera that they are in right now, and they seem to be lasting a long time in that as well.\n",
      "My Tenavolts experience Overall, these are decent batteries.  Personally, I use these to supplement my Eneloops and other NIMH batteries.The plus side of these batteries, is of course, the 1.5 volt output versus the lower NIMH battery output.  The minus is the fact that these have less capacity overall when you delve into the data.However for some devices, these our a necessity as NIMH rechargeable don’t provide enough voltage for items to work correctly.  One instance is a little submarine with a simple motor my daughter has for the pool.  An Eneloop AA fails to get the motor to perform as the voltage is too low, however the Tenevolts AA powers it around the pool.These batteries also work better for my Z wave locks, as the NIMH eneloops worked, but the locking action wasn’t as crisp, and sometimes would fail.  When you factor in the fact that each lock takes 4 batteries, the NIMH had a bit lower voltage overall.However, one device that does work better with eneloops was my Halloween LED village, with about 9 small led lights.  Some eneloop AA would keep the lights up and running for days on end, Although not as bright as the tenevolts.  However the tenevolts only would last about a day at max brightness, and when they started  to get low and run out, would strobe and flicker the lights.  It must have something to do with the circuitry providing the step down voltage, but they didn’t last even close to as long.They aren't bad, but unless you need the extra voltage go with Nimh rechargeables.\n",
      "Good value I have not had it long but so far so good. I am trying to eliminate the constant purchase of batteries for my remotes so I purchased this to try and see if this will save money in the long run.\n",
      "Don’t mix with traditional rechargeables Got these on sale and worth every penny. Just make sure you keep them separated from NiMH battery chargers (and don’t charge NiMH batteries in the included charger).\n",
      "Good but not for all purpose If you need high output current, buy regular rechargeable battery. Buy for constant low output current, this is pretty good.\n",
      "They are a full 1.5 volts, not 1.25 volts like less expensive batteries Good life\n",
      "Great battery charger Batteries are well made and hold a long charge, the charger is also made heavy duty to last a long time\n",
      "Awesome Batteries I got these batteries because they were on sale with a coupon code to get it for $11. I probably wouldn’t buy these for their normal price. They are great. Once I got them, I threw them in my La Crosse charger and charged them up. I am currently using them in a pair of XBOX One S controllers and wow! They lasts a long time! I have 4 of the Amazon Basics rechargeable, the grey with the green ring, along with the white ones and they lasts maybe 2-3 days. The same Tenavolt batteries are in the controller for over a week now and it still shows the battery is full. Each time we use the Amazon ones, even after a full charge, it will show maybe 80% charged in the controller, that is probably due to the batteries not charging to 1.5v I will buy more of these if there is ever a sale again, since spending $35 for 4x plus a charger I don’t need is kind of expensive.\n",
      "Long lasting for my Sangean digital radio but adds distortion to the sound I picked these up for a Sangean radio which eats through rechargeable batteries like crazy. The radio requires a set of four AA's. And even with the 2450 mAh ones, I can barely get a few days of use from the radio before I need to open up the battery compartment, test which battery is weak or dead, then replace it. What's especially annoying is the fact that only one of the four battery need be weak or dead for the radio to shut down. For most devices I've owned, the remaining batteries can compensate well enough for a weak or dead battery. But not this Sangean radio.Flash forward, I decide to try these batteries to see if they make a positive difference. And they do.. lasting much longer in this radio than all previous and ordinary rechargeables.BUT... pretty quickly after I started using these TENAVOLTS, I started noticing a lot of static in the radio speaker. So much so, that it's become unlistenable. When I place standard rechargeables or alkaline batteries back again, the sound is clear once again.  So these TENAVOLTS are creating some kind of interference.  Bummer! Back to the battery drawing board, I guess.\n",
      "Nicely done Great product\n",
      "Nice Li-ion batteries for the money Batteries charge easily and seem to last. I like the blue LED indicators on each battery to show when the charge is complete. Great for remote controls or any item that does not have excessive power requirements, such as a camera flash. Best to use NiMH for those. Only caveat is you can only charge Tenavolts batteries with this charger, or at least they say that. I haven't tried.\n",
      "working as advertised i belive these are atleast as equal to kentli batteries....my ATN scope cant tell the difference. it a power hungry unit that needs 1.5v batteries. kentlies are gret BUT i had a couple \"short out\" and rise To 3.7v!!! luckly the ATN oveload protection cicuit worked and shut itself down...the unit was unharmed except that the spike caused it to wipe out its settings. so i just re booted the scope after reloading the firmware again and all is good. SO ...only time will tell if the tenavolts hold up better...its been a month since i purchased them and 3 charge cycles later ....so far so good\n",

      "Very good lithium batteries These work great for my digital camera are great and nice\n",
      "Good idea. Only good for remote control (IMO) Good idea but failed to satisfy. I originally used AA rechargeable NiMH batters for a flashlight I keep on my hard hat and for a laser lever for work. The problem with the NiMH is that they dim and take FOREVER to charge. What I didn’t like about the LI-ion batteries is that they made my flashlight super hot and they die very quickly!!! I can go through the 4 batteries within an 8 hour work day. I’m not using the flashlight the entire 8 hours but I do use it quite often. I recently just purchased a flashlight that uses true 3.7v cell LI-ion batteries. The AA 1.5v LI-ion are not really AA batteries. They are smaller 3.7v LI-ion batteries with a AA housing that use circuitry to convert 3.7v to 1.5v. The conversion naturally consumes energy that could otherwise be used by the device and the circuitry takes up space. Would not recommend. Maybe for a remote control for the TV. Something that is on for less that 2 minutes a day if you don’t like changing batteries a lot\n",
      "Have not had long enough to tell longevity. Will be using in Zoom Handy Cam. So far so Good. Charger seems simple, lights go on when putting batteries in, and then all go out right away. I assume the batteries are precharged but should have a light on saying that.\n",

The cable will not plug into either unit unless I take the components out of their shell, then it works fine.\n",

      "Great Batteries For Every Devices I had bought this battery because of 100% full brightness throughout the charge batteries as the one time time use batteries will fade down to dimmer to even more dimmer as the batteries is getting weaker. With NiMH rechargeable batteries; because of 1.35 volt instead of 1.5 volt. Even at full 100% of charged; you'll get around 90% then it will slowly goes down to 80% with very long lasting light per charge. With this new 1.5 continue voltage level throughout the charge that will make Cree LED flashlight at the fullest brightness even this batteries is at the 10% left in charged until BMS built-into each battery will cut-off. From the fullest brightness until it's goes dark. Recharge time up to 1200 time is far better than 500 times on NiMH rechargeable AA batteries.\n",
      "Excellent cold weather application batteries These batteries and the charger work great. Perfect for use in sub-freezing applications like a freezer remote thermometer.\n",
      "very cool tech No one seems to have noticed the neatest thing about these batteries.  They charge directly with 5V.  The charger that comes with them isn't a charger, it's just a 5V splitter.  The charger is built into the battery, which explains why the charge light is on the battery itself.  That's why they don't work in any other charger, and no other batteries work in this 'charger'.  This is similar to all the other USB-plug lithium batteries for sale, but without taking the space for a socket or plug they can fit more capacity in these batteries.  In the attached photo you can see that each battery can be charged separately, each drawing 500mA.  Since 5V USB power is ubiquitous and I don't have to worry about the charger breaking I feel comfortable getting more of these.\n",
      "Tenavolts AA Lithium 1.5 constant volt Got these to replace the Alkaline cells I constantly go thru. I don't know why it took me so long to switch over to these Lithium 1.5 constant volt batteries.I use a coffee throffer stur device and it would eat a set of standard AA batteries every 2 weeks and these have been going for over a month now with our a charge. Love these batteries. Think I'll be getting more of them for my GPS battery eater. Thanks for the great Lithium  batteries Tenavolt!!!\n",

      "Impressive Product I'm not a battery expert by any stretch of the imagination so I couldn't tell you about volts this or mWh that, but I can say I am impressed with these batteries as a Regular Joe. I have gotten a few different sets of entry level and cheap rechargeables for various devices over the years. Performance is usually somewhere between acceptable and lukewarm. These TENAVOLTS were a game changer though. The longevity on a charge is very noticeable in the peripherals I've been using them in (bluetooth Xbox controller and WMR wands which can be finicky with batteries). They perform well beyond anything I've tried prior and charge consistently fast. My only mark against them would be that there's no wall outlet plug, but my PC case has USB right in the front and it's convenient enough. I'm very happy.\n",

USB charging cable convenience. No need to search for a Power outlet. we can recharge using a Laptop or any other USB power source.2. Super fast recharge. Charges up in less than 2 hours. That;s fast for AA batteries.3. Lasting battery life on each recharge.4. Lasted for 8 hours of continuous gaming.Negative:None I could think of.

They fully charge in about 90 minutes and appear to be high-capacity.  They last for a long time before having to be reacharged again. So much better than the old NiCad rechargeables - these are lithium and last much longer.  I also really like that they can charge via USB cord - this makes it easy to charge them as we have lots of other USB devices.  I'm pretty happy with the purchase so far...  They claim to last for 1,000 cycles, I guess we will see.\n",

I took them out immediately since I was afraid they might explode or start on fire. There's also a dark spot in the center of the flashlight beam now like part of the LED burned out or something. Don't waste your money on these. They'll wreck your devices and cost you a ton of money replacing whatever it is or they'll just start a fire and your house will burn down.\n",

I bought the 4-battery TENAVOLTS rechargeable lithium batteries for my Oculus Rift controllers - they had previously been eating through AA batteries like crazy, and my miscellaneous 5-??? year old NiCd batteries weren't holding a charge anymore. I was surprised to see lithium in rechargeable AA batteries - I don't know much about batteries but people were saying good things about them. Anyways, here's what matters:PROS:+ Super easy to use. Plug into computer USB port (I think it says not to use an outlet), pop batteries into the convenient little carrying case, wait for blue light to go off. Tadah - charged.+ Long-lasting. I was surprised, since my previous rechargeable batteries got eaten up by my controllers. These guys last me a week or two of high-intensity Beat Saber before I have to swap to the other pair.+ Comes with carrying case. I've lost so many rechargeable batteries I can't keep count of them. These guys come with a little box for you to leave your batteries in, which helps me keep track of them.CONS:- Charging cable is super short. The included charging cable is maybe 8 inches long, so you can't really leave the charger away on your desk somewhere. It also doesn't seem to work for other devices. That being said, this is a really minor gripe.Overall, I really like these batteries. If for some weird reason I end up using other AA-powered electronics in the future, I'll probably be getting more of these.\n",

And with those flashlights I want to drive them and make them as bright as possible, hence why I purchased these batteries. A lot of my rechargeable batteries drain too quickly, doesn't fully provide the 1.5V or take too long to charge. Regular disposable AA works great, but a bit wasteful. Overall, I've had these for a while and I love them. I will purchase more for the rest of my AA devices (mainly flashlights!)Battery Size: I've included some pictures of the batteries compared to AA Amazon basic disposable and AA Amazon basic Rechargeable. These are actually almost identical to the regular AA and smaller than the Amazon Basic rechargeable.

Some devices are sensitive to voltage and NIMH batteries may not work. One example is a flashlight I own which is dim with NIMH. I had been using single use lithium batteries which are expensive and get thrown away.I also like the case / charger. I did notice it charges at 500mA and no option for 200mA although it looks like you can use a NIMH charger to charge these and Choi’s 200mA.  Generally charging at lower mA means more cycles. Longer total life. The charger also has slots for AAA which they don’t seem to make but hopefully they doAnd soon.\n",
      "Constant voltage! Some of my devices require alot of power & others just need consistent power. And we all know, everyone uses batteries for at least tv remotes & wireless computer mice, so why not use rechargeable batteries. They are cost effective & can be recharged a 1000 times over.The devices I use that need consistent voltage are my remote controlled devices, such as rc transmitters & rc vehicles.These 760mah lithium rechargeable batteries will last just as long as my 2800mah NiMH rechargeable batteries if not better. With my NiMH, as the battery drains, the voltage drops, and makes motors sluggish. Lithium batteries maintain a constant voltage & have no memory effect. One thing I have learned is to make sure to only charge lithium batteries with the charger they came with, as they have special circuitry inside.As these batteries are a recent advancement in technology, they should become more readily available in different sizes in the near future.Overall, these are excellent AA batteries that come with their own charger which also acts as a storage case.\n",
      "Great value set  This is a cool charger. I love everything about it. The thing i love the most is the blue color lights on the batteries. I have never seen anything like that before so it is awesome in my opinion. Secondly, the compact charger that can actually charge both AA or AAA batteries. You can't beat the flexibility this gives.\n",
      "So far so good. I bought these because the rechargeable battery packs in my Xbox One controllers were starting to wear down. Since I have three controllers I went ahead and bought two of these and they have been performing flawlessly. I'm not sure of the actual duration of playtime that this batteries last for but I can say that I only have to switch them out to charge maybe once every two weeks.Would definitely recommend.\n",
      "Surprisingly Good - Normal Price Way Too High I bought these at a deep discount from Amazon. I have since used them in a couple of applications: (a) a beard trimmer and (b) a BT->Infrared adapter. I have had great success with both. The full 1.5v delivered runs the beard trimmer motor faster than with a 1.2v Eneloop. And even faster, it seems, than an alkaline. The adapter seems to monitor voltage as it judges when its batteries are dead and with these, that happens far less quickly than with 1.2v Eneloop. Not idea in all applications, I am sure - especially trickle use like clocks. But for flashlights, motors, and others they seem quite good. Two caveats: (a) when these are emptied out, they go from full-power to zero-power immediately. There is no warning period. (b) You MUST use the included charger - you cannot charge them in other chargers. At the regular retail price I would not likely buy more. But when the price drops down to where I got mine originally, I will definitely buy more.\n",
      "Does what it states Great long lasting battery\n",
      "Rechargeable batteries Good rechargeable batteries. 1.5 v\n",
      "Oh my gosh. AA Lithium Ion at 1.5 volts.  Oh my gosh, I'm over the moon.  Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you.\n",
      "So much better than nimh rechargeables These have been in absolute lifesaver in my windows mixed reality headset controllers. A set up for double A's normally only lasts a few hours of gaming , but these have lasted days and charge back up quickly. I was very surprised to find such a long-lasting set of rechargeable batteries that actually worked in standard 1.5v application. I can't speak to how this would work in very demanding devices, but for VR controllers they are excellent.\n",
      "They don’t work I’m not sure if I just received lemons or what the deal is. I would have preferred to reach the company directly but no option to do that. All charge fine. 3 of 4 go into my portable water pic. It works fine for about 30 seconds and dies. I remove the batteries to find one completely dead on the tester. It has happened every time, always a different battery. It’s not the unit, works fine with eveready rechargeables. Threw out original packaging so can’t return (who would have thought)\n",
      "Good value Long lasting life for Xbox controller.\n",
      "Single use battery. First attempt to recharge caused 'Battery Error' message. I purchased this product thinking it would be rechargeable and hoped to get a longer lasting battery between each charge as well as more charges overall compared to other rechargeable brands. Much to my dismay when the charge ran out and I tried to recharge it I got a message stating there was a \"Battery Error\" on my Uniden Bearcat BCD436HP portable scanner. I would discourage anyone from buying anything from TENAVOLTS.\n",
      "it works but not great It works for me but the battery life is not the best, not sure if I'm using it the right way, but that's my experience, would only get it if it is on sell\n",
      "Not durable. Not durable.\n",
      "Solid power, consistant results. Delivers good power to wireless transmitters.  I have a critical application with handheld microphones and these work far better than other rechargeable types (NiMH, NiCD, Alkaline).  Solid power and consistent results.\n",
      "First time buying rechargable lithium batteries. So far so good. I got these on sale so bought 4 with a charger. I like them so well after the first use I ordered 4 more.  Charge fast and seem to have plenty of power. Works in everything I've tried. Only have AA's but will watch for other sizes. From what I've read I'd like to have some big ones for house batteries on our motorhome.  Very expensive for that though. I'll add more if I have any problems but right now these are doing great.\n",
      "Works great! I have been using these in my son's toys, and they have held up great.  They do not take a long time to charge, yet last a good amount of time.  The quality of how they are made is also better than most rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "good for security camera, not as good as NiMH I use these in Blink security cameras which don't like normal rechargeables (they just say the battery is low all the time due to lower voltage). These lasted 3 months in a Blink camera in a high use area. which gets 10-20 events daily. Normally I'd say these lithium AA arent worth the premium as they don't last as long as NiMH (regular rechargeables) but in this niche case they work great as they provide a steady 1.5 volts. However, there is a down side..there's no warning when they die.\n",
      "One charge lasts long, very easy to recharge These batteries are very good. The battery time of one charge is also longer than a normal battery. Easy to recharge and reuse.\n",
      "If you have Windows Mixed Reality controllers, buy these batteries and literally nothing else I have gone through many different sets of batteries for my WMR controllers until someone suggested me these batteries. I didn't believe him at first until I bought them and have never had an issue since! All my older batteries would give a low battery warnung after 30 minutes of using the controller and I used to think it was just a software issue or a WMR issue and ignored it and was ok with the battery life. These batteries are on a whole different level. They have a circuit that keeps them consistent at 1.5 volts and when you charge them they individually have a little led on the negative end to tell you that its charging. Overall highly recommended for WMR users who just want to play their games and not worry about controller life anymore\n",
      "Super Long Battery Life I'm impressed. Excellent battery life. I use them in a live music performance setting and they far exceed my expectations so far.\n",
      "Died to fast You claim these batteries are high quality but died after about half hour of use. Tested it and energizer batteries lasted longer\n",
      "Good value Work like a cham and last very long on shure microphone. We use everyday for 4-5 hrs per day and last for whole week.\n",
      "Good to buy It is nice battery, good for kid toys specially. I was really happy with this one.\n",
      "Good rechargeable batteries for heavy usage Has been trying out this for a week since it arrived. The batteries are lighter comparing to eneloops, but it seems to hold charger for heavy usage electronics such as RF wireless microphones and audio recorders. The regular eneloops usually last ~ 6hrs in my audio recorders but this set lasts ~8hrs without dropping voltage.\n",
      "Quality product I am highly impressed with this seller.  I had an issue and they bent over backwards to help me out.  The person that answered my email resolved the issue with replacement parts AND included a hand written note, apologizing and thanking me for buying their product.  Are you kdding me!  What company or employee takes the time to do that!  So impressed with the service and product!!  The batteries themselves work as advertised.  I have not noticed if they last longer or shorter than a good alkaline battery as I have not made any actual comparisons.  They seem to last about the same as a regular battery but rechargeable.\n",
      "AA Li battery Very well build and looks good quality, comes with charger.\n",
      "The longest lasting battery on market I have 12 of them and use them in Hand held GPS for hunting trips. Last 19 hours, 3 more than the Duracell copper top. Why so many negative reviews?\n",
      "Nicely Made and Excellent Replacements These are very well made batteries and come with a high quality charger.  One of the cool features that you don't see in the add is that the batteries have LED indicators  as well.\n",
      "so far so good, much better than my envelop battery I bought 2 sets of these, use one set for my entry door death bolt keypad, they are so much better than regular alkaline and NiMH.  The lock opens much better now without jam.  The other set is used on a digital scale at work, and they're much better than my NiMH.  Well worth the price after coupon and discount.will see how long these last, but so far so good\n",
      "Best Oculus Go and Quest Batteries Bought these for use with the Oculus Quest, now I don't have to change the batteries every week.\n",

      "Comparison of voltage between different types and brands of AA size batteries. This is my initial review, I'll post updates after I test them out.Voltage comparison: (fresh of package, not charged up yet)Duracell: 1.54vEneloop: 1.35vNi-Zn: 1.71vTenavolts (Li-ion poly): 1.51vI wanted batteries close to 1.5v because some of the electronics don't like the 1.3-1.35 volts of NiMHand each of the different chemical types of batteries perform differently in situations, I'll report back.Yes, there are better Ni-Zn (or at least more expensive) out there, but I'm going for the best bang for the buck.I'm giving this all stars until proven otherwise.\n",
      "Excellent...more power than most I am very happy with this purchase.  I think this puts out 1.5v which is a little higher than most so I get the maximum power.  I'm using them in an electric razor and I've been using them for about a month on a single charge.  No sign of needing to recharge soon.  Things like remote controls or other slow draining devices might not need this kind of battery but if you're replacing batteries every few weeks, this is an excellent choice.Only negative--I got it on sale so maybe the regular price is a little high.\n",
      "Decent rechargeable batteries These batteries do their job very well for the most part. The charge lasts well compared to other rechargable batteries that these compete with. The only main concerns for these batteries are that they can only be recharged with the charging platform that came with the batteries and that the microUSB cable that came with the platform was really small, making it hard to keep charging on an outlet.\n",
      "Where is the ac charger? I did not get an adapter to recharge the batteries. What good is a car without gasoline. I will never touch such a product and a company that is stingy to supply an ac  charger.\n",
      "great battery Got these on sale and well worth the money\n",
      "powerful battery This thing holds up! had it in my shaver and after some uses it still turns on at full speed!\n",
      "Grandson loves them This was part of my 8 year old grandson's birthday present because he asked for batteries for his birthday. He goes through a lot of batteries for his Xbox controller, so I thought this would work well for him. He's been using these for weeks now and says that the first charged pair hasn't even ran down yet, so he loves it. Hopefully these will last him for years, and no more disposable batteries.\n",
      "Highly recommend Great product!\n",
      "USB cable too short I got 4 rechargeable batteries, with a USB charger, but no adapter. Should let me know earlier. The USB cable is short. I have tried those batteries and they works good\n",
      "Great For WMR VR controllers Samsung Odyessy I bought these specifically for  My windows mixed reality controllers that chew threw batteries in hours. These aren't the cheapest but they are the best for my case. They last long enough to were you don't have to worry about them dying and they charge super fast. The 1.5v  keep my controllers from ever losing tracking and I can get 6+hrs  of use  no problemI use the Samsung odyssey WMR HMD and these are the best\n",
      "Exceeded Expectations I am using this for my 6 Blink cameras and this has last for 3 weeks now without recharge. I know only drawback will be that my Cameras will go offline suddenly without warning as it does not reduces voltage when running out of juice.I wish we had something like this when we had aaa battery powered cameras in olden times. It will be one of my gift to myself if I could travel back in time.\n",
      "Works perfecr for blink Works perfect for Blink\n",
      "High capacity battery aat modest cost Needed additional rechargeable batteries for my many remote controls.\n",
      "They just keep going and going! These batteries last a long time. Best rechargeable batteries I have bought yet.\n",
      "Fast charging batteries and charger USB supported battery charger with fast charger and long lasting batteries. LED indicators are great to help understand when charging is over. Supports AA and AAA batteries getting charged together and doesn’t need pair batteries for charging. Small size makes it easy to store. Great product, highly recommended!!\n",

      "Good for travel High quality 1.5V lithium rechargeable batteries with charger that can fast charge the batteries. This set is very portable and good for travel.\n",
      "The longevity of the batteries I bought the batteries and charger because we go through batteries quite a bit in my household. This will help the environment and keep dollars in my pocket\n",
      "Powerful Batteries. We were in need of a new battery system that was rechargeable but also would generate enough battery power to keep our wireless mics and packs for our church. These are in the Sennheiser EW100 G3 mics for up to 5 hours and still maintain full charge.Have yet to test how long they actually last, but I was presently surprised!\n",
      "Not great for Blink Camera. Good for game controller. These put out the voltage they claim. They charge up fine. But, they're not really a replacement for Energizer lithium batteries in my Blink cameras. They only power them for about 1/10th of the time as the Energizers. I'm finding these most useful in my xbox one controller. These are the only batteries that show the controller at completely full power in the dashboard.\n",
      "NO, You CANNOT charge these with a 'regular' Lithium ion Charger! Some people in some purchase forums like [Slickdeals] are claiming you CAN charger these with a normal Li-on charger, you don't need the proprietary charger.IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY.I have about 7 high end multi-chemistry and dedicated Li-on chargers. I did some tests.  Indeed you can put them in a Li-on charger, the blue base will light up and it will start charging.BUT----IT WILL TERMINATE/STOP PREMATURELY, not filling the battery properly.On my tests I could only charge 600mAh to these cells with a regular Li-on charger, which have ~1600-1700mAh.When removed from the Li-on charger and placed in the Tenavolt charger they would continue to charger for over an hour.\n",
      "Perfect for Windows Mixed Reality Controllers I use these with my Samsung Odyssey+ WMR controllers. Normal NiMH batteries don't work well with the controllers because the voltage is too low and the controller will give you low battery warnings and turn off rumble way before the batteries are dead.These 1.5v lithium batteries work great. No more low battery warnings.\n",
      "excellent all cells check out 1.5v.  i have not yet used any of them.  dont forget to remove the plastic barrier inside or the green charging lite will stay on.\n",
      "Thanks for li-on batteries Li-on Batteries are good and last a long time. Really like these batteries and will be buying more.\n",
      "Rechargeable These batteries are good quality and will most definitely pay for themselves over their lifetime.\n",
      "excellent value for his pricepoint they last longer than older models and worth the money\n",
      "Holding up great after some use Bought these for use in some devices that perform better with Lithium battery options and have not been disappointed.the charger was easy to setup and use.Indicators about changing vs. charged were easy to identify and made using them a snap.Now after a few weeks of use, very impressed by the and I consider them a great value.Definitely give these a look if you need Lithium rechargeables in your devices.\n"

Unfortunately, when testing these fully charged batteries on my TT685 unit, it took 10 seconds to recahrge after the first test fire. A typical Sanyo Eneloop took about 2 seconds. Also when i took the Tenavolt batteries out after 2 test fires, the contacts on both sides almost burnt my finger.Maybe, I am missing some new technology, but the manufacturer does not mention that this battery has a capacity of only 760 mAh!!I ended up returning this. not worth the money, performance loss, or fire risk.\n",
      "Good batterys and recharger I like that they last on the shelf much longer than Ncad or Nmh and they supply a full 1.5 volt. Got these on a flash sale so were a really great deal! Will get more on the next sale/\n",
      "Not for camera flash use These fail after 10 pops in a camera flash (and their promo video specifically showed a photographer using a flash with great results).  They just stop working, and need to go back to the charger.  Tried 4 sets with same results.  Something is wrong with the voltage and calibration in high drain devices.  I've heard from others that these have a very small window of products they will work well in.  So, I wouldn't use them in anything critical, but maybe they'll be good for the tv remote.\n",
      "Great buy! Doubted why these batteries cost this much, but felt it’s premium once I got them. They look great too, like the starry sky! The charging box is compact so won’t take up too much space. These are for my father-in-law, who eats batteries very often lol He loves them so much! He told me it’s easy to charge & lasts longer compared to other batteries he purchased. He was like “it would be even better if there are more” I know right then just pay for it. Just found out these are relatively cheaper lol Thinking buy more, at least one more box for our own\n",
      "Works as expected so far So far these batteries are working much better in my Apple wireless trackpad when compared to using NiMh rechargeable batteries.  I have only gone through 3 cycles so far but the Tenavolts last about 10 days longer.  After a few more cycles I would expect the difference to be even larger.  The Tenavolts as expected run until they don't.  In other words they maintain 1.5 volts until the end when they stop.  This is compared to the NiMh batteries where the voltage goes down over time and slowly fail.  We will see how many cycles the Tenavolts are good for as I am tracking every cycle that each battery goes through and will update as my testing goes on.  But so far very happy with the performance.  A little bit expensive but if they perform as described by the manufacturer they may well be worth it.\n",

I am using these batteries in a digital night vision scope with IR illuminator.Hunting, using the illuminator kills regular alkaline batteries, 2 hrs max.I bought these when they were on sale, pleasantly surprised at the performance.Have been on 3 outings so far, and scope has yet to show power being down a bar.Very pleased.SY\n",
      "Long battery life The battery is goof. Long battery life and charges quickly. I use it for my gaming controller and it works good . good product.\n",
      "Nice batteries These batteries not only charge very fast but also last pretty long. I used them for my gaming remote controller. Energizer batteries just die after a period of time if not in use when keeping them in the remote controllers. These tenavolts batteries however retain their power quite well after keeping them in the controller and not been used for couple months or so. Definitely worth buying some rechargeable batteries for all purpose.\n",
      "Take the batteries out of the charger and remove plastic barrier or you do not see blue lights. The blue light is on the battery itself. It will light when the plastic barrier is removed. When fully charged the blue light on the end of the battery goes out. The green light just means you have it plugged into your laptop. The funny cable that comes with the package plugs right into a normal USB port.\n",

      "WOW!! Rechargeable Lithium battery, 1.5v, wow, just wow!! I used it with door cam that runs on 4 1.v batteries and then switched i to my son's remote controller for all terrain vehicle. Unlike the traditional rechargeables, this seem to last forever. I'm sold for its current performance, I just hope the built in voltage controller and battery itself last long enough to justify the price.\n",

      "Horrible product Did not want to charge correctly so either batteries are bad or the charger or the cable have no idea\n",
      "Works better than my other batteries. I compared these to NiMH batteries sold at the local store in some wall candles. I got 27 days worth of 5 hours run time each day from Tenavolts. I got 26 days from the other ones but when I went to recharge the NiMH, one was defective. I threw those out and went back to the Tenavolts with no problems. Might try Eneloops next that seem popular.\n",

      "Best rechargeable batteries on the market I love these rechargeable batteries. I already have the charger for this with AA batteries and these fit right in there since they have AAA and AA slots. I have been trying to convert all my battery powered electronics to rechargeable or alternative solutions and these are great to have.They don't take very long to charge at all, Get a full charge in 1.8 hours.More faster than Traditional Ni-MH rechargeable batteries needed 3 hours to charge fully. I have had zero issues at all with them holding a charge and they always seem to be supplying the right amount of power (1.5v).\n",

      "These are horrible I can't tell when these batteries are charging, the instructions were extremely poor.  I bought two of these packs, and one isn't working properly (and I can't figure out how to troubleshoot).  Very frustrated with this purchase.  The only way to check if the batteries are charged is to put them in a device and see.  The charger should be a better quality.\n",
      "Terribly Disaponted I got charger and 4 AA batteries. After charing them overnight they still didn't perform as as advertised voltage of 1.5.Is this a sham?\n",

      "Lithium rechargeable batteries, why not This is a product I bought for my church as I'm the director of the sound equipment. I love how it's charger is only for these batteries so other departments in my church can't charge their batteries. I love the value as these feel like premium batteries and function as much. I've had them for a week and they do exactly as needed. I connected the USB to the computer so power is not an issue. I definitely would recommend this as well as ask for a larger amount of 4 batteries.\n",
      "Not satisfactory I have returned this product to Amazon. After fully charging them, I first tried them in a camera flash. I got about ten flashes before the flash indicated the batteries were dead. I checked the cell voltages, and of the four, two read 1.5 volts and the other two read 0.9 volts. So although the flash puts the four cells in series, the batteries were not sharing the load amongst themselves, and two discharged more than the other two. I recharged all four and put a pair in a Maglite, which quit after eight minutes.This product is a nice idea that isn’t working out in practice.\n",

Fast charging, love the red/green light indicator for each port, doesn't hog the wall outlet, charges all my rechargeable batteries. Put the EBL type in my tv remote, am curious to see how long they last before needing recharged compared to the others I have.\n",

      "Good value Works well like it\n",
      "Fantastic Charger Well-built charger that can handle up to 8 batteries at a time. It can still work even if an odd number of batteries are inserted. In addition, the LED indicators are helpful for knowing when the charging is completed. Yep, batteries hold their life for quite a while.\n",
      "Awesome charger Im a big fan of EBL rechargeable batteries. I have a 9v pack of theirs, 2 different AAA & AA charging bases, plus a bunch of batteries. I really like this charging base cause it can charge one battery at a time and charging time is way faster than my other one. It works really well. I highly recommend it.\n",

      "Cannot complain! Love this set!!! Batteries charge quickly with the charger and they came in a perfect amount for all of my gaming controllers. Conveniently sized charger and I have micro usb cables everywhere so I can always find a spot to plug them in.\n",
      "Worst batteries I have ever tried These batteries last much less than a regular alkaline battery. They drained the energy really fast even when are not en used. Please do not waste your money on this product.\n",
      "Good choice! The charger looks durable and I really enjoy installing 8 batteries in it at one time. Time & money saver! Not expensive to get this charging set at all. In addition, the compact size allows you to transfer it anywhere you want. Good to have USB input which provides you with multiple charging options. The LED indicator is nice too.\n",
      "Charger works very well Chargers works better that some others that we have had, compatibility with other batteries does not seem to be a problem.  The life of these AA and AAA batteries is much better than some of the alkaline batteries we have used.\n",
      "Practical charging set. Haven't used the batteries so often but they seem to be fully charged in a short time. The LED light is very useful to know when the batteries are fully charged. No charging or leakage issues as well.\n",
      "So far so good. Awesome charger that will charge 8 batteries at the same time, AA and AAA together as well!!! The charger also came with 8 EBL 2800mAh AA batteries, which is big plus. Working great so far...\n",
      "Good price Good battery charger. The ability to fast charge 8 batteries at a time makes it invaluable.\n",
      "Better!!! Much better than my former charger. Charges more batteries quicker. In this respect, this product is worth five stars. Plus, the attached AA & AAA batteries charge fast and last a long time. Some batteries may get warm while charging, but it may be normal.\n",
      "Good value. Great fast charger for both AA and AAA. Love the individual battery charging system, really giving me much convenience for daily life. Besides, the batteries themselves are just better than my old ones.\n",
      "Great product This is a great product with 2 sizes of reachable batteries\n",
      "GOOD Haven't bought batteries since I bought this battery and charger kit. The rechargeable batteries last longer than all other batteries. And I really like the USB charger. That way I can use it in the house or car. No complaints.\n",
      "best partner for rechargeable batteries Great product. I highly recommend.. so far they work nicely and every thing is just ok. If you are seeking for a powerful battery charger to charge up you batteries, this budget pick may be your best choice.\n",
      "trustworthy EBL product This is a practical product containing batteries and charger. The working status is normal and steady. Besides, it charges fast for my rechargeable batteries! Buy it!\n",
      "The charger works very well. Works well for AA AAA batteries. Has an indicator light to show the charging status of the battery for each slot. Doesn't get hot when charging eight batteries at the same time. Great product.\n",
      "5 stars absolutely I'm not an electrical engineer so that i couldn’t say anything professional about this product. But i would like speak highly of this because it’s much better than those old ones i have ever used. This new charger does work OK in everything else I've tried them in, and the batteries as the same. They work well.\n",
      "Five stars Using rechargeable batteries is economical and eco-friendly. And having this charger is very handy. The indicator lights that show you the charging states are easy to see all the way across the room.\n",
      "Hats off. My 2nd time purchasing from EBL. AA batteries just perform as well as usual. They last a very long time in all sorts of applications. Wonderful charger in this package too. My favorite is the USB input, which provides more possibilities for charging.\n",
      "Great value. Great value for us as we always go through batteries quite frequently. We love using rechargeable batteries as it is good for the environment. And this charger charges quickly, it is a must to have item.\n",
      "great in all respects The batteries with the charger come to me swiftly. Frankly speaking, we are a little skeptical ago about this product because we had never bought any product from EBL before. This is the first time we’ve purchased a product from this brand, but they really surprised us! Each battery has longer battery life and the charger are well compatible with the batteries!\n",
      "Does what it suppose to do. IMHO, EBL batteries are quite comparable to name brands like Duracell. But I did not expect its charger to be so good. It did not take long to charge 8 batteries at a time. Besides, bright green lights reminded me that charging was completed. And to my surprise, the charging slots are all independent, which means I can charge one battery if I want.\n",
      "Practico y fasil de usar Mui bueno y llabiene con pilas para usar\n",
      "It Just Works! Fits perfectly for AA and AAA cells. Some have complained that you can't charge 8 AAs at one go, but it can be done. I connected mine to an Anker wall charger and it charged 8 cells with no issue. Just ensure you supply enough current to the charger.\n",
      "The best value battery/ charger with great quality. Great quality batteries. Charger is very well made, not like the cheap, plasticky off brand products. Charges fast and batteries are long lasting. Great for use in camera flash units. Highly recommended.\n",
      "This is a GREAT product. Work for 8 AA's and AAA's no problem. Really happy with this charger, and I use it quite often.\n",
      "Only charges some rechargeables Apparently like most low-end chargers,  about 1/2 my high-end Eneloop rechargeable batteries flash orange ( Meaning this charger thinks they are defective). These same \"defective\" batteries charge flawlessly in my high-end $50 charger. Only bought this $10 charger to keep in my RV, returned it not worth the hassle!\n",
      "Definitely worth it So far so good. The great feature that it can charge so many batteries at a time is a big, big plus. And the indicator light makes it very easy to see whether the battery is fully charged or not. Would highly recommend.\n",
      "great battery charger The battery charger is so sturdy and quality in the process of charging. It has 8 slots in all and could charge up 8pcs of batteries at once. Since all the performance are pleasing, i am willing to speak highly of this product!\n",
      "excelente es un artículo perfecto recomiendo comprarlo funciona excelente\n",
      "i wanna buy it again I have only a charger for home use now. And this almost does all the work for us. It charges up the AA and AAA batteries fast and sturdily without any issues. Also, there is no overheat occurring! Great quality!\n",
      "Works well This charger worked fine. It was very convenient. It was sleek and well made. We had no problem using it or setting it up. It was pretty self-explanatory. I like all of the charging options. I like that the LED light shows the progress. We had no problems with it. I would recommend it.\n",
      "full star rating The charger is the saviour for our batteries. It has a white look and feels so sturdy on my hand. There are independent indicators for showing the charging status. I attach much importance to the safety of a electronic devices and this charger meets my requirement. It’s reliable and the price is reasonable!\n",
      "Won’t charge aaa This charger does not say how to charge AAA\n",
      "best charger I am a photographer so I use tons of AA batteries. This charger lets you know as each battery is charged, so I can switch out one at a time as the day goes by instead of waiting until they are all charged.  I get so many more charged this way.  I love it.\n",
      "Saves money on regular batteries They work well.\n",
      "Works well and met our needs No issues with the charger.  It was ready to go right out of the box.\n",
      "Great value! I love the product however it would be nice to have an optional direct current charge option with the USB as well.\n",
      "best of all The battery charger is of higher quality and availability. The former one i bought from the mall is now broken. We always have to charge up a series of AAA and AA batteries at home so this 8-bay charger is pretty useful for us. It charges quite steadily and fast. Totally satisfied!\n",
      "Love it Love it.  Being able to charge one at a time or up to eight at once is  great.  Knowing when each individual battery is charged is real helpful as well.\n",
      "Its okay I just got this product a couple of days ago but it seems to not work properly.  it says the batteries aren't charged after a unplug the charger and plug it back in. I'm not sure whats going on It took me a couple of days to charge my batteries\n",
      "Good, but have your own power brick Bad: doesn’t come with a charging block. The first one of mine I tried didn’t work to charge more than 4 batteries.It has really aggressive dimples on the one side that marred up my batteries.Good: once I got a suitably power supply it changered my batteries quickly. I like the individual lights it has.\n",
      "Good for the price I haven't had any issues with this charger so far, and the price is nice.\n",
      "I like the individuality of the charging positions I need to charge 15 AAA for some wireless lighting and the separate bays work great.\n",
      "Handy Can charge 1 or more batteries of either or both AA and AAA.  Comes in real handy when you use rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "Almost Perfect Charger Inexpensive what to charge your nicad batteries (not included). The plastic is cheap so I wouldn't suggest charging them when not at home but should be fine otherwise. You can use AA or AAA or mix them. I use a charging brick (not included) to plug into fir power but you can also use a computer (which I haven't tried). The lights turn from red to green when finished and they're bright enough not to be noticed.Overall a nice charger.\n",
      "Simple and easy to use This is a battery charger with 8 bays. The device measures approximately 5”x3”1”. It has a single port on side, USB micro for power. It ships with a USB A to USB micro power cable, but no transformer. The charger has 8 bays. Each bay can hold either 1 AA battery or 1 AAA battery. Above each bay is an LED that lights red while charging and green when finished.I find this charger very simple to use. Just plug it into a USB A power source such as a USB A transformer brick (not included) and load it up. I have a flashlight that I like to use every day, but it runs down batteries after just an hour or so of use. So rechargeables are the only way to go with that flashlight. The light takes 3 AAA batteries, which can be rather inconvenient to charge in a small charger that only does 2 batteries at once. With this 8-bay charger, I can charge up all 3 batteries at once and then some. The first time I used the charger, I was a little confused since the AAA batteries seem to fit funny. Finally, I realized that they go on a slight slant in the charger, and that the fit is perfect. Overall, this is a handy charger to have, especially when you need to charge more than 2 batteries at once.\n",
      "Didn't realize it was USB powered I generally like EBL products, having their AC 8 battery charger and a bunch of their batteries.  So when I saw this I jumped on it, but didn't realize it was USB based, meaning you need a separate high power charger to run it.  That makes it nice to have as a spare if I need to charge a few extra batteries, but not ideal.  I certainly don't think it's as fast as the AC powered unit.  I just think it should mention USB in the item title, as I certainly don't think USB charger when dealing with AA rechargeables!\n",
      "Rethink and reads your reviews before purchasing I used this product to recharge my old batteries I had laying around the house but the charge only last about two hours or less. I recharged the same batteries three to five times each and they still wouldn't stay charged long (maybe two hours or less).\n",
      "Works so Far I have only used once so far, but it has no issues.  Hopefully it will be long lasting.  Handy to have!\n",
      "Good buy Battery charger idiot proof! Me being the idiot. The batteries so far have exceeded my expectations.\n",
      "EBL AA AAA Battery Charger - 8 Bay Individual Battery Charger, does a really fast job of charging This small-size EBL Double and Triple A battery changer does a very nice job of quickly charging Ni-MH AA AAA Rechargeable Batteries. It comes with 8 individual charging spots.It has a modern USB design that uses a USB connection to power the charger. This charger really charges batteries up fast. It has a red indicator light while charging and a green indicator light when the battery is fully charged. It is so easy to use. I really like this small charger and easily give it a 5-stars rating.\n",
      "Nice unit at a pretty nice price! Worked as described. When I loaded it with anything from 1 - 8 batteries, all charged with no issue.New EBL AA 2800mWh batteries that did not come precharged took about 2 hours to fully charge. I use a high powered USB charger (2.4A) and high quality micro USB cable to feed this unit to ensure that I don’t choke it when 8 batteries are demanding power. Near the end of the charge cycle, heat was present on the batteries. As they fully charged, l removed them from the charger to let them cool down. I suggest the same to anyone - let them cool down after charging and before usage.\n",
      "So far so good, we’ll see how long before next charging. Charges batteries in about half an hour, which was not expected. Using for solar light batteries.\n",
      "Can't charge 8 batteries at a time.  Big disappointment! I liked the idea of charging 8 batteries at once for my grandson's electronic cars but this unit doesn't do that.  Why advertise 8 slots for charging if they don't fit?  The seller really needs to amend their description as it is deceiving.\n",
      "DOA DOA. Every battery I put to charge shows error lights. Bought a Energizer charger and everything works fine\n",
      "Really fast charger I got this to replace the 4 battery chargers that came with my rechargeable batteries and it works amazing. Instead of having to take up all the outlets (old chargers were large and block a second outlet while plugged in) it uses a USB so it save space. Also, it chargers my batteries at least twice as fast now. Great buy!\n",
      "Compact Works great! Charged my batteries that weren't ebl batteries. Waiting to see how long batteries stay charged. Charger quick works as described happy!\n",
      "Fantastic Product...Works with Energizer NiMH batteries...NO AC PLUG INCLUDED I was a bit nervous how it would work given some of the reviews, but I went ahead and purchased it since it didnt cost too much and for the simple fact that it will charge batteries individually, I figured it was worth the risk.  I was extremely impressed by how well it worked.  I will give the manufacturer credit that they do specify that there is no AC plug included.  I was still a bit shocked by that, but it wasnt anything that was an issue.  I used my Aukey USB wall chager (which i also highly recommend )https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013US9FFY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1it let me know which batteries were bad as we have 3 kids and had about 20 batteries total...blinking red light = bad battery...solid red = charging.  It automatically shuts off when done and just displays green led.  I cannot speak for other NiMH battery manufacturers as I only purchased and charged Energizer brand, but it works great for them (8 at a time btw as I saw other reviews saying it wouldnt do that)  Hope this helps\n",
      "nice add on charges quick!\n",
      "Works Great This EBL AA AAA Battery Charger - 8 Bay Individual Battery Charger with 5V 2A Fast Charging Function is perfect for our needs. We use a lot of motion sensor button lights around the house, and heavily use AAA batteries. I was buying non-rechargeables for awhile, but felt bad tossing so many (recycled, but still). I got rehargeables instead, and this charger effectively powers the batteries up overnight. It might charge sooner, but I leave them in there till the next day, and they are always ready. I've seen no degradation of my batteries over the month I've used this, and am pleased with the product.\n",
      "Great charger Best battery charger I have used.\n",
      "valuable help This EBL AA AAA Battery Charger is a great help for me. Not just because it charging fast but It powered by USB and I can use it when I traveling. The third advance, it can charge every battery individually. I have a handful (for example remotes) that need just one battery.\n",
      "Works as expected This charger is very useful for me to charge batteries, it can charge 8 batteries freely at the same time, while some of other battery chargers need to charge batteries in pairs, this is not very convenient. I like this one, 8 smart individual battery charger is enough for me.\n",
      "So far, so good Successfully recharing various brands of Ni-mh batteries.  I haven't run any tests regarding charge times, but the batteries are coming out of the charger at full voltage.\n",
      "Decent charger I have used this a handful of times to charge my AA and AAA batteries. I haven’t tried more than 4 at a time. That’s because if I wait, I won’t have any charged batteries to use in my devices.The good news is that it can charge several batteries of different sizes at once. It can even charge only one at a time. My other chargers won’t do that. It has indicator lights that tell you when it is charging and indicate when it is finished.What I don’t like is that it is USB and did not come with its own USB cable.\n",
      "Standard battery charger Charges batteries quickily,can charges 8 batteries at the same time. Work as expected.\n",
      "Good for AA batteries Great little charger idea for those aa batteries that need a boost after a while. I use it to recharge my aa battery. It can also save you money,charge batteries quickily, good quality.\n",
      "Nice simple charger Simple design, 8-bay charging slots,easy and convenient to use.Great charger.\n",
      "You cannot charge 8 batteries at a time on most wall warts (not  included). Ok for travel. You cannot charge 8 batteries at a time on most wall warts (not included). This is a major, major drawback. It will if you find a 5V 2A wall wart, but those are usually for high power devices.This is ok  for travel, as it is easy to plug into a portable battery pack for charging.It  charges very slowly, so I would not choose it for home use.\n",
      "Happy with this purchase Overall this charger is great, I can charge multiple batteries with 2A input at once, smart and fast battery charger.Great buy!\n",
      "Simple and easy to charge This is a good charger for money.I've been using a different type of cheap charger for a few years, and I prefer this one. The main feature I like is the indicator light, which lets you know when the battery is fully charged.\n",
      "Charges Quick This charger is nice, the batteries fit just fine and don't pop out when you try to charge a battery.  They are individually assigned so you don't need to charge in pairs as well.  If you have a 2A USB brick, they will charge even faster, which I highly recommend.  The only thing is that I wish it came with a power brick.\n",
      "Cant charge 8 AA EBL Batteries at sametime Pretty terrible build quality. Cannot charge up to 8 batteries at once. Kind of a pointless charger if you cant use it correctly. Avoid at all costs.\n",
      "Works, but not all 8 at a time for AA I have had success charging 8 AAA and 4 AA but you cant even put 8 AA batteries in the thing without it freaking out and refusing to charge anything. They are EBL batteries too so I don't know what the deal is. I also couldn't do it like the picture and have 4AAA and 4AA. Same thing.If you do it the way it wants it charges fine though\n",
      "RECHARGEABLE love it! just laugh walking by the batteries at the dollar store now! adjusting to the fact that you just recharge them now! and not discard every time. Some of my little portable lights are brighter now than they have ever been! well worth the investment, saves money over time.\n",
      "great value i bought this for my wireless microphones. I didn't realize how fast it uses batteries...well that first usage showed me that we NEEDED this product! it is a wonderful purchase!\n",
      "Good charger! Charges batteries pretty fast!\n",
      "Marginal Quality.. Bought the 8 pack of EBL AA rechargeable batteries in May, and they have been working fine.  But today after recharging 4 pairs, 3 pairs are fine and I found 1 pair is defective....  There seems to be a lack of quality control after a certain time...\n",
      "Lights wonky? For some reason my batteries have the light remain orange on the charger no matter how long I leave them there. Think the light system is broken on mine or something.\n",
      "Fantastic battery life and longevity I've been using these for 2 years now and I could not imagine what I would have done without these batteries there is no reason not to buy this.\n",
      "battaries love them\n",
      "Works as described. Saving money already! Finely took the plunge into rechargeable batteries for our remote control cars. This charger works well. The USB ports are very helpful too.\n",
      "Xbox I've been using this charger (and the included batteries) for my wireless Xbox One controllers. The USB ports are also very useful for counter top charging, as well (i.e.: Fitbit, etc).\n",
      "1st Charger was defective, EBL promise to replace The first charger had an issue where is would not stop charging after long periods. The batteries got hot!!EBL contacted me after I reported the issue and indicated they would replace. Will update as this resolution progresses.\n",
      "Very simple to charge After leaving on the charge for several hours the LED light will turn green.  Yet the battery's are not100% charged when using a battery tester.  Left them on a few more hours and they seem to capout.  Not sure if they will last as long as a normal battery.  But I will test and find out.\n",
      "Works General use\n",
      "Charger quit working. Charger quit working after a couple of uses. Battery charges don't last as long as other brands.\n",
      "Long lasting. 2800mah per battery isn't anything to shake a stick at. I've used these batteries in my Logitech G602, I'm on my computer 6-8hrs throughout the day and I only have to swap the batteries out around once a month and a half in its performance mode which is rated for around 250 hrs. I ended up using these batteries in my TV remotes around the house, among other electronics, and it's nice to have a supply of spare batteries if you're someone that has battery operated tech laying around or if you're someone that has a lot of projects.\n",
      "nice 8 battery charger This charger is easy to use. I would like it to have an on/off button so I wouldn't have to plug and unplug. I would prefer to leave it plugged in all the time,\n",
      "Cheap, light, and don't last very long Pro:  They are cheapCon:  they don't last long.  You will run a set dead in about a week in a tv remote.  A normal battery will last about 6 months in the same remote.  They are basically useless in toys.  You spend more time putting them in than the kid plays with the toy.\n",
      "Good product good price Good product good price\n",
      "Worked well Worked well\n",
      "Batteries die quickly I kept forgetting to return these.  They die soooo fast and they take so long to charge.  Wish I didn't buy them and spent a little more on something better.\n",
      "batteries would not charge a second time I charged the batteries once. They were good for a very short period of time (about 3 hours of use in a device that usually lasts for 48 hours of use with regular batteries.  I tried charging the batteries again, but they wouldn't charge.  the light stayed red overnight.  I have other rechargeable batteries that charged up in the EBL charger; so, their batteries are clearly rubbish.  I would caution against buying this product.  There are better ones out there.\n",
      "Long lasting battery Works great long lasting and came charged up.\n",
      "The Charging UNIT only lasted 1 year This is awful!  The unit for the batteries to be charged in only lasted a year... The batteries out lasted it.  I would definitely try another product... ON TOP OF THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTACT THE SELLER TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO GET YOUR COMPLAINT HANDLED!  DON'T BUY THESE!\n",
      "Blew up on first use. Do not buy. Waste of money. Used the charger one time. It shorted out and  smoked all of the batteries. Return window had already closed because the existing Arli batteries lasted over 6 mins before we had to charge and use the new ones. Would not buy this product ever again.\n",
      "great charger Like the fact that you can charge both AAA and AA at same time.\n",
      "Not working! I bought this charger half year ago but haven't used it until last week because my old one still works. However, I tried both AAA and AA batteries and found out the LED indicator/charger didn't  work at all. The green lights were always on that I couldn't tell whether it was working or not. After I left batteries plugged in for over 6 hours, I tried them on but none of them has power at all. I had to switch back to my old charger. And by the way, I tried different brands of rechargeable batteries - Amazon basic, EBL and Panasonic, none of them worked.\n",

      "these batteries stronk these batteries stronk af, with my old rechargeables i would have to change batteries in my xbox one controller at least once every 1-2 days. Now i dont need to change batteries for atleast 4-5 days, and I GOT 8 OF EM. THATS 20 DAYS OF STR8 GAMING BOYS.\n",
      "love it Awesome product a definite must have!\n",
      "Decent rechargeable batteries Use them for my Roku Ultra remote. Before when I was using regular disposable Duracells & I would go through the batteries within 3 to 4 days. These last a little over a week before they hit the 10% mark in my Roku Ultra remote. They take a few hours to charge up. They did not come fully pre-charged so it took a while to charge them. A small flaw I noticed was after fully charging the batteries & took them off the charger to put them away in storage & tried them they were at 52%. They appear to loose charge even when idle & not hooked up to anything. So it looks like you gotta keep them on the charger & the charger plugged in at all times if you want fully charged batteries.Also, the green fully charged indicator light is flawed. It doesn't indicate a full charge at 100%, just when it hits at around 70 to 75% making it nearly impossible to determine if the batteries are fully charged to 100%. I can determine this through my Roku remote in settings where it shows battery percentage but most other AA/AAA powered devices don't have this luxury. Other than these flaws I’m glad I went with these instead of the Energizer rechargables. Decent for the price I guess.\n",
      "Usb Good charger\n",
      "Gnat-like lifespan I installed motion-activated LED lights in my kitchen.  I was using regular (disposable?) AA batteries in the lights.  The regular AA batteries would last about three weeks.  I bought these thinking I'd be able to save on the hassle and waste of the regular AAs.  I thought these would last a comparable amount of time to the regular AAs.  They don't.  I'm changing batteries every 3-days.  They're nowhere near the power/life of the regular AAs.  The charger is well designed (it doesn't beep like in their videos).  I'm going to relegate these to remote control duty and search for an alternative.\n",

      "I’d recommend My first order wasn’t working properly in my experience and I contacted the customer service. They have been really awesome about it and sent the replacement which is much better. Charging time is around 15-18 hours after you drain a battery completely which is fine unless you need them all at same time for different electronics items. I have been using these in Xbox controller and they last a good time with few hours playtime everyday.\n",

If you can wait all day for a charge then you are good to go.As you can see by my garage door app on my phone, these batteries are fresh today and already have to change them again. Sad batteries thats for sure!The batteries are trash, very light in weight. These batteries only open my garage door 4 times, then dead. Vs energizer 200 open closes. So batteries are just no good.Come to think about it, Why did I not return this already?\n",

      "Good brand, good batteries I use these same batteries at my work for DSLR Flash units and they pack way more punch compared to the other brands we tried. They took a little longer to charge than I was expecting but assume they must have been pretty dead to begin with. Took a few hours of charging to get all 8 full again.\n",
      "Easy peasy Works great thinking about getting my kids one....maybe lol\n",
      "TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!! **Edit - My original review is below the line. I've updated my rating to 3 stars because the seller stands behind their products & issued a full refund after we discussed the issues. Based on their service, I guess it's possible I may have gotten a couple bad sets. I don't think I'll be trying them again but, if you decide to, at least you know the seller will address any issues promptly & work with you to make it right, unlike so many others these days. That's worth a couple stars in my book.-----I wish I could leave NO stars! I guess the the charger itself make qualify for the ONE star. It appears well made & is easy to use. It lights up with red or green status lights to show battery levels, & batteries charged in it test as full upon removal..BUT, the included batteries are ABSOLUTE JUNK! >:(I even bought the big case of batteries made by this company at the same time & have ONLY used their charger for them but they're worthless too.They register as charged but just CANNOT hold a charge!  They're useless!They claim they'll work for high demand devices but just my programmable thermostat kept registering low battery after less than a day when I switched to these batteries.After months of dealing with what I assumed to be a faulty thermostat, I actually had it replaced.It never occurred to me, based on the great reviews & seller claims, that EVERY ONE of the batteries in this package, as well as the many batteries that came with their case, could be ALL be bad.THEY ARE! >:(I replaced the thermostat yet STILL had the same problem!!!A store run just for batteries isn't exactly a great idea right now, so I resorted to using my old rechargables (made by a different company) a few days ago. They'd been sitting in my camera for almost a year yet they worked fine! It's been 3 days & not a single low battery notice or issue -  with used batteries that sat in a camera, maintaining its picture count, etc. for almost year!  Yet these brand new batteries couldn't manage to power it for a full 24 hours - usually not even 12 hours!!I'm happy that I know the REAL problem has been these horrible batteries, but also VERY angry! >:(I bought this charger & their case with batteries less than 7 months ago!I followed their instructions. I charged them all with ONLY the charger made for them. I've properly stored them in their case since. I did everything right here, yet they still just don't work!They SHOULD have at least some charge left to them, especially the triple As & others that haven't been used at all or had only been charged one additional time. NOPE!! >:(I just tested them ALL & EVERY SINGLE ONE, from this set & the case set, is completely drained!Don't waste your money if you want batteries that actually work!!\n",
      "3 days and counting! Been playing with some cheap RC cars with my son due to the lock-down and the space in our rooftop won't allow us to play with faster cars. playing around 2 hrs a day for 3 days now, battery still going strong. Bear in mind these toys are power hungry, each car uses 5 AA batteries.\n",
      "These batteries just don’t hold a charge! These batteries will drain even with no use over the period of a couple of days! I will never buy the EBL brand again. I purchased them on two separate occasions, thought the first was a bad batch, apparently not. Save your money, buy another brand!!!The charger with It is ok, though a little slow.EDIT:08-07-20 The manufacturer recommended to charge and discharge these batteries 3 times to build their capacity, so I went out and bought the BT-C2400 Battery Charger / Analyzer, great device btw. I followed the manufacturers instructions and went through the discharge refresh cycle on the analyzer. The mAh on these batteries was rated at 2800, the highest I got was 2135 on one out of 12 batteries, most were around half of rated value. Once again after 4 weeks on the shelf I got values from .29v to 1.27v. These batteries are absolutely USELESS. RUN from these EBT batteries. DO NOT waste your money. Also I had commented that the charger wasn’t so bad, well after getting a real charger I realize just how bad the provided charger was. It’s as bad as the batteries. The seller sent me replacement batteries in case the ones I had were defective, which was a wonderful thing to do, but those were just as bad. Quite frankly The Amazon Bacics rechargeables are a much better battery and therefore a much better buy. Thanks for the support EBT but this product is not up to quality standards set by other foreign brands.\n",
      "great deal I bought two of these at Christmas for both my kids. The batteries last a long time and are still working great\n",

      "Long charge time but overall good battery life I use a pump and have to use batteries for it to be portable, I was going through so many batteries until I bought these rechargeable ones and now I’m saving so much money. Only down fall I really have is how long it takes to charge them but I’ll plug them in when I go to bed for the night.\n",
      "Is this a joke? Wrong power cord dent This was sent to me with the wrong power cord. I like jokes, but the irony of that is a bit much.  It would not fit and thus won't power up to recharge the batteries.  So I can't tell you how well the batteries work or last.  Perhaps they should have made a better effort in providing the right parts for this to properly and fully function.  Would not recommend at all\n",

      "Works, but came with a glitch One of the lights does not function properly.  It is always amber, unlike the ones that work correctly turning from green to amber then back to green once charged.

This brand was at the bottom of the list for nearly every test.*UPDATE*  The seller contacted me regarding this review. The seller offered, then sent a full refund even tho it is past return window, and did not request sent product back. Seller is awesome. Hopefully seller will communicate my concerns / suggestions to manufacturer.\n",
      "Didn’t hold charge for very long but decent customer service These did not hold a charge very long at all. I use it for my breast pump so I didn’t have to go through batteries so quickly. And it wouldn’t last me a whole days worth of pumping (lasted about 2-3 pumps). It didn’t seem worth it to me, and it didn’t seem to pump as strong as typical batteries.*UPDATE: I have received CONSTANT emails from this company regarding my previous 2 star review. I am giving them 4 stars because they were at least trying to make it right by giving me a new one or giving me a refund. Today’s email from Joseph Huang is asking that I change my review rating, so here we are...\n",

      "Great price Easy to use, fast long lasting charge.\n",
      "Great at first, but slowly dwindled. After having these batteries for a few years now, I can say that they aren't the best. At first when I got them they seemed fine, but after only a couple months I found some of the batteries had swollen so much that they'd no longer fit in my lights. I'd have to use pliers to remove the batteries from stuff, so I'd have to throw those ones away. The ones that didn't swell just don't really hold a charge anymore. I can  charge them, have green lights, and then use them and they die in a matter of minutes. The company reached out to me to offer a replacement a couple years back which was awesome, but in order to get the replacement I had to send in all the batteries which I couldn't do since I had thrown some away. They were cheap, and they got the job done for the most part over the years, but now they are practically worthless and I'm looking for other brands to replace them with.\n",

      "Worked once. Then wouldn’t charge batteries ever again Welp I used this once and it worked great. And that’s it. Now it won’t charge batteries at all. Yes the positive and the negative are facing the right direction. Yes I’m charging 2 at a time. No they never charge back up. Put the batteries in a different brand charger (after 8hrs on the EBL charger they still had very little charge) and they charged up fine.I bought this in Dec. it’s feb. I got one use out of it only. Now I’m stuck with a dead device. Wish I could get my money back.\n",

      "FAKE REVIEWS on this BOGUS trash rechargeable battery...DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK LONG STORY SHORT, I bought these for a photo shoot, after fully charging them all the night before, they lost 10-15% of their charge in less than 12 hours of non-use.  less than 2 hours into using them for 3 camera flashes, they were dead.THANKFULLY I HAD BACK ALKALINE BATTERIES that lasted over 3 hours and are still powering my flashes.  THESE ARE TRASH JUNK CRAP!!! they lie about 2800mah... not even close. and the inability to hold a charge is ridiculous. amazon sent me another set just incase these were defective and NOPE JUNK JUNK JUNK same issues. after fully charged. 6 hours later I put them on a different charger that gave charge-levels and 6 hours later they lost a full bar out of 4 and needed to sit on the charger for 30 mins before going back to 4 bars.WHY IS AMAZON ALLOWING THIS TRASH TO BE SOLD AND WHY ARE THERE SO MANY 5 STAR POSITIVE REVIEWS!!! THIS IS ALL FAKE REVIEW DRIVEN CRAP... DO NOT BUY THESE!!!\n",
      "Great batteries comparable to Eneloop; charger is iffy The batteries work great, my problem is the charger. It seems to charge batteries fine but the indicator lights are always green. If I put the batteries in dead the corresponding light remains solid green. As a result I have to let them charge overnight to be sure they're full. An annoyance but they do work great.EDIT- Yesterday I charged batteries again with the charger and it appears that the indicator lights worked as they should, red-orange at first then green a few hours later, the batteries charged. J don't know why the first time it didn't work yet now it does. I'll need to test it further, but I'm going up to 5 stars since it seems to be working now. (The company also reached out to me-good customer service. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again)Last review- again the charger isn't working. I put 2 batteries in it last night. 16+ hours later the indicator light is still red. I'm not convinced that the charger works as it should if at all. The batteries themselves seem to work great\n",

      "Don't hold charge, and don't deliver rated capacity. I've bought a variety of rechargeable batteries from Amazon.  Most work fairly well, and deliver pretty much their rated capacity.  The three Amazon branded varieties work well with the Blacks working the best.  Of all the batteries I've purchased the EBL's have been terrible performers.  They rarely deliver the rated capacity even from the day of first charge.  They don't hold a charge when sitting in a drawer for very long.  After 30 days after a full charge they drop to half capacity and in most cases won't light a flashlight they've been put in.  After one year of use (about 20 charges) they  only deliver about 60%  of the downrated capacity they had from day one.  I should have noted the country of origin.  They are made in China and based on performance I guess I shouldn't be surprised.  All the rechargeables I've purchased those that were made in Japan work great, deliver their rated capacity, hold a charge sitting in a drawer for three times as long as any EBL battery and continue to deliver 95/97 % of rated capacity after one year.  For those that are curious I use a MH-C9000 Powerex WizardONe charger-analyzer to charge the my batteries, check their capacities and use the refresh mode every ten or so usage cycles to bring them back to maximum capacity.  I just purchased my 2nd MH-C9000 charger as a gift for my DIY brother and he is also thrilled with the unit.\n",
      "I am satisfied Purchased for the kids controllers, now they always have fresh batteries. I am happy\n",
      "Battery diameter is too large.  (Updated review below) The batteries are slightly larger in diameter than normal AAs. So, they would not seat properly in my appliance. When batteries are in sequence they rely on the spring at the negative terminal to keep them connected.  I had no such problem with the Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries. However the charger works very well.UPDATE:The Seller promptly contacted me and explained that the extra capacity (2800) required a slightly larger battery diameter.  They solved the problem by sending a set of 2300 batteries that fit perfectly.  I am happy.  I changed the rating from 2 to 5 stars.\n",

      "Batteries are slightly larger than standard AA EDIT:  I have used the batteries in other products - some were a bit snug but just as I expected they worked fine.  They may not work for small products that may have tight battery areas.  I will point out that the company has contacted me twice about this.  I assured them the first time that I was happy with the product overall and was sure I could use them elsewhere.  However they contacted me again to offer me a full refund or a replacement.  I wrote them back and told them I wanted neither as I can use the batteries, as they are for other products just fine, and certainly did not feel I need to be compensated for such a minor issue.I updated this review from a 3-star (I did not know it was a 3 star I thought it was a 4) to a 5 as I am very happy with the product.  I hope this will let them know that :).I hope this helps future, prospective purchasers.The batteries will probably work well with many products, however, the one we bought them for they do not.  My wife has a globe that uses three AA batteries to throw the \"snow stuff\" around.  It eats batteries fairly fast.  Unfortunately, these batteries had to be pushed very hard to fit.  In so doing they do not move at all in the holder.  So the spring cannot push them up to make good contact.  I had to go buy regular batteries anyway.\n",

      "(2800Ah Ni-MH AA) EXCELLENT We've bought some other EBL sized re-chargeable batteries and these seem to be great value for the $$$. I can't attest to how many times they'll charge up before no longer able to do so, but after even 3 or 4 times they've already paid for themselves several times over, and if we only get a year's worth of charging this was well worth it. Should they suffer an ill-timed death, I'll update this review.\n",
      "Disappointing This charger only charges batteries in pairs, and doesn't fully charge the batteries (whether the included batteries or eneloops) compared to Panasonic chargers.  The batteries also discharge quickly when not in use, compared to eneloop batteries.  i don't usually return items this expensive when there are issues but I am this time.\n",
      "Lower Battery Cost in the Long Run, and Won't Leak and Ruin Devices I have purchased EBL batteries and chargers in the past and have no regrets about the purchases. The costs of the batteries and charger are reasonable, and the products work well. I have elected to convert to NiMh batteries wherever possible, and have purchased adapters for using AA batteries for C and D size applicatons. In the long run, battery cost will be greatly reduced and NiMh batteries don't leak and corrode like alkaline batteries which can and have ruined battery powered devices.\n",
      "Bought three and buying MORE! I freaking LOVE these chargers. I have push lights in my micro kitchen, lights lining my fence outside, and currently, my Christmas tree. The batteries last forever. I could get a couple of weeks on the lights for the kitchen with a standard AA battery, but with the rechargeables, I get more than a month. They are remarkably long-lasting. From drained to fully charged, it takes a couple of hours. I'm going to buy another set for my Apple keyboard and mouse because everyone knows that the batteries in those two die in zero time and it's really, really annoying... Highly recommend. I will not buy disposables anymore.\n",

      "Great for Flash Photography I was really impressed by the quality of the batteries, as well as the charger. I am a nightclub and event photographer and use lots of batteries for my flash. One set of four batteries lasted in my Canon 470RT flash on ETTL for a full 2 and a half hours. I noticed once or twice having to turn off and back on because of how high drain the flash is. I know this because I sat and fired 50+ full 1/1 flashes when I first got the batteries and it never had to “charge” the flash. So when IT said “charging” after shooting for five minutes I just turned off and on it went straight back to firing no problem.The box it came in is somewhat vacant of information. And the instructions were written in broken English. But no complaints! The batteries do NOT get hot when they charge as others have said.Really great deal. So far it’s been a high quality product and great purchase in my book.\n",

      "So many charged batteries I've got a ton of flashlights that I use pretty much nightly. In the past, I had to play battery shuffle constantly. If I ended up having some terrible night at work and burning through all my batteries, I'd have to consciously cycle batteries through the day to make sure everything was charged up for work. This charger keeps more than enough AAs charged up and ready. I've had it a few months and its charged over 100 batteries. So far it's been a good purchase.\n",
      "Long lasting. Bought them for our 2 way radios for our RV while backing up.\n",
      "I think I got a lemon... UPDATE:After posting my review, the company immediately contacted me and sent me a replacement charger and batteries. After charging for about 5 hours, all of the lights turned green. Seems as though my first charger was defective. Excellent customer service!Original review:I’ve used these batteries in timer candles I have on the wall and they have died 3 times in the last month. I think I may have a lemon because the reviews I’ve read say the charger should change from red to green when they’re done charging in about 4 hours and I’ve left mine plugged in overnight and it’s still been red. Would return but I’m 2 days outside of my return period. Hoping the company sends me a replacement.\n",
      "5⭐️ Just what I expected, would buy again\n",
      "Very low on juice Garbage. A full charge last only a few days on a KEYBOARD !\n",
      "Leaks First one I used leaked inside my electronic device\n",
      "Great value! Will never buy another battery again... this is perfect for homes with electronic deadbolts and wireless thermostats.... they drain batteries so fast and this allows me to always have powers ready to go.  Just plug and play!  Great value!\n",
      "Doesn't hold a charge. I bought this for my breast pump. It works great for maybe one pumping session which is about 20 minutes. Very unsatisfied.\n",
      "Gracias Gracias\n",

      "Working for what I was wanting them for - BOSS ME-80 I was hesitant to get these after reading that they did not fit some applications but decided to take a chance. I am very glad I did! I am using them in a BOSS ME-80 Guitar Multi Effects unit. So far, they have been powering it for a little over 5 hours and they are still going strong. They do fit perfectly! I can take this to a friend's house or church and not have to worry about using a power supply.I am very happy with this purchase. Very glad I took a chance on them!UPDATE: They have been powering the ME-80 for NINE hours now on the first charge!!! Super pumped about this!UPDATE 2: These batteries powered the Boss ME-80 for 20 hours!!! I am amazed! The batteries have now been on the charger for about 12 hours. I will see how long it takes for them to fully charge. If they do charge correctly, I will be ordering 12 more batteries as the ME-80 uses 6 batteries for power. I do have a power adapter for it but would rather run on the batteries for the convenience.\n",

      "Wonderful charger It charges not only AA batteries but also AAA batteries, there are also two USB ports that can be used simultaneously when charging your batteries. The charger comes with 8-AA batteries that were not charged, so I charged them, it took about 1 hr 45 minutes to completely charge.  It also comes with a cord and an instruction booklet that is very easy to read and understand and is in 5 different languages .  When charging if the  your battery is not charged the led lights above the battery will show red and when fully charged will show green.  There are 4 led lights, one light for two batteries, when charging use the same size batteries under each light.  The size of the unit is 7.5 inches length, 3.8 inches width and 1,2 inches height,  and it weighs 6 ounces.  Since I have charged the batteries I have been using them in an old cd player and they are awesome been playing for 5 hours non-stop and they are still going strong. The batteries come in little case that snap shut which I love no more batteries all over the drawer.  These batteries are  ProCyco technology - EBL batteries can be recharged up to 1200 times when fully or partially drained,  Improved low self discharge makes it still maintain 80% of capacity after 3 year of non-use.  Batteries come pre-charged and can be used immediately out of the package but mine wasn't charged but that was no big deal since I got the charger.  You can use these batteries in household devices such as digital cameras, toys, remote controls, hand held games, flashlights ,alarm-clocks, portable audio players and any other item that uses AA or AAA batteries.I highly recommend this product it is very high quality and if you have any problems they tell you to contact them and give a URL to reach them in the instruction booklet.\n",
      "So Far So Good I've been using this for a little over a month now. So far the batteries have been great and I love the extra USB ports on the charger. Perfect for phones, tablets etc.\n",
      "also charged my other rechargable batteries Easy to use - just plug in and put the batteries in for charging.  Lights are helpful to indicate a fully charged battery.  One thing I didnt realize - you have to charge the batteries in sets of two (2).  Still fantastic for all my wireless things!\n",
      "Rechargeable should be the default way... Works great and the USB ports are an excellent addition.\n",
      "As advertised. Batteries hold charge well. I bought EBL chargers and EBL batteries for a 2 week trip to Disney World and Southern Florida. I charged all the batteries before the trip. When ready to use them they didn't require \"topping off\" because they held the charge well. They also performed comparable to Alkalines. I wish I bought them years ago because I use 8 alkalines for each of the 3 grandson hockey games. These will now be my battery of choice.\n",
      "batteries are not very good the batteries stink\n",
      "Good product Very good charger\n",
      "Long lasting Put these in my trail Cam and last for months\n",
      "Rechargeable Battery Station This is super cool. Not only do you get a rechargeable battery station, but you get 8 rechargeable batteries with it. Not only that, the battery station has 2 USB ports to charge your stuff with. So freaking awesome. We are already using some of the batteries. I like that you can charge AA or AAA batteries with this.I did read where it says don't mix battery sizes in one indicator section...so keep that in mind. I'm looking forward to saving a lot of money on batteries.I also like that the batteries come in a thick and sturdy container.\n",
      "Good value Easy to set up and use\n",
      "They work They work\n",
      "Good value for the money Using these batteries for a trail camera. I like the charging station. So far, so good. Since the batteries are included this product is a good value for the price.\n",
      "Works great Charges fast\n",
      "Buena inversion. Es una buena inversion comprar este cargador para 8 baterias AA junto con las baterias recargables.\n",
      "Power all the time Cant beat the price for these rechargeable batteries and they arrived with quick shipping!\n",
      "Charger I love this product but don’t like I have used 2 or pairs to charge. I have products that only that one battery\n",
      "Best value for smart charger Great product\n",
      "Great Batteries last a long time.\n",
      "muy buena good\n",
      "Great batteries for the price! They work exactly as described. Feels as though they take a while to charge, I assume due to the cycling? Not sure.\n",
      "Good product but battles are a little bigger than standard AA Good batteries and charger.  The batteries are very slightly bigger in circumference than standard AA batteries so if what you are putting them in doesn’t have a little “extra” space between the batteries these might not fit.\n",
      "A good high capacity rechargeable battery If you need a high capacity battery for things like cameras and flashes these are good products.  These batteries are 2800 mAh which give you a lot of reserve power.  I have bought several sets an I am pleased with them.  The chargers are also very good for the price.\n",
      "Not good Not so good\n",
      "Excelente Buy buena calidad de producto. muy recomendable\n",
      "Love it Everything is just like in the description.\n",
      "This is what every parent or grandparent needs. I purchased this one as we have 5 grandchildren and trying to keep them in batteries is almost impossible. When we got these it was with the understanding that if they need new batteries they have to give us the old batteries first so we can recharge them. This has been a grandparents dream.\n",
      "I'm pleased These are holding up very well in my VR hand controllers, it kills batteries fast so I cant give a true longevity review but I have 8 batteries and I only need 4 at a time so switching them out for freshly charged batteries is no problem at all\n",
      "Works well. I go through a lot of batteries so I thought I’d try a charger. Came with 8 batteries. Works well and the batteries have a strong charge when finished.\n",
      "Respecto Muy  buenas ya e comprado 2 veces este producto en éste me resulta muy satisfactorio me dura más de dos años lo recomiendo lo uso casi a diario en la iglesia\n",
      "Great for gaming Bought for xbox one x controllers. This is a life saver. Great long lasting batteries.\n",
      "Highly advised Works great! Charger is reliable and fast.\n",
      "works great charges great\n",
      "So far so good. Will update as these age. Just got today. Will try to update as I go. Bought these and some battery adapters (C&D) for all my uses around the home. Manuals have typical Chinese bad grammar but the charger feels and looks solid. The batteries like just feel like they're high quality. The box had something marked our with sharpie and my curiosity got the best of me so I used some rubbing alcohol to clean it off. Apparently they have a model that can do 220v or they had that in mind when printing the box but this is not it. This unit only does 120v. So I cannot travel with it without an international transformer.\n",
      "Working great for the wireless musician. I use these for my wireless guitar transmitter and my in ear monitor body pack.  Since each uses batteries in pairs this works perfectly to rotate batteries.  It charges my Panasonic Eneloop AA batteries very well in addition to the EBL's that came with it.\n",
      "Good product. Use these in work flashlight.  Batteries last for 4 days.\n",
      "Well built charger. Bought this charger with the 8 EBL 2800mAh batteries. Initial charge with all 8 batteries took about 6-8 hours to charge. After first charge, only takes about 4-5 hours. Charger feels well built, 2 usb ports work great. Batteries are easy to remove and install. Will but this one again! Fast delivery!\n",
      "Good charger Good charger but it can only charge batteries in pairs, single battery can not be charged.\n",
      "A good value This appears to be a quality battery charger for the price.\n",
      "Reliable products Excellent products great prices with reliable service do recommend will use again\n",
      "Outanding product Excelente product, good price\n",
      "Good purchase Great product.\n",
      "Great Rechargeable batteries Tired of continuing to buy batteries that don't last well this is a phenomenal set of rechargeable batteries that I highly recommend.\n",
      "So far so good! The batteries and charger are working great so far. The batteries feel heavier than normal for AA and I'm not sure if that's good or bad, but they work as advertised.\n",
      "short battery life got this on the 15th, charged up AA batteries overnight to ensure full charge. Put two in my MAC trackpad and now 10 days later I get low battery warning. I put another set in that was fully charged and and have been sitting in the box for the last 10 days and they are registering only 83% charged.  Very disappointed.  I got these because i was tired of replacing the name brand copper top batteries every couple months.  These have to be replaced and recharged every two weeks for this device?  Nope, I dont recommend them based on that.  I dont know how many times they can really be recharged and how degraded the performance will be as time goes on.update 4/3/2018(one week later) the batteries in my trackpad are now at 17%.  mind you this is a very low consumption device and these batteries have lost 70% of their charge in just one week.  By comparison, my keyboard has copper-tops in it which have been in there for about 6 weeks and still show 100% charge.\n",
      "Works flawlessly. Got this so I can recharge my soap dispenser batteries. Took about six hours to charge. Works for me, batteries are in for about a week and working just fine.\n",
      "Worked okay for a while but then... Constantly flashes on and off when using the usb charger.The battery charge indicator lights stay on even when no batteries are in the ports\n",
      "Great Haven't charged yet, will when I get to Canada. Needed for grandkids\n",
      "EBL Rechargable batteries Got these to use in a trail camera.  The work well and seem to last.  Initial charge took several hours.\n",
      "Good value Delivered on-time, good price.  Time will tell how batteries perform over time but history with ELB bats tell me it should be good.\n",
      "critical diameter The batteries are .011\" larger in diameter (even if you remove the plastic over-wrap) than standard AA batteries. I have a tool that has a critical diameter to fit. The batteries are too large. If you have an application where the battery diameter is critical you will want to consider this.The diameter is .563\" vs. .553\" , typical diameter of 2 different brand name AA batteries.\n",
      "Nice battery charger GreAt product, quick ship, Nice battery charger, will be using it primarily for my Xbox One controller.\n",
      "EBL 2800mAh Ni-MH AA Rechargeable Batteries (8 Pack) and 808U AA AAA Battery Charger with 2 USB Port Great price! Had a chance to use the batteries and they work well! Excellent product!\n",
      "Will never buy regular throw away batteries again I will never waste the money on regular batteries again. The technology of the new batteries has arrived. The charger does good does not get hot and charges my phone and other items very quick with the USB ports. It sits on my desk and have put away my iPhone plug in style. Just plug it into the charger and go! Batteries are maybe a 1/6th or 32 nd larger but so far have fit everything.\n",
      "Not high power Not as good as i thought.\n",
      "Works great Use these for my Xbox one controllers. Like that they hold a good charge, don't take long to charge, and I can obviously use them for a lot of other purposes.Really like the touch of the storage cases - helps keep things organized.\n",
      "SAY \"GOODBYE\" TO THOSE \"ALKALINE\" BATTERIES FOREVER!!! I \"LOVE\" THE \"QUALITY\" AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL. YOUR  BATTERIES AND CHARGERS\"NEVER\" OVERHEAT! YOUR BATTERIES HOLD A CHARGE REALLY WELL. WHOEVER THOUGHTOF PUTTING THE TWO \"USB PORTS\" FOR CHARGING ALL OF THE \"DEVICE'S WE ALLHAVE THESE DAYS. GIVE THE \"BRAINS\" WHO ENGINEERED THIS CHARGER AND BATTERIES.\n",
      "Great batteries. Using these with camera and they seem pretty darn good so far. Charger is a bit slow but does its job.\n",
      "Great quality My son loves this. Bought this for his game controllers\n",
      "fair does not fit all batteries\n",
      "Online description is wrong The online description of this charger says the input voltage is 100-240 V, 50/60Hz. The label on the charger says the input voltage is 100-120 V, 60Hz. I travel internationally and bought it specifically because it appeared that it could be used in North America as well as in Europe, Asia, etc. I'll have to return it.Update (2/14/201): The vendor changed the description to say that the charger operates on 100-120V, which is correct. However, as of today the description still says the charger is for \"worldwide\" use. This is wrong. Many (most?) countries operate on 220-240V. These guys still can't get their story straight.\n",
      "received on time received on time, so far so good\n",
      "Save lot's of money I don't know why I never purchased this along time ago. helps you save money and the environment. It's quick and easy and is made solidly. Highly recommended.\n",
      "Battery life is amazing. 8 AA batteries included Best charger yet. I'm so impressed as to how much life I'm receiving on all of my included batteries. It takes a while to charge from scratch  however. Maybe 12 hours or more, but last 3 times longer than Duracell alkaline. Using in my Xbox controller.\n",
      "Great charger and very flexible Works well for charging from one to 8 batteries. Much better than my old charger, and flexible enough to do AA or AAA batteries (or a combination).\n",
      "Buy it!!! Awesome batteries! The double AA are incredible. I use them in my xbox remote and havent charged them for over a week. I also use a Scott seed spreader 5 days a week for a total of around 1-2 hours per day and havent charged that in over a week either. It is worth the money.\n",
      "Works perfect As described\n",
      "Works as it should I bought two of these guys I don’t have to buy batteries anymore and it comes with batteries included\n",
      "Perfect charger Does exactly what we need it to do, charge batteries.\n",
      "Gamer must have! Haven't heard my son complain about it yet... .so ..it must be working for him.\n",
      "Awesome product Charger is awesome looking and works great\n",
      "I needed this Perfect for the holidays\n",
      "Convenient combination. Needed rechargeable batteries with long life.  These did the trick.\n",
      "Cheap It took almost 8 hours to charge AA batteries. The  indicator lights kind of flicker between orange and green so you dont know if its truly charged. Built very cheaply.\n",
      "They are long lasting love it! I bought these rechargeable batteries set for my son for his xbox and they are awesome. He don’t play much so one set last him such a long time that I use the rest for my tv remotes. The are highly recommended.\n",
      "So far so good! I bought these rechargeable batteries and the charger because my Bluetooth mouse was eating batteries.  Then when I started thinking about it, I realized that remotes and a couple of battery-operated clocks in my house could use rechargeables also.  All is going well so far!  My mouse is happy with the AA batteries included.\n",
      "Great charger and batteries This charger and batteries are of high quality. I do like the fact that the charger has 2 USB charger ports. I highly recommend this product to others.\n",
      "I have 14 of these chargers. I use this charger on a daily basis. I have over 400 batteries that I have to keep charged for my trail cameras. The charger works well.\n",
      "Everything you'd expect. Bought this charger as I had a group of about 30 mixed brand rechargeable batteries (from Energizer to Eneloop to AmazonBasics). The charger went through and charged all of them without a single complaint. The included batteries seem to hold their own with all of my other batteries, as well.\n",
      "Save bucks and use rechargeable batteries I purchased this for use in our Church AV minastery. We generally use 2-4 As Batteries each service in our wireless mics. Previously they were using non rechargeable batteries. Because we wanted to be sure of batteries going deaf mid service the used ones got trashed each week.Now we have a ready supply of great quality recharged batteries each week.Good value product\n",
      "Quickly charges Works great- just as advertised.\n",
      "Durable charger and batteries I love my new rechargable batteries bought them and charger since I had bought a toy that required 24 batteries! So charging them at 4 at a time, would take just too long, this one helps as it charges double the amount. The batteries hold good charge. they have a light weight and hold good charge. I like the fact that you can charge AA and AAA batteries at the same time .Thanks\n",
      "Long lAsting Sofar  so Good the first charge was over nite but since then the charge time was a few hours and the charge in my house phones lasts a few days. (3 or 4)\n",
      "Missing piece Did not come with power cord\n",
      "Better for the environment The first time charging I kept the batteries charging for additional 2 hours after they were fully charged, a trick I read online that will maintain your battery capacity. Not sure if it works but it’s worth a try. My body fat scale goes through triple A batteries almost every other month so I bought these rechargeable ones hoping to cut down the cost and do so good to the environment\n",
      "Worth it for roku ultra owners! I use roku ultra's private listening a lot and that became expensive with AA batteries. I also needed some AAA so thats why I got the 4+4 pack. I was fully expecting to need to swap them out every other day but to my surprise one charge lasted me almost 2 weeks! The charge time isn't instant but it really wasn't that long. All batteries were charged within maybe 8 hours (can't remember) on the 1st charge. Overall I'm very pleased so far and will update my review if anything changes.\n",
      "It works very well! I got this battery charger mainly because it had a digital read out that tells you the status of your battery. It works very well, plus it takes AA and AAA sizes of batteries.\n",
      "AA x 4 not charging AA x 4 are not holding a charge. I have charged all the batteries as instructed prior to initial use but only the AAA x 4 batteries are working.  I’m happy that the charger can be used for AA/AAA the same time though.\n",
      "Must have Great charger, fast and reliable.\n",
      "Defective batteries I'm sorry for myself to buy such a thing, two of four aaa batteries became defective after the first charging\n",
      "Useful Its good for family to use，and will help save money.\n",
      "Convenient Exactly as described\n",
      "Fantastic Love love love there is nothing negative i can say about this\n",
      "It works but slight flaw in design Only potential problem ir drawback is that the USB plugs don't fully insert into the charging ports. This leaves metal edges exposed to electrical contact!\n",
      "Powerowl battery charger I like it so far think it should come with a wall plug. I am glad my phone charger plug works\n",
      "Works fine Works as described\n",
      "Great recharging technology I was hesitant at first to try it since I have tried of the rechargeable batteries that do not work well. I have to say the technology at this time is much better and the battery life is really very good, as good as a regular battery would be.\n",
      "Nice charger and batteries so far Only had a little while so hasn't been fully through paces. Nice setup though. As advertised.\n",
      "I might start using rechargeable batteries for other uses now. Charges quickly. Still waiting to see how long the charge lasts. I used it on my solaraccent lights.\n",
      "The search was well worth it. A huge reason i gave it 5 stars is the fact that you have 2 types of battiers in one kit. 4 of AA and 4 AAA. I can use it for my sons xbox and Tv Remote control. The color of the batteries makes it easy to tell the differnce when recharging them.\n",
      "Bad design Poorly designed charging system for charging low self-discharge batteries. It charges each circuit for just over a second at about 2.18 Amps, which causes heating and is improper for these batteries...\n",
      "It charged 8 batteries within a couple of hours. I purchased this rechargeable batteries for my electronic toothbrush and it come with a eight bay smart charger, it runs on aa batteries and its nice, when the battery is fully charged, it will automatically stop charging. The batteries are lasting so far very well. I it charges my batteries soon. I was throwing them away, now I can charge even stubborn rechargable batteries ! wonderful idea being round too. I bought a second one so I will always have charged batteries.\n",
      "worth the buy. Love the rechargeable batteries. Long lasting. Charge up real fast.\n",
      "Works great and the batteries are really strong Works great and the batteries are super powerful. My milk frother can turn heavy cream into whipped cream now lol\n",
      "Meh, works but doesn't seem like 2800mAh. Seems the same as my 2 year old eneloop and Amazon basics 1900mAh rechargeables.  Used in gaming console controllers.  Heavy use daily. Recharged often.  Can't say for longetivity, but average use per charge.Charger isn't that smart. Take a fresh charged battery out and put it back in and it \"charges\" again.\n",
      "need recharge good to have\n",
      "It works great Fast shipping. It comes with the batteries included that was great.\n",
      "Undecided AA batteries do not charge...AAA do though 🤷🏼\n",
      "Not satisfied The batteries die out too quickly and charge super slow.\n",
      "Charges fast as hell Ok I took a chance on this product. It has great reviews but I’ve never heard of them personally.  I can’t believe the bang for buck I got from this charger and batteries. I needed rechargeable batteries for my CB hand held radio and a few other backpacking electronics. These went from 10% to fully charged in 2 1/2 hours. Being the 2800s they definitely lasted double the time before I’ve had to swap out my batteries. I got an extra set of batteries they worked so well.on a 3 day trip I had what fell like infinite power in comparison to normal non rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "Buy it Excellent product. Good price and pretty quality ! No complaints. I have recharged the battery’s over 30x and they don’t seem to have lost any capacity.\n",
      "Works Great This charger and batteries work great. I like that I can charge aaa and aa batteries at the same time. Charger is not oversized and super easy to use.\n",
      "Absolute trash The batteries and charger don’t do anything. The batteries light up green when they think they are finished and can’t hold a charge near as long as the leading brands. Can’t wait to return this and the batteries I bought separately and buy a working product. Severely disappointed\n",
      "Works perfect Works as expected which is awesome.\n",
      "Poor product quality Batteries stopped working in April and will not charge anymore, just about 2 months after purchase. Poor product quality.\n",
      "Works great Perfect 👌\n",
      "Never mind figured it out. AAA Batteries go in differently than the AA's. Crisis diverted :)\n",
      "Works great So far so good\n",
      "Battery charger works as advertised. Charged batteries quick and easy,and led lights indicated charge status\n",
      "These batteries are bigger than normal AAs. Not by much, but enough. These batteries are bigger than normal AAs. Not by much, but enough that it makes them hard to insert and the product won't workI've used these in xbox controllers, keyboard/mice, and vr headset controllers, they don't hold a charge like they say they do.  The charger will stop charging them, and then whatever smart device I load them into, in particular the vr headset controllers, will show them 25-50% charged.  It makes no sense.  Very frustrating!\n",
      "Rivals the so called \"Best\" Brands Awesome rechargeable batteries that rival Enloop brand. Great for Speedlite Flashes along with every day use in remotes & gaming controllers.\n"

      "Perfect Awesome recharging batteries. I wish I would’ve found these sooner.\n",
      "Camera batteries Delivered on time and the charging was done quickly and the charge seems to be lasting. Very pleased.\n",
      "Charge AAA & AA at the same time Perfect charger for the family. I like the way we can charge AA and AAA at the same time. And with one charger, not two. We go through a lot of batteries. This helps us be more green.\n",
      "Very useful I really love but I didn't realize you can only use Powerball batteries.\n",
      "Batteries last quite a long time after a charge. All batteries are good to go out of the box. Have gone through three cycles of discharging and charging of the batteries and have not experienced any issues.  Very pleased with the performance of the unit.\n",
      "Short working time These are worse than buying cheap batteries from a flea market. I put them on charge as soon as I got them. They charged quickly.I put them in my 80 lumen headlamp and the only lasted about 10 minutes on full power. To quantify that using the cheapest AA batteries I can normally get ( 3)  30 minute walks in be I need to change them out.\n",
      "No more batteries in the garbage This was the answer I needed for a airmouse remote that eats batteries! I was changing batteries every 10-14 days, which I still must do, except I'm now able to use the freshly charged ones and  charge the used batteries for the next time instead of throwing them in the garbage!!\n",
      "Good performance I’ve used these for about 6 weeks. I use the AA for decorative led string lights that turn on automatically every night for 6 hrs. The AA last much longer in the lights than Energizer; however, they take about 8hrs  to charge. I think this is because the charger uses a USB cord (included) with an adapter(not included). I tried an Apple charger but it got too warm. I’m using an Amazon surge protector outlet/USB  and that is doing fine. I plan on buying another pack of AA on my next Amazon order. Until then I’m just alternating the 2 lights. Overall, very good performance. I can run the lights for 42hrs on one charge. That’s about 2xs longer than rechargeable Energizers. (I always recycle all my recharge batteries every Christmas). I hope to get 1 yr of charges out of these. I’ll let ya’ll know in Dec.\n",
      "Absolutely MUST HAVE because batteries will get cleaned out in the next man-made/natural disaster Was delivered promptly, worked exactly as advertised. All batteries charged and ready-to-go should the need arise. Can't comment on any of the \"Overall Rating\" features because I haven't had it long enough or had to use it yet.\n",
      "Must buy These batteries are simply outstanding. They last in my xbox controller days longer than the best alkaline battery. I haven't weighed them against a non rechargeable battery but against 2000mah Energizer battery it weighs 10 grams more. The only negative at all is the charger is a little slow but that's not really a bad thing. It means it won't overheat the battery and prolong it's life\n",
      "Good purchase So far so good with this purchase. I really like that it fits both AA and AAA batteries.\n",
      "Batteries stop holding a charge quickly Got these hoping to save some $ on having to buy batteries and was excited when they arrived. I used them inside over Christmas and they stopped powering decorations after the 2nd recharge. Now they won’t hold a charge at all and the charger itself shows a green light (that they are full). Too good to be true I guess!\n",
      "Thanks Thanks good buy\n",
      "Charger comes with batteries This product was a pleasant surprise. It works as described. You can use any combo of AAA or AA batteries. It charges quickly but time will tell more. However, the charger came with batteries. Four AAA and four AA (part of the charge cost). I ordered additional AAA & AA but now I have a working # of batteries for my family.\n",
      "Good value Charger arrived damaged. Immediately replaced and arrived in 2 days. Works great batteries great so far they stand by the product\n",
      "Works great! I was a little wary of buying this because of lack of brand name, but I’m pleasantly surprised. It works great, with no problems. The batteries charge super quick and last a long time. I have two double-A’s in my Xbox controller and I play maybe an hour a day, 5 days a week. It’s been approximately two weeks since I inserted the batteries, and it’s still going strong. I’m happy with this product.\n",
      "Seems to work Seems to work. Have really only used the AAA batteries and the charge has been good. The LED lights seem to run on a timer rather than actually measuring charge though. I took a battery that had charged all the way to green, took it out of the charger then put it right back in and the LED light went back to red again. So, it's probably not as high tech as it advertises to be, but the batteries are working so far.\n",
      "Very good quality As described\n",
      "Its nice. Its really nice. But when I pick it up from charger its hard to do that, tight.\n",
      "Worth the money Purchased this item because I was tired of buying batteries. Worth the money. The batteries last a long time and charge fairly fast. Not disappointed with the purchase.\n",
      "Note: USB charger. Needs AC adaptor. Disappointed and didn't realize this was not an AC charger. Uses USB for charging so need an AC adapter. Lucky I had one\n",
      "Sigh I didn’t get the small batteries\n",
      "Not enough charge to use it in Wii remote Don't buy\n",
      "Long lasting batteries for an excellent price and fast customer service I have been buying Eneloop or Tenergy rechargeable batteries but when I saw the price of these and all the good reviews and the fact that it came with a charger that held a large number of batteries I figured it was worth a try and so far they have not disappointed. There was a small issue with some batteries missing from the package so I wrote PowerOwl and they replied almost immediately and said I could order another 8 pack of batteries and that they would refund me which they also did right away.  I'd highly recommend these.\n",
      "Great Battery recharger, nice capacity, eco friendly Great battery recharger for the size, we use a lot of batteries due to having two kids, it helps us save on constantly buying new batteries, nice capacity charging 8 batteries at once, doing our part to be eco-friendly. not constantly throwing away batteries.\n",
      "Nice charger! With all the batteries that need charging, now I don't have to charge two at a time.  This product has made my life a lot easier.\n",
      "Nice for lazy guys. My kids has many electric troys,so I need to buy the 2A and 3A battery frequently.I am lazy,I bought the charging device then it can resolve my problem.It is so cool.There are 8 rechargable batteries including 4 2A ones ,4 3A ones.So friendly combined stuffs.I don't need to buy the battery seperately.\n",
      "Works as expected Very simple design, each of the 8 slots accepts both AA and AAA batteries. Each slot has its own LED indicator, red for charging, green for fully charged (or empty). It takes a few hours to charge a fully drained battery. This battery charger and rechargeable batteries work as expected.\n",
      "Nice mixed set of AAA/AA rechargeable batteries and charging unit! Happy to be helping the environment (even a little bit) by not tossing more batteries out. I know we are far from perfect, but every chance I can, I will use these rechargeable batteries instead. I can’t rate the battery life yet as I know batteries seem to go south at different rates and I am not constantly using things with batteries, but they are good for anything, really. Using a AA battery in my wireless mouse and it works as expected. But happy to have these around for remote controls, toys, etc. And I will invest in more as well.Charging batteries are red LEDs in the charging unit, and once they hit capacity, LEDs turn green. Doesn’t take more than a couple of hours to fully recharge. Very happy with this purchase.\n",
      "As advertised and works well with USB solar power charger I was pleasantly surprised that all 8 sockets support charging both AA and AAA batteries. This charger is convenient for my mobility because it works well with a USB solar power charger.\n",
      "Yep, works good Works great, charges until charged and indicator light turns green no cons really\n",
      "Wow Better than lithium ion batteries! Wow ;)\n",
      "Batteries too big to work These batteries are bigger than normal AAs. Not by much, but enough that it makes them hard to insert and the product won't work. Don't waste your money on these!!!!!\n",
      "Convenient charger with batteries This charger which includes rechargeable AA and AAA batteries is very convenient. It plugs into a USB port but you can plug the cord into a wall charge. The charging time is pretty good. The batteries hold the charge for a long time. I really like that it charges both sized batteries since many items in my house use one size or the other.\n",
      "Great Value, Money Saver, Dual Duty! This battery charger is an exceptional product on so many levels! First, it saves so much money because it charges batteries for reuse. Second, it charges 2 sizes of batteries (AA & AAA). Third, it is USB-powered, making it convenient at home or on the go! As my picture shows, it is currently charging 4 AA & 4 AAA batteries, and it is plugged straight into my recliner! Fourth, it’s under $25 for the charger and your initial battery set. Finally, it’s manufactured by PowerOwl, an OEM battery specialist. I give this product an A++!\n",
      "This Item is ok It's a little slow charging but I hope it will be ok thanks.\n",
      "Great so far So far so good.  Exactly what I needed.\n",
      "Needed the batteries, keychain light was an added bonus. These rechargeable batteries are an improvement over the optional CR123 batteries. I literally have flashlights in every room, in my car and on my person all the time. Replacing the CR123 batteries can get expensive. I'm in the process of installing these rechargeables in all my compatible lights as they also give a longer running time of the lights. I'm saving the CR123's for emergency replacements.\n",
      "Buyer beware These dont last but a year , then to  buy some more ugh .Too expensive  ,the flash light broke so i sent that back, they did give my a new one in return. But now im replacing the rechargeable  batteries.\n",
      "Long run time A rare good rechargeable flashlight battery - I have two sets and two flashlights - long run time. Note that charge time is also long, so best to plug them in at night (ready in the morning). High quality. No Issues.\n",
      "Amazon should not sell these dangerous batteries. One battery exploded in my spotlight when I charged it. The explosion took away my spotlight, plug and some glasses. Luckily nobody stood there when explosion happened. I don't know why Amazon sells such batteries. Want to kill us?\n",
      "Melted in my flashlight. One battery got extremely hot in very short time. It melted in my flashlight before I took it out. Thank God my hand was ok.\n",
      "Great innovation Outstanding idea putting charging port in cell. I have no charger and dont need to spend an additional $15.  Fits starl@!#÷ and fe%#$ nicely, found some other top brands with higher mAh for close to same price... Will check back with longevity of fe#%£ battery and life.\n",
      "Great buy Exactly what I needed for my stream light.\n",
      "Quality rechargeable More cost effective and greener than replaceable batteries. Good run time in the light\n",
      "WORKS FOR STREAMLIGHT  HL-X These batteries are not labeled SL-B26 but they do have the same part number (220115), and yes they are 18650 batteries. Works like a charm in my Streamlight HL-X that did not come with the dual fuel setup. I just couldn't bring my self to buy a bunch of 123 batteries.The flashlight is a cool addition, pretty bright, small, cool clip.Nothing to complain about here.Be kind to each other\n",
      "Love these batteries! Great set of batteries. The little light that comes with them is super bright for it's size too! Nice little extra prize to have. These are awesome. Too bad it doesn't come with a charger though\n",
      "best batteries I've tried multiple brands these stream light batteries are the best\n",
      "Five Stars The batteries came individually wrapped and with a micro USB charger split 4 ways (one for each battery.) These specific batteries are really cool because they can be charged with a micro USB charger rather then a specialized charger.\n",
      "Easy to use I was trying to buy chargeable batteries and found these USB ones. Very easy to use, excellent, charges easy and fast, would purchase again.\n",
      "Excellent product Very satisfied with these 9v rechargeable batteries. These batteries are great for high drain applications like kids toys, they are works well in my son's toys. Great batteries so far. They charge quickly and no battery charger needed.\n",
      "Good quality! I purchased these 9V lithium batteries for my camera and now it last for a week and still working well , these are one of best rechargeable I used for my camera, it will keep work in my camera untill the end of their capacity.Highly recommended for items that need a lot of current with little resistance.\n",
      "Great quality product! Great batteries with charger port built in!\n",
      "very convenient I love the new design for these batteries, they are able to be charged by USB. I had to bring a battery charger with me for my electric guitar when I go out before. Now I only need to bring a cable. This pack includes a 4 in 1 usb cable so all 4 batteries can be charged all at once,it is very convenient to charge.\n",
      "Long Lasting Battery I bought these for use in my instruments and effects pedals. And I put the battery in my guitar for 1 week, it still go on working. Great batteries, I will recommend it to my friends.\n",
      "Best 9V Rechargeable Batteries Just what I was looking for. I was considering buying a rechargeable battery to replace the old 9V for my smoke alarm, but I don't have the alone 9V charger, then I found this USB rechargeable 9V battery, what a wonderful charging design!!The rechargeable lithium ion battery and the micro usb cable charging are the reasons I purchase for this product. I don't have to buy a stand alone charger just plug this into my computer or power bank and 1-2 hours later I have a full charge battery.So far it worked well and fit perfectly in my smoke, so if you having doubt about them fitting in your electronics it's the same size as the standard alkaline 9V.\n",
      "Easy of recharging! Fantastic batteries, just using my phone charger to connect the batteries, it is easy to charge and charges quickly. And I put the battery in my smoke detector, it works great like the regular alikaline batteries.\n",
      "Good value Used these several cycles already, I am impressed with the power and life of these.The capacity is as advertised and last longer than my previous NIMh batteries, good value for the price.\n",
      "Lasts a long time, charges really fast I really love these batteries, these are not any old type of rechargeable batteries, it is the best 9V batteries I had used. They even come with a able with four ends to charge all the batteries at the same time is awesome, the battery charges fast and lasts a long time.We got these to use in our camera, they have worked well so far.\n",
      "Absolute junk! These so called batteries will not hold a charge.\n",
      "AA Rechargeable Batteries Great product.  If you need batteries this product is a must buy!\n",
      "They last They hold the charge for a long time. I love that you can charge them without a bulky charger\n",
      "Disappointed Though this was a good product until I finished charging them. Used on battery on my razor and it lasted for barely 10mins before dying. I didn't use the charger that came with it since I wanted only one battery at the time and just used a single micro USB. I charged it over night as well before using it.\n",
      "Worth the money They really  work and easy to use.\n",
      "They do not hold a charge at all. Tried again and again but they do not hold a charge at all. Sitting in a roku remote for 1 day drained it entirely. Complete waste of money.\n",
      "Great way to save money! These batteries will save you so much money in the long run! I bought these for my game controller, which has a habit of chewing through batteries, and they have been a lifesaver!\n",
      "So so So so\n",
      "Crappy power. A gimmick! These came dead, so, I followed the instructions and charged them for 6 hours, as per directions. I put them in a hair trimmer and it ran EXTREMELY slow, getting slower as I shaved. I tried the 2nd pair and they were almost dead also. Good idea, but DEFINITELY NOT PRACTICAL AT THE COST OF 4 DOLLARS PER BATTERY.\"WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN\"\n",
      "Very poor cells The battery life in use is ok but only if used immediately after charge.  8 out of 8 nearly fully discharge sitting for a week.\n",
      "Bad buy Takes forever to charge and can’t hold the charge\n",
      "Need to charge before use Good\n",
      "Never Have to Look for AA batteries The convenience of these is undeniable. So far though, I can't tell if they are fully charged. I would expect the red LED to change to green but that doesn't happen... it stays red as long as the batter is on the charger. I'm using the batteries in an xbox controller and so far, they seem to last.\n",
      "10 Hour Batteries The Batteries Last Ten Hours To Light A Small Mini Christmas Tree.\n",
      "stop global warming theses batteries are environmentally friendly because they are reusable and thats nice\n",
      "Throw away your dead  \"Rechargeable\" batteries that you \"Overcharged\" in the battery charger Great product - the batteries come with their own built in battery charger via micro USB AND the battery Charge level indicator as well. This means you ONLY charge when they need a charge - and can be charged from almost any USB power supply - like your portable phone charger OR Power brick. If you travel a lot - it is GAME OVER for ever needing to buy ANY battery at ridiculous Airport prices :)\n",
      "4 batteries in a package but only 2 work. Very disappointed. 4 batteries in a package but only 2 work. Very disappointed.\n",
      "Worth it Great batteries set\n",
      "Last Long & Charges Quickly PROS:• You can charge these batteries virtually anywhere!• Li-ion technology in a AAA format.CONS:• None.\n",
      "Works well. I bought these for my computer keyboard and so far they have lasted almost a week and I still haven't had to charge them.\n",
      "Do not last long for constant used devices like a mouse I bought thee to use in my wireless mouse.  They don't even last a week without having to be replaced.\n",
      "A bit too high on the Voltage, but very steady. Comparing to a couple of other brands of LI-Ion AA cells, which read 1.49 to 1.51 volts, these AAA batteries are a bit high at 1.66 to 1.67 volts.  This actually matters in some equipment, especially when only in single or double battery configurations.  I have put these to use in application of 3 or more batteries, mixed with a couple of NiMH batteries, which allows for a voltage boost that doesn't overload the circuit.  The high voltage (for whatever reason) really affected some sound-dampening headphones, which caused me to first believe that there was a problem with the headphones.  Turns out, just a bit too much voltage.  But, this does help with mixing into my collection of NiMH, as they sometimes fall just a bit short in the voltage requirement department.  Mixing makes it just right.\n",
      "Good job I do question how long it'll last but I think it works great for what it is.\n",
      "Works Great Bought this so I wouldn't have to keep getting 9 volts for my electric guitar, works great, had it for months now on one charge\n",
      "More versatile because of not having to use a conventional charger. I do like being able to charge the battery without a conventional charger.\n",
      "Save your money If you dont mind charging it every other day to use it in a battery, it'll work if not save your money!\n",
      "Brings a ton of convenience Brings a ton of convenience when I am traveling. I do business trips a lot and I have been wanting a recharge battery for a long time to charge my Microphone and my camera. 9v battery work amazingly well and I am surprised how much power it contains. Charge fast and easy.\n",
      "Good Last long time charges fast\n",
      "Not 9 Volts! Charger turns green at 8V. Off charger, a fully charged battery reads 7.78V on my DMM. Not enough voltage for any device that requires more than 8.4V to operate.\n",
      "Cheaper than buying 9 volt batteries in the long run I use it for a stem machine At Last by the 9 volt batteries\n",
      "Pretty cool battery I bought this battery for my TENS unit, and it fits fine - it is within the standards for a 9v battery size (the standard is pretty generous...). I love that it does not need a separate charger, and lights to tell when it is charging/done. Seems to work fine. Can't speak to its longevity yet, though.\n",
      "Its very functional and easy After using several rechargables over the years I chose to go with this one because of its simplistic design. Nothing to really remember except the proper orientation of the batteries. ie: + and - poles...lol Even my no tech Uncle who left a phone in its box for months because he didnt know how to use it and waited on me to tell him how.. He got this right from the start!\n",
      "great rechargeable batteries at an even better price this day and age everything seems to run on batteries and replacing them all the time adds up if you don't switch to rechargeable batteries. These had great reviews and good capacity so I purchased eight and gave them a try- quick charge to full  and everything running great. These are a good option for electric toothbrushes and evere kind of remote as you won;t see a drop in performance. so impressed buying the aaa and more aa today.\n",
      "My #1 choice die to price and quality Super value for money vs any other product in the market..\n",
      "a a\n",
      "Made batteries cheaper Made things easier, environmental and economical.\n",
      "Meh So far slightly disappointed because the batteries were not Pre charged. I’ll change my review on the longevity and reliability of these batteries. So far I have a set of 16 Ebl brand and those are amazing. Hopefully these stack up to the ebl.\n",
      "Bad for my son's toy I got it for about 2or3 months, it last very short time for my son's toy car.  And shorter and shorter! Fake capacity!\n",
      "These batteries are adequate for moderate power requirements... Since I have been using this batteries to power one of my battery operated personal fans, I noticed that they can power it for 4 to 6 hours before noticeably losing energy or becoming completely depleted.  I suggest that you buy at lease 16 of them so that you can always have 8 fully charged and ready for use.  Also, you will need to have a good quality battery charger in order to re-charge them overnight.  One very good thing that I noticed is that if you completely discharge the batteries, they still appear to completely recover after you have re-charged them.\n",
      "they work Just what I wanted\n",
      "7 months and already dead I have only had these for 7 months and already they are not holding charge anymore. We don't use these a crazy heavy amount. I'd say a medium amount and already all of them are dying.\n",
      "Good value for the buck The item came fast. They are green and come in a nice little plastic container to protect the batteries. Good value for the buck. As far as longevity I will have to see and come back to that. They come pre charged  so they were ready to go.\n",
      "Thank Thank you\n",
      "Never Buy Name Brand Again! I stopped buying name brand batteries forever ago because I found that these rechargeables were perfect for what we needed them for.  We primarily use them for our soap dispensers and baby toys.\n",
      "I bought these batteries for my panasonic cordless telephone, I bought these batteries for my panasonic cordless telephone, low & behold they only lasted four months.Had to visit Best Buy.\n",
      "I would NOT have bought this had it known it was made in China Please mention the country of origin, I have placed myself in a position where I want to boycott Chinese products until Chinese communists subscribe to rule of laws and treat citizens of other countries and religious minorities with respect. Gross violation of rules and human rights cannot go hand in hand with business.\n",
      "They don't last 1 Year Review. These batteries were purchased for a landline that does not get used often. After one year 2 of these have lost most of their capacity. They don't ever charge fully and the phone dies within 15 minutes. Surely we can expect more than 1 year out of batteries in this day and age.\n",
      "Horrible. Worse then 1500 regular Duracell I bought these to put in my smart lock at home. Normal 1500 Duracells were lasting about a month. I've had to swap these out 4 times in 2 months. I was hoping they would last 6-8 weeks. Not 2, I don't recommend these at all.\n",
      "Like most other rechargables These batteries work like most other rechargeable batteries.  They seem to work very well at the start but quickly fade out and lose energy the longer you use them and the more times you recharge them.  I was hoping for better quality and longer life out of these but they seem no better or no worse than any of the other rechargeable batteries on the market,  I would recommend these because they seem to have the best price.If this review was helpful to you please click helpful below!\n",
      "Decent Batteries for cheap I had the last batch of these for 6 years. High quality for a low price. I suspect being an amazon brand they would not have any problems swapping them out if they were not good. Amazon might treat their employees like crap, but they have some great deals on great products.\n",
      "Rechargeble Batteries OK\n",
      "Very good These have been great. Using in xbox controller and last me days compared to my old xbrand rechargeables.\n",
      "Batteries Work well\n",
      "Good for a while and in the right situation I found these batteries good for my initial use of them. Their effectiveness in my case dropped drastically within 6 months of buying them. I was them in a school in Indonesia where it is very humid. I suspect your environmental conditions will have a big impact on their lifespan. I have used others of these batteries in Washington State to better effect and longevity.\n",
      "not as good as eneloop I had purchased these in hopes they were as good as the Eneloops made in Japan. So far the capacity seems to be less than 1/4 capacity. I am sorry I did not return them ASAP when I noted made in China! a mistake I will not make again. this applies to AAA and the AA I had purchased both...I wasted my money...the Eneloops are going strong the Amazon Basics...nuf said.\n",
      "Not even AA size The button tops aren't even full length. Here they are in a gameboy (dmg), too short to make contact with the metal. Sent them back and got eneloops.\n",
      "Very \"meh\" These lasted only 2 years. Was not impressed with the amount of charge they held and have since upgraded to better rechargable batteries.\n",
      "Received a replacement and still seeing noticeable issues with these batteries. These are poor quality rechargeable batteries. Purchased in January, and only charged 3 times and can barely hold a charge for 10 minutes of use in an Xbox controller.I received replacements a month ago, and after 3 charges they also can barely hold a charge for 10 minutes of use in an Xbox controller.Do not buy these batteries!\n",
      "Wasn't why I expected from all the reviews I seen After 7 months they didn't last as long and the cover started to peel and they over heat and some won't even last a week fully charged on my tv remote\n",
      "No longer made in Japan. These used to be made in Japan but as of 2020 are made in China. The old ones were a great value, Amazon please bring back the Sanyo rebranded batteries.  Until then these are a definitely no go.\n",
      "PERFECT These solar batteries work like a charm in my solar powered items on my patio.  Very pleased.  Do not know longevity yet.\n",
      "Good but nothing special It looks like normal battery, nothing special or better then other one chiper.\n",
      "Work as expected (not charged on delivery) Work as expected, though not coming charged. So first time charging takes a little longer. Try placing them in the charger several times and they will charge well!Once charged they work flawlessly.\n",
      "Great low cost investment I’m so glad I finally got rechargeable batteries! My Mac uses batteries for the keyboard and trackpad and rips through them, this just makes better economic sense. And 50% of my sons toys require batteries. They don’t appear to fully recharge, maybe get to 80%, but that’s still vastly better than buying and burning through regular, toxic batteries constantly. I got two packs so I always have the backups ready when I need them.\n",
      "No full charge After a full charge and placed in remote only shows 3/4 charge. Batteries that came with charger show full charge.\n",
      "Work great These batteries work great and last a long time\n",
      "Good No issues. Holds charge for plenty of time.\n",
      "Size is a bit of an issue These batteries work very well.  However, something to note is that they are slightly thicker that normal AA batteries.  For most items that is no big deal, but for me when I put them in the device I needed them for, the battery door wouldn't close.Like I said probably not a big deal on most things, it was just that the tolerance on the door was very close and so these batteries didn't work for my purposes.\n",
      "Good Better than my Energizer ones\n",
      "Did not work Died fairly quickly, wouldn't recharge.\n",
      "Good batteries but Used this brand before but this time two of the eight refused to be fully charged.  10 hrs on two different chargers\n",
      "To soon to tell So far so good but the proof of quality is how they last over time with multiple recharges. Ask me again in a year.\n",
      "Great Bang for your Buck Great bang for your buck haven't had any issues as of yet and have used 6 of the 8 batteries at least once\n",
      "5 Stars Good long lasting batteries at a great price.\n",
      "Amazon rechargeable batteries Great value for rechargeable batteries\n",
      "Too large in diameter These batteries are too big in diameter to be used in any of the devices I bought them for. Pretty aggravating. Why would they make a \"standard\" battery larger in diameter??!\n",
      "Did not work I tried them in various devices, from flashlight to kitchen scale. They simply did not work. Charged them again and again to no avail.\n",
      "Doesnt work in most things I wanted Thought it would be better to get rechargeable for 2 large vases I have with the tiny lights. Generally batteries will last about a month. Each uses 3 dbl AA. This don't work at all in them. Also a flameless candle I have that uses 2 dbl AA's, works for maybe half a hour....haven't tried in anything else. But would not buy again.\n",

      "Don't fit I bought these rechargeable batteries for my son while he is away at college.  Though they fit fine in his computer mouse, they did not fit in his toothbrush not his flashlight both of which take AA.  These AA are definitely not standard sized and will not fit in all devices which take AA.\n",
      "Good bang for buck, CAUTION: they're a bit big Good rechargeable option, especially if the price is right, the high capacity on these AA are a big step up. True 1.2 volts on my meter. One problem, they're a bit big. I measured them a few hundredths of an inch bigger than competitors and I'm guessing that's from the rubber-like wrapping; it led to some hassle getting it out of a MagLite\n",
      "AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries I use these AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries for a hunter camera that I setup to watch the inside of the RV I’m staying in since I have to leave on occasion and want to see what happens a while I’m away for several hours at a time. It takes a bit to recharge just like any other batteries in the category. The price for the pack of 8 is well worth it and once fully charged last several days when I turn my camera on and off periodically to record what happens while I’m out.\n",

      "Batteries work well These are great batteries, though I feel like they didn’t last quite as long as regular batteries. Since they are rechargeable, it doesn’t matter to me that they don’t last as long because I can pop them back into the Amazon Basics charger.\n",
      "Best value batteries Everything is great!  These batteries  work well.\n",

      "I expected better from Amazon branded product Not nearly as good as I expected, basically they don't hold a charge very long - seem over rated @ 2400 mAhusing in my Panasonic Lumix 7.2 MP camera so they certainly aren't over worked.I'll probably return them but figure I'll run them for awhile and see what happens.  I've used 3 different chargers;2 Energizers (they trickle charge) and 1 Lenmar charger... same results.BTW, for comparison purposes I was very happy with the Amazon Basics 'AA' Alkaline batteries, just wish these rechargeable Batteries were as good performance wise.\n",

      "Not as good as Eneloop These batteries worked out of the box but over time they will not hold a charge.  This is my first bad experience with an Amazon Basics product.

      "Best results for the money Great value\n",
      "Ok but too wide for lots of devices. I really liked these batteries in the beginning but there’s a problem with the width of the batteries. Since they are wider than the conventional ones, they do not fit into most of our home devices. Won’t be buying again.\n",

      "As usual, Amazon products seem to be very high quality Tried these so I could compare them to the expensive Duracell rechargeable batteries. As usual, Amazon's product seems to be at least equal to the brand names.

      "Works great Amazing batteries.\n",

      "Need longer life once charged to me These seem to not hold a charge very long. I’ve tried them like 3 dif times. As in once charged the last in my remote about 1/3 the time of store non-recharging batteries.  They do last in smoke alarms about a year off a charge.\n",
      "Value for money Using for remote and kids toys. So far good.\n",

I am glad i took an extra look around and found these.  The top rated in the video are from a large self assembled furniture store that is not in my are, but these actually have a higher mah rating.

They don’t fit in my husbands hair trimmer, they don’t fit in my electric toothbrush...... I am sooooo disappointed.\n",
      "Don't buy these. I had these for 3 years now.  They work ok but are terrible when compared to eneloop battiers.  Eveloop can hold a charge for a year. These maybe a couple of weeks.  If you want to recharge the batteries just before using them then they are a okay buy,  If you want batteries to use in here and now then don't buy these.  I will be replacing these with eveloops or something else.\n",

Product I put them in didn't work. Tested them and they're weak. So now I put them in the charger. We'll see. Definitely not precharged, or were a long time ago.\n",

      "Decptive mAh Rating and Made in China The Amazon high capacity 2400 minimum mAh rechargeable batteries would have been a decent value for the money, if only they worked as expected.  You won't be able to use them right out of the package though, since they were only about half charged.  However, the worst problem is that after discharging/charging the 8 batteries (3 times each), I only achieved on average 2260 mAh.  None of the batteries ever hit the minimum 2400 mAh, as stated on the batteries themselves.  These batteries used to be manufactured in Japan, but have since been switched to China, thus the lower mAh results.  For most people looking for high capacity batteries, these are probably a definite pass.  I had Amazon pick-up my battery order for a full refund...\n",

Full charge on those older batteries only reaches about 85% and is fully drained within 2-3 workdays.This new generation of batteries just simply doesn't work. The light on the mice rarely kick on and if they do, they won't connect over Bluetooth. Similar with keyboards. The batteries work in flashlights and kids' toys just fine.  So some would say the problem is Apple's.  I disagree.\n",
      "Don't hold a charge I have bought these a couple of times, the first time I figured I just got a bad batch, but no... without fail I can charge these to full and they're going low almost immediately.  Using a 4 pack in my kevo lock lasts less than a week (2-3 activations per day.)I'm using them in remote controls since that'll get me a few weeks, but won't purchase again.\n",

He put two in his Xbox one remote on Christmas Day ! He just had to charge those two batteries I think it was Monday 3 February 2020.  So yeah I have to say they’re really good batteries and definitely would recommend them again.\n",

I have nothing left. Some of the batteries went bad after 3 months, some after 6. They are just not long lasting. I bought some energizers older than these and those are still holding up.\n",

      "Very poor longevity I purchased these batteries as each battery was less expensive than the comparable Eneloop. I will never make this mistake again. I have had these batteries for about 3 years, assuredly less recharges than the \"hundreds\" of times that the marketing materials purport that each battery could be charged before failing, but out of the original 8 purchased four now no longer charge. I am not the best at maths but that is at least a 50% failure rate at a minimum of half of the number of alleged charges. The Eneloops that I purchased two years prior are still working as advertised without a single failure. I will continue to pay the money for the Eneloops knowing that it is not money wasted.\n",
      "One of Four Batteries Would Not Accept Full charge I got the batteries new.  They were fully discharged by my recharging machine and after they were fully charged  I inserted them into my portable radio.  I noted that one battery wouldn't accept a full charge but 3/4 of a charge.\n",

      "Dead In A Year When I saw these batteries, I was skeptical that they would live up to the hype. They did not. Right from the start they had a low charge. When I tried to charge them, the best I could get was 80% capacity on only one of the batteries. I returned them and got a replacement.The new batteries were charged, but quickly lost it when using in low power devices like an analogue wall clock. I recharged them and they seemed to hold it for longer. However, the ones not in use lost their charge in about a month. I should have gotten a refund at that point, but I didn't.A year out, they will not charge at all. They are dead. Don't waste your money on these, buy Eneloop or Duracell rechargeable batteries. They work much better.\n",

      "Buyer Beware! These batteries are not the ones previously sold on Amazon. They have since been replaced with low end Chinese produced batteries. The tested capacity came up to about 2200 which is far from the \"high capacity\" states in the description of 2400. For nearly two dollars each, it should be as marked. Will be returning, thanks for knocking off your own product with a Chinese one (previously made in Japan).\n",

      "Slightly fatter than standard alkaline battery I bought these to power a device with a \"slide-in and replace the cover to complete the circuit\" kind of battery compartment. The compartment accommodates standard alkaline AA batteries just fine, but these rechargeables are slightly fatter. Consequently, they don't slide all the way into the compartment, and I needed a tool to get them to come back out.This issue probably won't impact you for devices with spring loaded battery compartments, but consider your application before you buy these.\n",

No more having to wait until I have time to go to the store. Just charge them overnight, or while I'm at work, and when I come back, it's good to go.\n",

      "Batteries don't last I purchased 16 batteries and, at first, they held a charge parallel to regular single use batteries I'd tried.  However, after the 2nd recharge, they began holding less and less of a charge.  I've been using them on led string lights in my kitchen, so very small lights and short strands.  Single use batteries last 2 weeks.  At first the Amazon batteries lasted 2 weeks but now last 1 day.  I purchased these batteries late November so they basically didn't even last a full 2 months.  Don't recommend this product.\n",

I cycled them all through the Discharge–Refresh cycle on the OPUS charger, which is three full cycles.  After that, they showed a capacity of between 806 and 830 mAh.  This is significantly better than my Energy AAA cells, which are around 760 mAh.I can't yet speak to their longevity.\n",
      "Bought mine back when made in Japan, Will not buy anymore. Needed more high capacity rechargeable batteries, so I figured I'd buy more of these Amazons, as the last ones I bought have treated me well.  Come to the page and see a different picture.After doing some investigating these are different batteries made in China.  Even though the page description says \"Same product, new look! Appearance of batteries you receive may vary.\"The best evidence I could get that these are made in China was the user manual you can get somewhere down the page.  I would like to see pictures of the new batteries to confirm this, but I am not willing to take the risk.\n",
      "Good Product A little too expensive, but it works.\n",
      "Lerfect Great product\n",
      "DON'T BUY THESE!!!!!!! Absolute crapola. Read the reviews and seemed like the newer batches of these suck but tried anyway. Yeah, They suck. They all took an initial charge, but half won't work at all the second day. Spend the extra and buy powerex or enerloops or anything but these. Immediate return.\n",
      "It worked Fine batteries\n",
      "works good works good\n",
      "They do not come precharged! I'm really disappointed because I bought AA and AAA. It says they are supposed to come precharged and they definitely weren't. I dont have time for them to charge up because I'm borrowing props for a photo shoot. Thanks to the lie on this page, the photo shoot isn't happening.\n",
      "Great batteries for a great price! These batteries are my go to for all my battery needs. They last long and were much cheaper than other alternatives. Great value!\n",
      "They work great and I will buy them again. They work great! Holds charge well and definitely lasts longer than my older rechargeables. I will certainly purchase more of them.\n",
      "Pre-Charged? These are advertised as coming pre-charged. No way. It took hours in my known good charger to get these up to a full charge. I realize pre-charged does not mean fully charged, but these weren't even close.\n",

      "Good replacements for phone Pretty good price and they hold a charge for us in the cordless phones! Delivered promptly and well packaged. I guess I liked the price best. Quality seems fine but have only used them for a few months, so far.\n",
      "Fits well and worked great Came charged up and fit well\n",

      "Charge lasts a few minutes, and it’s weak... These showed up with a weak charge, and after charging in the Amazon Basics charger, the charge lasted maybe 10 minutes. Disappointed, will go with a tried and true Energizer or Duracell battery.\n",
      "Slightly oversized diameter may not fit certain items. I'm overall happy with these batteries. Having said that, if you currently have a item that has a snug fit in the battery compartment as far as the diameter of the battery, these will be as tight and probably tighter and may not even fit.\n",
      "NOT AS ADVERTISED! The batteries are nowhere near the size I ordered - much, much smaller.  The description should include length and diameter.  Not worth the hassle to return.  Putting them in our \"battery recycle box!\n",
      "Had to be charged on arrival I ordered these rechargable batteries for my camera as I sell on ebay.  Took them out of the package and they were all dead!  In my charger now but what an inconvenience!\n",

      "Great rechargable batteries to keep around the house They work as well as Enveloop batteries and lots of people claim they are the same batteries, or made by the same manufacture. Either way, this is a great rechargable batteries to get and I recommend it.\n",
      "Perfect. Batteries are expensive and not good in landfills so this is the solution. My house is completely run on solar so charging doesn't even cost me a penny.\n",
      "Size is Slightly Off These are AA batteries but whatever Amazon used to wrap the batteries to label them Amazon Basics is too thick and it makes fitting them in designated AA spaces tricky. Some things the batteries work and some things they don't. Be leery of purchasing these.\n",
      "Made in CHINA - NOT Made in Japan I just received my order today. Made in China. Manufacture date: April 2019The body is gray with a green stripe on the positive end. It says Ni-MH 1.2V 2400mAH AA HR6But it no longer has \"High-Capacity\" printed on the battery.Cheaper, made in China batteries. No longer made in Japan.\n",

      "Don’t buy a waste of money you will see Amazon batteries rechargeable are basically a waste of money because overtime they don’t  hold a charge as long it’s more frustrating then it’s worth. It’s better just use fresh batteries I was trying to save some money but in all Reality it’s easier to have fresh batteries Plus you don’t have to worry about putting away a battery charger when not in use we all have chargers for different things why I have one for AA or AAA batteries when they don’t hold a full charge after a few times of using them.  If you buy you will see.\n",
      "Duracion de la carga de la battery Se descarga super rapido no travajas\n",
      "Work great short term... After a year of having these, they no longer hold charge for long. They worked great in the first few months but in our FirePlace Remote they only last about 1-2 weeks before switching and recharging.\n",
      "Good price Great replacement for phone\n",
      "Almost perfect The score on remote control was left  blank.  Amazon needs an N/A option.  There is no remote.Anyway, I use a lot of AA batteries with my immitation candles.  This was the perfect answer.  I ordered more batteries for my other AA battery uses.I did find the charger a bit finicky. The charge is in pairs.  There is a light that comes on when it is charging.  Last time I paid attention to this and had trouble getting the light on.  I didn't pay attention to it the 1st time and there were no issues.  I may just need to ignore it.  Slap 4 batteries in and walk away.\n",

      "Buy Eneloop batteries instead of these. Worst rechargeable batteries ever. Can barely hold a charge for a few weeks in a carbon monoxide or fire alarm sensor which use very little current.\n",
      "Damaged, weird hissing noise The batteries work more or less, but the batteries came scuffed (like the wrapping is beginning to peel) and the charger makes hissing noise. Just feels real cheap and suspect. Also the fact that you have to charge everything in pairs is annoying.\n",

Put two of them in my computer mouse. It would not work! I tried them all. None worked. I put them in my charger and charged them. THEY STILL WON'T WORK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I tried them in my flashlights. Won't work. Kids toys. Won't work.  THEY ARE CRAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "So far so good, however... Wow! A lot of mixed reviews about these. Running my own test over the twice-the-price Eneloops. No so worried about duration (similar mAh), rather, longevity is what I'm watching for. I will report back..One minor gripe - these batteries are advertised as \"Pre-charged\" yet half of them were almost totally dead out of the box.\n",

      "Work well and last These have saved us a small fortune. We all play Xbox on wireless controllers. I used to buy the battery packs for them but they would break and not hold a charge. These are the way to go. I wish I had them when my son was younger with his toys.\n",

They're now made in China and I won't be purchasing again. So many in-depth reviews have shown that Chinese quality and reliability are atrocious, Google it (example: Project Farm recently completed a second). Do your research and save yourself some coin... then maybe you can Toss a Coin to Your Witcher.\n",
      "Great batteries These batteries are a a must have for all your little one’s toys. I would go through countless batteries otherwise. They charge fast and stayed charged as long as non rechargeable batteries. Personally, I think they are better or maybe I just really like the fact I don’t have to keep buying batteries! Either way I’m happy with my purchase\n",

I have other rechargeable batteries that will work in the same cameras down to about 20 degrees. Below that nothing seems to work very long.\n",
      "Using with AmazonBasics charger resulted in several batteries going bad. I bought these together with the AmazonBasics charger. They worked great at first but after a few times recharging I started getting the red blinking light on the AmazonBasics charger. After some trial and error I figured out one of my batteries was bad which was causing the light. So I threw that battery away and things were fine again. Until a couple more recharges and then the light was back and once again another battery was bad. I threw that one away as well and the cycle has repeated now that my pack of 8 batteries is down to 4. I'm not sure if the problem is the batteries or the charger but my recommendation is to avoid both products.\n",
      "Not worth the savings. These batteries do not charge in all chargers as stated. I’ve had two different EBL chargers that only some will charge in. These batteries do not hold a charge for very long.\n",

      "Didnt work Did not come charged, or take a charge. Returned right away.\n",
      "High quality batteries that exceed expectations. Super high quality. I researched rechargeable batteries extensively before making my purchase, and the reason I sprung for these is because there are lots of talks from electrical engineers that Amazon went with a very high end Japanese battery maker to Re label these (this is a good thing...)When i put the batteries on a charging unit I learned that most of them would take nearly 3000 mAh worth of charge, which is more than Amazon rates them for\n",

For most of the batteries, when this happens, I can put them on my Eastshine S4 charger and they will charge back up just fine.  However, at least 2 of the 8 batteries deplete so far that the charger only displays \"Err\" because they don't even have enough charge left to detect what type of battery it is.  The only way to fix them is to \"jump start\" the bad battery by crossing a paper clip on the battery charger + terminals from one AA that is actively charging to the dead one.  It's not safe.\n",
      "No Longer A Quality Product - Now Crap AA Cells I have always been a big fan of the (Made In Japan) Amazon Basic Capacity Capacity 2400 mAh NiMH AA Batteries and own 96 examples.  Their performance and reliability have been second to none.  For my birthday I Required 2 new trail/wildlife cameras I’ll be using along with my other wildlife cameras in a research projects that I will be conducting over the next three years.  So on November 3, 2019 I purchased 16 more of these Amazon Basic High Capacity AA batteries.  Few days after acquiring the new batteries I put them in my chargers and charge them to full capacity... after the initial condition in charge and discharge.  Then on December 6, 2019 I took the batteries out of the case that I had them in and tested them before putting them into my trail cameras, and the batteries were at less the 50% capacity !!!I recharge the batteries and inserted them into the cameras and placed them out on the evening of December 6, 2019.  On Christmas day November 25, 2019 I removed the two trail cameras from the field and the batteries were almost completely dead After roughly 600 images and 2 second videos!  My other Amazon Basic 2400 mAh batteries in to other cameras were still showing a full charge.I examined the batteries that I bought on November 3, 2019, and instead of being made in Japan as my 96 other cells are, these new batteries are made in China!I cannot tell you how very disappointed I am in these new ‘Made in China’ Amazon Basic Crap Quick Self-discharge low-capacity AA batteries are.  They have a less capacity then Tenery Centura 2000 mAh low self-discharge AA... and the Centura AA are genuine low self discharge cells.Amazon had an excellent product in their original Made In Japan Amazon Basic High Capacity AA, but now they’ve replaced them with unreliable reliable poor performing crap!\n",

      "Physical size was a few shavings larger than a standard AA I bought the High Capacity AAs and have had them for about 10 months now. Unfortunately,  I've had 2 major issues with them.  1. It's surprising but these High Cap AA batteries from Amazon Basics seem to be just ever so slightly larger (physically) than Standard Alkaline AAs (like Duracells, Energizers).  2. Three of the batteries no longer held charge for very long after about 3 -4 month of very light useSo regarding the size, I was really surprised.  Eyeballing it looked about he same,  but every device I put them into (kids toys, Xbox Controller battery packs, etc, they were really snug and in some cases, made them really hard to remove from the device so I can recharge them.  For some devices, I was just a little fed up and decided to go back to using Alkalines for those devices until I ordered a set of Eneloops to replace these.As for the batteries that don't hold a charge for long, maybe I got duds.  I generally really have good luck with AmazonBasics products.  Maybe going high-capacity was pushing the boundaries of quality control on the batteries. It's also possible I left them too long between uses (3-4 weeks) and they drained out and couldn't recover.  Not sure, but I won't buy these again.  If anything, I'll probably stick with Eneloop rechargeables or give the regular (non-high capacity) AmazonBasics rechargeables in the future.\n",

      "Evaluate and break in Amazon batteries not made in Japan before rushing to judgement I am fairly new to rechargeables and the first thing that jumps out at me is the cost of any brand with a decent reputation.  To me that means spending the money up front to get \"smart\" charging and evaluation equipment.  That reduces the chances of ruining new batteries, or worse yet ruining the devices being powered.  I purchased a Nitecore and and an Opus bt-c3100.  Quickly I learned to categorize 18650 batteries into three rough groups:  total scam batteries that should never be used because they barely put out any power and cannot hold a charge.  From reviews I have seen that means 400 mah hours or so from an 18650.  The second category is the extremely common \"knock-offs\" that copy, sometimes well and many times poorly, popular top performers and sell for much less.  These from what I have seen and from my own observations can  have power output of anywhere from 30% to 80% or so of the power of the tried and true name brand.I thought long and hard before purchasing the newest Amazon AA nimh high-capacity knowing they were not made in the Panasonic eneloop factory and were fairly pricey.  But I felt  it would be a good learning experience and for now I only power led flashlights and solar walkway lights.The first thing I did was read the directions!!!!!!! and it said charge at 250 mah.  The nitecore only goes down to 300 mah so I first discharged them on the Opus at 200 mah for 12 hours 20 minutes to 1-1.1 volts and all four(sorry no statistically significant data from this guy) gave off a measured 2440 or more mah , a little better than the rating of 2400 mah.  Charging at 200 mah took 13 hours and the cells absorbed 2570 mah , well above the 2400 rating.I will leave the discharge and power analysis to the electrical engineers with the knowledge, expertise, and software.  I will give my layman's opinion that initially these four Amazon high-capacity nimh batteries are  not fakes stuffed with sand and appear more promising to deliver  good service than the knock-offs that cut critical corners to keep the price down.  I recommend to other newbies to take the time to charge all rechargeables conservatively with a smart charger.  It is probably a good idea to first discharge and recharge these batteries even though mine came fully charged.  You would not take your brand new car and redline the engine out of the showroom.  Show you Amazon batteries the same care.  Maybe Amazon should offer detailed break-in instructions with all new rechargeable batteries.  That could help eliminate many of the bad experiences and bad reviews.\n",
      "Not same voltage as an actual AA battery ONLY 1.2V THEY ARE ONLY RATED TO 1.2V! These batteries did not work to power my EL wire as standard disposable AA did. I believe its because they are only rated to 1.2V not the standard 1.5V of a disposable Lithium AA.\n",

They are no longer the high quality Japanese made cells.Considering you can get the Japanese cells still from Ikea for about 7 bucks per four battery cells, these are not worth the money to purchase unless they are on a very steep discount.\n",
      "No Contact - Zero Current No Contact: positive terminal comes up too short, almost flush with outer sheath. This keeps it from making contact in device leaving an open circuit and no current. This happened in a Logitech keyboard. It took a lot of fiddling to figure this out. Went \"backward\" to ordinary, non-rechargeables. Problem solved. This resulted in fewer rating stars.\n",

      "Leaking Amazon Basics AAA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack) I purchased my AmazonBasics AAA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack) in August of 2018.  Rarely have I had to use all four (4) at the same time.  Upon receipt, I charged them, used two (2) for a flashlight, and placed the other two (2) back in the box since I wasn't sure if it was OK to leave on the charger.  My charger automatically shuts off when the battery is charged, but I didn't want to void the 1-Year Warranty.  A lot of good that decision did me.The pair of Amazon Basics AAA I Placed in my flashlight in June 2019 were weak, and I went to the box to get the other set to replace them.  I found both batteries had leaked.  There was a white powdery substance in the box as well as on the batteries themselves.  They were kept in a dry drawer with nothing which could have initiated a problem.  I have read reviews where others have had this issue, but I thought it a user issue, meaning they must have left them on the charger.I have other rechargeable batteries I've had for longer, Duracell and Energizer types, and they are STILL as good as the day I bought them.  Not one problem.  Since it's been now almost 15 months since my initial purchase, I doubt very seriously Amazon will make any exceptions.  To avoid any potential of these harming and leaking in my devices, I am getting rid of all four (4).  I will not be purchasing Amazon batteries again.\n",

I Purchased them primarily to use with some Tasco XR8 (400 lumen high powered) flashlights that I use when walking my dog at night. The flashlights were eating up three AAA batteries every week when used on high power. I can report that for flashlights these worked perfectly. They actually seem to work for a little longer than the standard one time use batteries (I can't remember if they were duracell or energizer) that came with the flashlight.After using 6 of the batteries for flashlights, I had 2 left over. So, I tried to uses these with the many Remote Controls we have around the house. But the batteries would not work with any remote controls, I even tried switching out the batteries with 2 of the 6 batteries that I had dedicated to flashlights, and they still would not work with any of the remote controls. They would not work with my Vizio TV remote control, they would not work with my Amazon Fire remotes, and they would not work with my Amazon Dash Wand.Therefore if you need a great set for rechargeable Flashlight batteries theses are my favorite, but if you are looking for batteries for your remote controls, I simply can not recommend these.PROs:Perfect for high powered flashlights.CONs:I could not get them to work with any of my remote controls.\n",

Bonai showed all slightly less than 2200mAh capacity and 1.40V fully charged. AMZ Basics showed slightly under or over 2400 mAh and 1.27V fully charged.

They run down faster than a traditional battery, but for non-dire situations, it is fine since there is virtually no cost to simply recharge them. Over the past 2 years 4 of these died and no longer take a charge. They are not heavily used and spend most of their time in remotes and low use electronics.

Upon closer inspection, they are Made in China and the manufacturing date was Nov 2011! It was my mistake to not check and refuse them when I received them, because my \"new\" batteries had been on the shelf for 6.5 years! I don't know of any NiMH manufacturer that claims a shelf life of longer than 5 years, so the deep discharge on the shelf probably damaged them irreparably. Never again!\n",

I bought these walkie talkies the same week as the batteries and on Amazon as well.

      "Not a good first impression. I have tried these batteries and I am not thrilled.  First thing, my wife has these LED lights and the batteries do not even work at all.  I have been using Panasonic Eneloop batteries and they work perfectly in these lights.  It seems that the positive contact in the Amazon batteries does not stick out as far as Alkaline or the Panasonic batteries and therefore won't make contact with the contacts in the lights.  The Amazon batteries work well with flashlights and such.  I have used them in my Apple Trackpad and they work but don't seem to work very long, I had to replace them after a week.  I have charged the a few times since they arrived but they don't seem to last as long as the Panasonic.  I will keep using them and see if the life gets longer and will let you know.  I am not impressed.\n",

I put them on the charger i bough (i bought another one just in case one was defective) and all the light does is flash red. For ALL of them except one or two. Worst waste of money, they do NOT recharge and you're lucky to get one or two that works.\n",

      "Disappointing performance I tried these batteries in my solar dock lights. My solar lights are off while the battery charges during the day and then they turn on and stay lit from dusk until dawn.  The previous batteries I had were able to keep the dock lights lit all night long until they finally died (about 2 years of use).  These Amazon batteries were only able to keep the lights on all night for about 2 days. After that, the stay lit time dropped dramatically.  After about 1 month of use, the lights will only stay lit for about 2-3 hours.  Even worse, on some days, 1-2 of my lights won’t light up at all.These batteries are junk.  Also, please note that these batteries are slightly fatter (bigger around) compared to normal size AA batteries.  I had a little bit of difficulty getting them to fit in the battery compartments due to the bigger size.\n",

      "Great rechargeable batteries So far, batteries are working great.\n",
      "Expectations dashed I have an ever expanding collection of items that take AA & AAA batteries.  I currently have quite a few Eneloop batteries that have worked quite well, but are expensive.  After reading some reviews, I decided to give these a chance.  Despite having 850mhh capacity, they last about 1 day, where the 750mhh Eneloop batteries last about 4-6.Initially I thought it may have been the charger, but after replacing the charger, using both another new charger, as well as the same charger I've used for years with the Eneloop, I think these batteries are no good.  Don't waste your time or money on them.\n",
      "Still going Had them for months, very useful\n",
      "Terminal QA issues Can't comment on longevity yet, but the batteries may have a problem with making connection with battery contacts in certain devices.  The terminals do not stick out proud enough to make contact to all devices, such as my PC mouse.  The high insulated shoulder on the \"+\" terminal side hangs up on the socket of the Mouse and makes intermittent contact, if at all.  Compare to the Enerloop which has very clean shoulders, leaving plenty of terminal standing proud. Haven't decide yet to return them or try to modify to get rid of a few mils of thickness; or bend the mouse contact out more so it makes consistent contact.\n",

      "No longer made in Japan.  And there is a slight decline in quality. These batteries have not changed their advertising; but they have changed the country of origin.  These Amazon Basics batteries have gone through some changes  Started out as black with green leaf motif.  They were made in Japan, and their claimed capacity was the same as the Sanyo eneloop.  And about the time that Panasonic put their logo onto eneloop batteries Amazon Basics became grey with a thin green line circle at the top.  They had an electrical signature very similar to the eneloop which have become the “gold standard “ in terms of quality.  I have both AB and Panasonic batteries, and they meet and exceed their claimed capacities.  The main difference is that the Panasonic eneloop batteries are substantially more expensive.When I receive new batteries, I don’t care if they come “precharged “ or not.  Instead I put them through a couple of renew cycles.  I’v noticed that the capacity of the batteries increase after two sometimes three discharge test or renew cycles.When I bought some more AB rechargeables,  they were still grey, but the green circle at the top was wider than before.  And I found that one or two didn’t quite meet the claimed capacity on the first refresh cycle.  On the subsequent cycles, they met/exceeded their capacity expectations.  Upon using this newest incarnation of Amazon Basics rechargeable high capacity AA,I noticed that they needed to be recharged just a bit sooner than the previous generation.  Probably would not have noted the difference had it not been for the difference when initially charging, discharging, etc in the battery charger analyzers renew cycles.  That is when I used a magnifying glass and read Made in China on the batteries.I don’t know exactly when Jeff Bezos and co decided to charge his sourcing for manufacturing his brand. Just wanted to pass on that these Amazon Basics high capacity AA and AAA batteries are still good batteries.  That said, the Japanese made batteries are better than the ones made by the Chinese.Just to add that to charge and renew the batteries, I use the Accupower IQ 338 XL and the Opus BT 3400.\n",

      "Great value Works and charge like a charm.\n",
      "Exactly as described Liked item\n",

      "Now made in China Disappointed in the last order.  These have been made in Japan most recent order has different coloring and is made in China.  I'll update if these work as well, but still disappointed.\n",
      "These are excellent batteries. I use Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries in AAA, AA, C and D cell sizes. The work great and i swear by them.\n",
      "Rebranded Eneloop? They work good, maybe too good.  Those eneloops are more expensive but are they just re-branded Amazon basics or are the Amazon basics just re-branded eneloops.  The world may never know!\n",
      "Not the same quality from Japan / garbage from China They are no longer made in Japan / no made in China. The quality is not as good. Batteries come near dead . And about half of them need to be charged and discharged at least 4 or more time to work at all. These are not the deal they were before. Same with the AAA batteries.\n",
      "Good value for money. They work very well both in toys and in any other device that requires batteries. We save money in the long term by using rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "Worthless I should have read the reviews on this item.  I bought the AAA rechargeable batteries to replace the worn out batteries in my charleston path lights.  They said that they came fully charged.  Everyone one of them had a .7V reading, and a far cry from the 1.5V advertised.  I put them in my path lights anyway, and left them in the sun all day long, hoping that would charge up.  Wrong.  They are absolutely worthless.  A very sad day for a AMAZON  product.\n",
      "Don't like them. I bought them to use with my smoke detectors but they don't work with them.  I've tried using them on other products and they don't work very well.  not happy with them at all.  My smoke detectors are the Nest.\n",
      "Have shorter positive contact, do not work in many toys. These batteries used to be \"made in Japan\" and worked perfectly fine. My last order was different. Now they are \"made in China\" and have shorter positive contact, so they don't work in every other toy.\n",
      "Great Great batteries, came pre-charged and lasts long enough for me.\n",
      "Fizzle like a bad joke Dont hold a charge at all\n",
      "Great batteries Use these in basically everything that uses AA batteries.\n",
      "Made in China These batteries were made in Japan. They are now made in China. Buying Eneloop batteries from now on.\n",
      "Best rechargeable batteries I've used Still work great after using them for over a year. They last a long time too\n",
      "Good batteries for price Charge lasts a long time.\n",
      "Great battery They work great\n",
      "Great value Wasn't sure I'd like these, but they work better than Duracells\n",
      "NO LONGER MADE IN JAPAN I don’t know if these batteries will perform as well as other sets I have.  I always considered them to be quite a value.  I thought they were perhaps made in the same factory as some other high profile Japanese made batteries.  They went unavailable for a month or two and then on my purchase from last week... made in China...\n",
      "great product. Great product.  Received and worked as expected.\n",
      "Works like a charm Great item\n",
      "Garbage I use the batteries for my headlamp since I work early in the morning. I tried to save some money and get rechargeable one. The regular non rechargeable ones usually last about 2 months before getting too dim, these amazon batteries last about 3 days. Worthless\n",
      "I'd suggest Decent price, good quality. They don't strain as quick as others when just sitting. I'd recommend.\n",
      "will not recharge Will not reorder.Will not recharge.Jerry\n",
      "They work well I use the with solar garden lights and they charge in the sun and give ample power all night\n",
      "Great product Purchased as replacement batteries for our solar landscape lights. work great.\n",
      "Next Day is faster than shopping! Second time to buy these they work well for me!\n",
      "Work great Work great in my solar lights.\n",
      "Best for money. Period Best for money. Period\n",
      "Everyone need a few extras Love the, the come with a good charge and recharge quickly\n",
      "great and long lasting These last a long time and charge quickly.  I went from replacing batteries in various remotes kids use from at least once every 2 weeks to once every 2 months.......... LOVE IT\n",
      "Excellent Best batteries i ever used\n",
      "Now made in China and not Japan as for years before! New batches are now made in China and my tests have shown they preform worse than the older made in Japan Versions! Amazon should display that they changed factories and manufacuring country so people know that the years of Made in Japan version reviews are not longer valid.\n",
      "Good Good and powerful\n",
      "Not worth recharging Does not hold a charge very long in use and will lose a charge in storage.  Stick with Energizers.\n",
      "Waste of Money I have had this product for about a week. When I put the batteries into my device it did not work, so I charged the batteries. After a day I put it in my device again it still didn't work. So I left it in the charger for three days. When I put the batteries in my device it still didn't work. I thought that the device itself might be defective but when I put normal batteries in it worked just fine. I bought these to save money but I definitely just wasted it.\n",
      "Cost effective and environmentally friendly Hold a pretty good charge and are a lot more environmentally friendly than batteries you just throw out after one charge. Saves you money in the long haul too.\n",
      "Not a very good battery These AA batteries only last a few days in my game camera whereas Duracell’s last for ~a month or more( 8 batteries).  Very disappointing.  I will most likely ask for a return.\n",
      "Great battery Excellent battery at a great price\n",
      "GREAT BATTERY I DON'T USE THESE IN FLASH LIGHTS , BUT GREAT FOR ALL OTHER USES , IMPRESSIVE ON HOW LONG THEY RUN ON KEY BOARD ALSO IN CAMERA !!!\n",
      "Not durable - going back to Eneloops Was hopeful that these would be as good as the Eneloops that I have been using for years. After using numerous times, I discovered that these do not hold a charge as well as the Eneloops, and the batteries themselves are pretty fragile as others have noted. Some of the batteries have swelled and no longer fit into the electronics. The tops are coming off and the wrapping is peeling off the sides. Very disappointing\n",
      "Made in China - 10/11/2019 Product is made in China, expected to made in Japan... would also help if you out the origin on manufacture on the product listing.\n",
      "Good set of batteries Good value\n",
      "Long-Lasting Battery Life I’ve been slowly (very slowly) converting my house to be more self-sustaining.  As such, I’m taking small steps and one of the steps is using battery-operated sensor lights to illuminate my basement.  The lights I use (AMIR Motion Sensor Light https://amzn.to/2B3wjHu ) take three AAA batteries each.  The motion sensor lights come in packs of six.  That means I need 18 batteries for each light pack (as I said, this is a slow transition).Initially, I purchased one eight-pack of the Amazon Basics high-capacity rechargeables and bought copper-topped batteries for the remaining lights.  What I noticed was the copper-topped batteries wore out much quicker than the rechargeables. The rechargeables lasted two to three times longer (if not more) than the non-rechargeables.  I quickly realized I was being penny wise and pound foolish by purchasing non-rechargeable batteries, so now I only buy the rechargeable. They really are high capacity batteries.I’ve dabbled with other brands of rechargeable batteries, but have found that these not only last the longest, but seem to recharge quicker. In the long run, they’re not only more economical, but better on the environment. The packaging is mostly cardboard, except for the plastic shrink wrap.  The plastic uses recycle code 1 which is purportedly one of the safer and easier to recycle categories of plastic.All in all, I’m very happy with these batteries.  BTW, I’ve been recharging the batteries using the  EBL Smart 8 Bay AA AAA battery recharger ( https://amzn.to/2Vy1NyJ ) and couldn’t be happier.\n",
      "Work Great in Flash I bought these to use in my camera’s flash. Can’t believe how much better they work than alkaline. They last quite a bit longer. I haven’t cycled through them a whole lot yet, but it sure is nice not having to buy bricks of alkaline batteries at Costco. I think I’ll buy more to use in our LED candles and remote controls.\n",
      "Great item So far these are just as good as name brand without the outrageous cost\n",
      "They Make Stuff Turn On Word on the street is these are the same as Panasonic Eneloops in a different wrapper for a cheaper price.\n",
      "It works I am not sure what remote control has to do with this product...but they work great.\n",
      "No more buying batteries! Holds charge ad it should.\n",
      "Long lasting. Nice to have fully charged and ready to switch when necessary.\n",
      "excellent product These batteries are made in Japan  ,  high quality product , worth every penny .\n",
      "Great rechargable batteries Great rechargable batteries! They have great capacity and work great in everything I use them in!\n",
      "Good price for rechargeable So far so good, haven't had to recharge them which is nice but possible update in the future.\n",
      "Ok Ok\n",
      "Good batteries. Even though they come charged you really need to charge them when they arrive. Bought these for a flashlight that goes through regular batteries in a few weeks. Re chargeable batteries saved me.\n",
      "Slightly too big While they may last a while they don't fit into some items. I have a flashlight that they just don't slide in or out. Some toys I have also found out that they just don't fit\n",
      "Short lifespan I've already had 3 batteries fail to charge while some older Eneloops are still going strong. Avoid these batteries!\n",
      "works as described bought to replace older energizer batteries that where not holding a charge, and they seem to be just as good,\n",
      "These are repackaged eneloops Last a long time in my Xbox controllers.\n",
      "Won’t charge fully. Can’t get them to charge all the ways. Had them on charger for about 36 hours and still doesn’t read fully charged. Even after that long of a charge they only work for about 2 hours in a computer mouse.\n",
      "So far so good So far so good\n",
      "Chinese-made For several years I've purchased and used Amazon Basics 2400 mah AA rechargable batteries and have been more than satisfied with them. HOWEVER, today I received my latest order of what was sold as the same battery and found they were made in China rather than Japan. I've had Chinese-made 2400 mah AA rechargable batteries in the past -- they would not hold a charge and were lousy batteries. So, the set I received today are the last Amazon Basics that I'll purchase.\n",
      "Great Great\n",
      "A bit of a full-charge problem I use these constantly in LED mini-lights and the charge lasts for a good length on on-time.I did have a bit of a problem with some new cells not charging completely.  I ordered another batch, picked out good cells for a completely good set, and did a return... as there is no way to exchange a sub-set.\n",
      "These precharged AAA batteries are exactly what we needed. The package came quickly at a time when we thought our wireless headphones needed new rechargeable AAA batteries.  They worked immediately to get the remote headphones working - but we found out that the charging base of the wireless headphones (also bought from through Amazon) was no longer charging anything (its GREEN light was no longer lit).  With the 8 battery package, we have time to either buy a charging unit or get resolution from the provider of the wireless headphones.  So far, so good.\n",
      "Batteries too wide These batteries are just a hair wider than a normal AA, which makes no sense to me.  I have a wireless remote alarm device that requires 4 AA batteries and these 4 batteries will not fit in the device.  It is a tight compartment, but 4 Duracell rechargeables fit just fine.  You'd think there would be a requirement that they meet a certain size specification.\n",
      "so so Unremarkable performanceWill not buy it a 2nd time\n",
      "Very good batteries. These are great batteries. Hold a charge very well and last pretty long. I used them in an LED Boa at festivals and they lasted close to 8 hours.\n",
      "Pre-Charged? We purchased the batteries for the office. I selected the pre-charged batteries to avoid having to charge them since I needed them right away. I opened the pack and wasted an hour thinking my label maker was dying out when in reality the pre-charged batteries were actually not even charged at all. Not happy,\n",
      "They did the trick Great\n",
      "Wonderful Great product!\n",
      "Great batteries at a great price These have been working great. My kids go through more batteries then underwear so we need to use rechargeable batteries to help save money and the environment.  These were a great price and we are very happy with them. We have been using them constantly for about 2 months and they are still going strong.\n",
      "Great value Exceeds expectations\n",
      "Wish they lasted longer. Wish they lasted longer. Regular batteries last twice as long.\n",
      "Great batteries for the price! Great product the batteries have a great use span best rechargeable batteries for the price\n",
      "Value cannot be overstated Been using them forever now, in all kinds of devices. Best maintenance of maximum charge I've ever experienced with rechargeables. Compared brand new to brand new Duracells, and found that the Amazon Basics held a charge for longer. Blown away.\n",
      "Chinese junk These are now chinese garbage, not the relabeled made in Japan enloop xxx I purchased last time. I would avoid these and buy enloops is you want a quality cell.\n",
      "High capacity grey with green band is now made in China High capacity battery  nimh 2400mAh. Grey with green band is now made in China. I know there has been many discussions that said these were the ones from japan.  Lets see how these last\n",
      "Voltage Drop but Good Encountered notable voltage drop.  Batteries are fine for electronics but not for small mechanical devices.  Otherwise, they are a great but inexpensive battery.  You should probably purchase them, depending on your use case. Note - I usually purchase batteries by the case load for commercial applications.\n",
      "Easy to use Easy to use\n",
      "TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE Immediately returning. No charge whatsoever. I'm wary of charging them as I've seen reviews of them being ruined and destroying the charger. Taking them to UPS in the morning!\n",
      "these charge up and light up our little solar path lights until morning! In the rating their is a question on remote control.....am I missing something?These cost more than 2x the going rate, but so far they are worth it!!!Don't know the full picture until some time goes by.  Usually our solar batteries last for years.Will I re post then?  We will seeeeeee!\n",
      "Long Lasting I’ve used these batteries for years and won’t use anything else. They work great and hold a charge for longer than most batteries. The recharge time is also fast.\n",
      "Don't like it Not worth the price does not last when recharged\n",
      "Made in China Last time I purchased this item, the batteries were made in Japan.  This time, they are labelled made in China and I'm not sure if they will hold up to the product specs for low self discharge and charge cycles:Purchased Sept 2019ASIN B00HZV9WTMAA high capacity rechargeable 8 pack\n",
      "Good product! Great price.\n",
      "Happy with them. Just got them so far so good.\n",
      "Good value Works wrll\n",
      "Really holds a charge I moved to get the house completely on rechargeable batteries.  I charge them all, then put them away until needed.  These last when used, and store their charge when put away.\n",
      "Works great I bought these batteries for my remote controls and they work great\n",
      "love it I think they are rebadged Eneloop batteries. (At least they are as good as my Eneloops)\n",
      ":( These used to be made in Japan but these recent batch are all made in China... :(\n",
      "Great value We love these batteries. Really great value for the price.\n",
      "Now Made in China, Still Priced like Made in Japan Have bought the high-capacity Amazon batteries many times over the years.  Very good quality, made-in-Japan batteries.  They are now made in China using a slightly different label.  Website still shows label used when they were made in Japan.\n",
      "Great product Great product\n",
      "Dont buy it This batteries burned out  my 100 dollars flashlight. They're dangerous and i will not out them in any kids toys\n",
      "extremely satisfied long life and dependable\n",
      "Great value. These batteries seems to work as advertised so far.  Haven't had them long enough to accurately measure their capacity, in relation to the claimed capacity, or their shelf life.  However, for the price, it's a great value.\n",
      "Five star INCREDIBLE !!!!! Five star\n",
      "Some went dead after 1st charge! I already have two double A batteries that will not charge anymore, after only one use. Seriously doubting the quality and will likely get a non-Amazon brand next time.\n",
      "useless batteries Every battery in this purchase could not hold a charge and was completely.Please send me information on how to return them.  Better yet, I will toss the and you can credit my account.I will now search for other batteries which I need immediately for my phones. J.  Casasanto\n",
      "Fully Charged/Ready for Use I really like that these batteries come fully charged and ready for use.  Since they are rechargeable they will save money over the long term.\n",
      "They are durable For my small electronics at home\n",
      "Does not hold a charge! Does not hold a charge!\n",
      "Works well in Panasonic wireless phone Model KXTGA410 Original Panasonic batteries finally would not hold a charge after 9years (guesstimate). I replaced the originals with these batteries right out of the box (did not charge them)and they are still holding a charge 7 days later. I have three handsets and they all appear at the same charge level. The original batteries from Panasonic are spec’d for 6 days standby time and these have exceeded it. Very satisfied. To soon to comment  about longevity\n",
      "Don't last as long as previous rechareables I've owned at same mAh. In multiple devices don't last long and need frequent recharging.\n",
      "These things work as expected I like the quality Rechargeable batteries are always the best\n",
      "good battery used it for toys, perfect.\n",
      "The worst rechargeable battery ever. I've had rechargeable batteries for years-using mainly in cameras-but these are the worst. Not only did they not hold a charge long, but they stopped charging altogether after 6 months. Would not buy again.\n",
      "Rechargable I am trying to be more environmentally friendly to our planet.  Using rechargeable batteries is energy efficient and  reduces the amount of dangerous waste going into our landfills.\n",
      "just received just started to use, so can't rate longevity\n",
      "Satisfied Great product\n",
      "Solid battery Yep. It was what it said.\n",
      "Good$ Good\n",
      "As Expected I didn't really get a chance to use them so much yet. Will update if not working as expected.\n",
      "The only rechargeables we buy now. Amazon basics are great especially the batteries and cables. These last longer than other brands I have used before they burn out and you get twice as many for the same price. All of our gaming controllers, remotes, headphones anything that takes AA and AAA batteries is powered with these.\n",
      "Don't buy! Wasted my money. Garbage.\n",
      "Value for money Could last a bit longer but hey, great value for money.\n",
      "Decent price There are decent for the money, they work for me and have decent battery life. The catch is that when you have all four batteries charging at the same time, the charger makes a strange buzzing noise, when looked into other customers have bad this problem bit mine are still working fine. The battery could have been sealed a little better though I've noticed tears on the wrapping from taking them in and out of the charger.\n",
      "Great batteries The batteries are performing as advertised. It was a good buying compared to retail locations.\n",
      "As expected As expected\n",
      "are you kidding me I have a wireless keyboard at work and the AA's fully charged lasted a day.  Came to work this morning and had to recharge them. Using my wired keyboard today.  Words cannot express the unhappiness\n",
      "Don’t last long 2 batteries failed after 10 months. They will no longer take a charge.\n",
      "Too large of battery 3 stars for now.  Depleted initial charge, recharged with appropriate charger, now using in automatic candles.  Pretty sure it's not my candles, as it's never been an issue before, but I think these batteries are just a little bit bigger than your average AA.  I can't place the battery cover over the bottom of my candles.\n",
      "It was what it was supposed to be not else you can say then this\n",
      "High quality Great product:1- Can be used many times2- Reasonable price3- Last for a long time4- High quality\n",
      "Disappointed that these are made in China Will always rely on the inherent quality and reputation of my previous purchases that were made in Japan. The oldest set was back on 07/2015 but are slowly being sent for recycling.\n",
      "LOVE AMAZON BATTERIES! Amazon offers some of the best batteries on the market for it's value. I got these while on sale and they've been powering my electronics over and over. The fact that they are rechargeable is great and I feel confident that these will last. I bought a number of these years ago and they just recently slowed down in terms of charge, but still work pretty well. Would highly recommend these.\n",
      "literally useless At 1.2V instead of a 1.5V for normal AA BATTERIES, those are literally useless.  My device won’t work with it at all\n",
      "Cheap Rechargeable NiMh Still searching for rechargeable NiMh batteries which deliver excellent performance.  These don't make the cut.  Discharge too quickly compared to other brands.\n",
      "Great product Long battery life definitely will repurchase and recommend this for everyone\n",
      "As advertised. As advertised.\n",
      "Made in China :-( So mad these are from china. My previous  Amazon high capacity batteries were made in Japan and the quality was much better.\n",
      "your batteries quality is a mess and terrible your batteries quality is a mess and terrible.i almost fired my house because amazon basics battery.i have used your battery for my wall clock not in charging adapter.the battery is melted down with bad smell.i discarded all your batteries because fear of fire\n",
      "You must get the exact match as in the original Recently purchased these batteries for my church's hand held microphones.  They worked and I've recharged them and they still work.  Trying to get a handle how long the charge lasts before recharging.  Too soon to tell right now.\n",
      "Great for outdoor walkway lights I use these batteries in my outdoor walkway lights.  They are recharged every day through solar power.  The previous lower capacity batteries I used would run out within a couple hours of darkness.  These generally power the lights throughout the entire night.  Very pleased.\n",
      "This is the second time I've ordered these The first set of these lasted my boys for about a year; which is really saying something given how much use they get. They're used in xbox one controllers...constantly.  The boys were happy with the longevity of a single charge and I was pleased with the overall life span of the batteries.\n",
      "Be careful when recharging On our first charging cycle, one of the batteries got extremely hot and started to disintegrate while on the the charger.\n",
      "These batteries don't last These batteries are supposed to be rechargeable, but they don't recharge reliably or hold a charge. Even when used in low-intensity devices like flashlights, they only last a short time. I had rechargeable batteries 25 years ago that lasted longer than these do. What a waste of money.\n",
      "Good buy Great for all the kid's electronics\n",
      "Unpredictable Quality Each Purchase It’s a hit and miss. Bought them once and they were green and gray and were awesome. Last two batches were orange with same capacity and are complete junk.  Last about fifteen minutes in an Xbox controller. First batch lasted weeks.\n",
      "Great product My husband  likes them and usesThem saves money.\n",
      "BEST VALUE!!! These are awesome batteries! Hold charge, charge quickly and keep on working!!!\n",

      "Great price Been using them for months now.  Charge every week.  Feel like new.\n",
      "Simply: great batteries I would love to tell you how long these batteries last but I have had them in my tv remote for months since I bought them and they have yet to die on me! These are definitely not just store brand batteries.\n",
      "Good value Good value\n",
      "Better value than Sam's or BJ's Club prices Standard AAA alkaline batteries seems to work just fine. No complaints.\n",
      "Prone to Overcharging! Product worked well for the first 2 months but then the battery following those months instead of a 4-5 day battery life it dropped to barley 1 day (Note: Batteries were used for an Xbox One Controller) It was probably my fault for leaving it on the charger for longer than needed or just natural decay of the battery over time due multiple recharges and discharges but that shows how cheap the materials in the battery are and the only really good thing about the product is the price!\n",
      "Better than any other solar battery! outside solar lights last forever!\n",
      "Half went bad The price seems good however half of them went bad after the first charge\n",

      "Great batteries Got these to replace my 2 year old rechargeable batteries in my outdoor solar lighting.  What a difference!  Good product and great value for the money.  Can't go wrong with these!\n",
      "It''s worth of money Hooray!  Geat batteries! I like they have unexpected capacity of the stored electricity. I use it im my portable  radio. A designer and the manufacturer should be  highly praised. I will recommend everybody to use this type of rechargeable batteries.\n",
      "Do you love rechargeable batteries? Wish I had started buying rechargeable batteries years ago. No more running to the store when something goes dead.\n",
      "Sub-standard quality I've had a ridiculously high failure rate on these. I've had to return them several times. Sometimes, batteries won't hold a charge right out of the box. My charger is also Amazon Basics, so you'd think...I have switched to a competing brand.\n",
      "Not precharged The ad clearly says precharged. I hadn't yet gotten a charger yet for them. I bought them for an approaching hurricane and when I got them which was a day later than they said when I ordered them, they were not charged. I had to run out again and try to locate batteries! Don't say precharged if they are not.\n",
      "Cheap and Long-Lasting These are much cheaper than name brand and seem to hold a charge many more times.\n",

What I got are white.2) The images show \"Made in Japan\", these show \"Made in China\"Sure, \"packaging may vary\", but the location where they are made should not.For comparison, I also attached an image of AA versions, ordered from this _same_ page (but on Prime Now).AA:ASIN: B00HZV9WTMModel number: HR-3UTHA-AMZN (8P)Date first listed on Amazon: September 21, 2013AAA:ASIN: B00HZV9YE0Model number: HR-4UTHA-AMZN (8P)Date first listed on Amazon: July 1, 2019\n",

      "Made in China... not Japan like previous orders Just received a new batch.  Noticed the battery had a different feel than usual.  Also noticed the green stripe at the top was larger.  After that, I noticed that they were made in China this time.... not Japan.  So, only time will tell, but clearly not an Eneloop equivalent.\n",
      "Amazon rechargeable batteries This is the worst item that I have bought in recent months. This product is worthless. It came partly charged. After the initial charge had run down, I charged it to hundred percent I used on my trash can for a couple of hours and it went straight to 0% and thereafter refused to be charged. My advice: this battery is a waste of money.\n",

      "These exploded in two devices! This is not the only package of AAA batteries that I purchased, but this last package in particular ruined two devices. The first was a small motion sensor light in a closet. I heard a *POP* and went into the closet and the light had blown off the wall base and popped the SCREW ON battery compartment cover of the light off. There was a white residue all over the end of the battery and inside the light. The second device was a remote control for a speaker that stopped working and when I took the batteries out to charge them, I saw the same white residue. Neither device will work with other batteries now either, they are both dead and I'm out replacements as well as additional rechargeable batteries. DO NOT BUY!!\n",

      "Good value for heavy AA users I ordered more after testing. I use them to power wireless microphones for film'video shoots. They need to last 6-8 hours like regular AAs. It gets expensive replacing 16 or more per day, so rechargeable is better value if equal performance.\n",

I tried a set of Duracell rechargeable batteries but they would only go for a couple of weeks.  I finally decided to gives these batteries a go and they have been great.I installed them on July 7th and as of today, August 3rd, they are still going strong.So, if you have a Keyless deadbolt that is eating batteries gives these a try.  I'm buying a second set right now :)\n",

      "Good deal but major caveat... From the looks of the other reviews, these batteries change from time to time.  Mine are the currenlty pictured ones with grey sides and green highlights at the ends.  I knocked two stars off because they are ever so slightly bigger than a standard AA alkaline battery.  This matters when fitting them and removing them from my charger, and worse, they are REALLY hard to get in/out of certain devices I have (which fit standard AA alkaline batteries perfectly).  Keep that in mind when considering these if your alkaline batteries fit snugly into your device.  The batteries do work and they seem to hold a charge well when charged with my better-than-average charger.  The AAA version of these seem to have the same \"slightly too big\" problem as well.  Despite the caveat, I think this is a good deal for 8 rechargeable batteries (and the AAA 8-packs) and I'm using them in quite a few devices with success.\n",

      "Amazon bait and switch - avoid China made not Japan as photo shows As a prime member I've been buying Amazon basics batteries for quite some time and the batteries themselves have AWLAYS matched the description and the photos until now. The last two orders have been different from the photos and are not longer made in Japan (as one of the photos show) but China. Worse the design of the battery has also changed (again different than photos) and the positive lug is shorter and doesn't always make good contact. Lastly the performance isn't as good either. I understand \"packaging may vary\" and I'm okay with the packaging looking different but NOT the battery itself, how / where its made and its performance. That is either bait and switch or now Amazon has a problem with its own batteries being counterfeit. I'm quite disappointed in Amazon and when I called to inform them of this they didn't even provide some sort of courtesy compensation or explanation. Time to go back to Eneloop batteries.\n",
      "Use in mice and remotes - seem to hold up well I use these in (2) Microsoft rechargeable mice and some Harmony remotes.  The batteries work well with the rechargeable plates for the mice and charge well in a standard recharge plug in.  Have been using them for months and see no issues so far.\n",

      "Cheaper alternative for eneloop We use to exclusively buy eneloop rechargeable batteries, however, after having our daughter and the amount of things that required batteries, we started to look at cheaper options. Took a chance on the amazon brand and haven’t looked back.\n",

      "OK for average use but inadequate for professional photography I'm a wedding photographer and have used eneloops for years.  I've been very happy with the Panasonic Eneloop Pro but thought I'd give these Amazon Basics a try because of the price.  They worked fine in the prep shots were there was a several second pause between flashes.  During other portions of a wedding, however,  I found that the flash didn't recharge quickly enough and about about 50% of the shots of the wedding party walking down the aisle the flash didn't fire.  Very disappointing.  It also seemed to run out of juice a little sooner than the Panasonic Eneloop Pro.  All of this is just anecdotal and I don't really have the ability to perform scientific tests but my experience has been below expectations for professional use.  For the average family user, I think they would probably work great and you can't beat the price.Best of luck!\n",

None of the batteries lasted longer than 10 minutes tops after charging for over 8 hours each. Took the batteries back to my charger, discharged all of them and attempted to charge them again over the course of a 24 hour period. Still none of the batteries would last more than a few minutes. Lather, rinse and repeat this process for almost a week, forget it. Don't waste your money on these, buy a reputable brand instead.\n",
      "Excellent NIMH battery I had a bunch of another brand, and about a year after buying them, they started to die on me.  I go out at nite a lot, and tend to use my headlamp a lot. So I tend to be an extreme user of  rechargeable batteries. But with the current set nearing their charge limit, I was kinda stunned. They lasted just a year. I have other brands that have lasted years longer. So I wasn't going back to buy that brand. They should last more then a year, even at my rate of usage. So I got this time  Amazon branded NiMH batteries. They are made in Japan. They are sent to you as nearly as I can tell fully changed, or very near it. My smart charger immediately kicked them back as ready to go. They produce a lot of power, and they tend to keep going for a long time before they need recharged. All pro's. In fact, from a power output, to a longevity of the battery, I really can't tell any difference between these and the top (expensive) name brands. And they are a fraction of the cost. I haven't had them long enough to judge durability. But in the initial charges, they all work out to the same amount of time in my potent Cree powered headlamp (it sucks power like there's no tomorow lol).  My only complaint here is it's TOUGH getting them out of their plastic shrink wrap. If you don't have a tool, you better have some pretty strong fingers. However, that's not worth a star. But be warned, that shrink wrap is not easy to break open.  But other then that, the batteries are just as good as the top name brands. And they are solar charged. Can't beat that.\n",
      "Great product Great product, worth every penny. I will be saving a lot of money now buying battery for my computer mouse and tv controls.\n",
      "They do not hold their power I purchased these for my MAC computer keypad, mouse and track pad.  They do not hold their charge.  I am replacing them every other day.  These are not high capacity batteries.  Very disappointing.  Stick to the name brands!\n",
      "none of these were pre charged I really needed these to be ready to go out of the box and spent a bunch of time trying to figure out why the device I put it in wouldn't work.  How long could these batteries been lying around for them to have died?\n",

      "Not pre-charged These did not come pre-charged as  advertised and after 9 hours on the charger still aren't charged.  Very disappointing.\n",
      "Charge does not last long These charge pretty fast, but do not last long in gaming controllers. Just had to change them out pretty often.\n",

      "These Batteries show fully charged but do NOT work Bought these for use in little lanterns.  Charged them, put them in the lantern, nothing. Put the old batteries back in and it worked, so I know it's not the device.  Read the directions for the batteries, discharged and charged them a few times and still nothing. Still show as fully charged, still do not work.  Just tried to go through the return process and there apparently is none for batteries.  I have ordered batteries before, this is the first time I've received ones that are bunk. But would be nice to get an exchange for ones that actually work.\n",

      "Great for everyday use Work great! Very easy to use and still are using them daily.\n",
      "Not great compared to regular AA batteries I am making a comparison with these batteries compared to other rechargeables I own (18650 various brands) and Duracell's Procell (non-rechargeable) that I normally use.I am using a nitecore charger to charge my batteries. It is compatible with various types of batteries, the 18650 and AA's in particular.The device I am using these in is my bluetooth controllers for my Windows Mixed Reality headset.The only reason I bought these batteries for my two controllers (two AA each) is because the procell's I've been using only lasts two days and I thought that was terrible. Well, these are worse. And might be even worse depending on how long they last until they can't charge anymore due to the how often I got to charge them.So here are my cons:1) Longevity of the charge. It is very short, don't even last 3 hours of constant use until the batteries die. The procell's I normally use last me two days of use. Comparing it to my LG 18650 batteries (which are 3000mAh) which are used in vape products, and my cree led flashlight, which seem to last week at high usage. The 18650's are high discharge batteries, so I'm not sure if these Amazon AA's are with that comparison.2) Cost, due to longevity and other batteries I use, these are the most expensive per life of a charge. I bought the 8 pack due to I need 4 for my controllers (2 each) and then another 4 ready to go.3) Heat. Normally if you batteries get hot during, or during charging, then that is a really bad thing. The 18650 batteries have a chance to explode. So I'm not sure if these will get to that point too, but during use they are getting warm to the touch. During charging almost too hot to handle.The batteries do say \"Made in japan\" printed on the label, which was the only reason I bought them.I'll need to buy some other AA Ni-MH to compare with, but for now I am not impressed and won't be buying anymore of these from Amazon.\n",
      "50% failure rate after 3 months Bought a large amount of Amazon rechargeable batteries earlier this year for some pantry motion lights I'm using. After 3 months I've had to throw out about half of them as they will not charge and are showing DEAD/REPLACE on my battery tester. Using a higher-end charging station designed for these battery types. Would not recommend for long use. Buy a brand name for better value.\n",
      "Great product so far! Seems to be really good.  Kids use them in their game controllers.\n",
      "Great value for the price We use these in the remote mics at church.\n",

      "The batteries do not hold I trust the name Amazon so that I did not hesitate to buy this item. I had them fully charged and used one in my flashlight. The flashlight did not give a full brightness and then flickered as if the battery was about to drain so I replaced another battery from the same lot. The same thing happened so I know this is the quality of the batteries. Do not buy this. Now I am really disappointed.\n",
      "Work well As advertised\n",
      "Did not last I would not recommend these batteries. They lasted just over a year. I think I bought 4 and 2 of them already went bad (gave an error when trying to charge). They also starting “flaking” metal from the bottom part of the batteries.  So far the Panasonic “eneloop” batteries have lasted much longer\n",

      "Does hold charge over a month !!! I bought two boxes  of this battery and fully charged each. Needed 12 batteries for my 2-way radios. Today after only a month all 12 batteries was discharged.

      "A+ They do everything you expect a battery to do.\n",
      "Too many issues I bought these for game cameras.  Not a single set(8) out of 3 showed a full charge.  They all showed 50-60%.  I have older Amazon batteries that are still working great.  Unfortunately, the newer ones seem to have corrosion issues too.  Overall, I will be looking for a new brand.\n",
      "didnt last a year Bought these after a bad run with Eneloops, and the same thing happened with these. Well not exactly the same but close enough to try another brand.  Basically the Eneloops and Amazon AA were only usable for about a year of daily use. Today all 4 AA batteries are dead even after a full charge. I switched to rayovac since they have been giving me the best long term use.\n",

      "Can only buy them in 4 or 8 packs which is not good value These are very good batteries, but a very poor value. They cost $17.49 for an eight pack, (which is a price drop of over $2) which is about $2.19 a battery and put out an average of a little over 2450 mAh of current. Which is very good since they are rated at 2400 mAh. That is still only 1114 mAh per dollar.\n",

      "Used at a professional automotive shop 6 days a week. batteries only last about 2 hours if you're lucky. You constantly have to keep changing out batteries, while another set is charging. You end up destroying all your headlamps, and flashlights from opening and closing to change out battery three four times a day.\n",
      "Won’t recharge. Useless waste of money. Does not recharge in a standard Panasonic charger. I’m not buying a second charger just to see if these work, so I’m calling it a waste of $10.\n",

      "Recharged batteries do not last I have purchased these batteries before and they do a good job. Last batch I bought (April 2019) do not last after being properly charged. The last no more than a few hours. I tried returning them but the return window already closed so now I am stuck with them.\n",
      "Too many go BAD I've had these one year, and 20% have gone bad.  That is, when placed in a proper charger, it says, BAD and that is the end of that battery.  I bought the more expensive Eneloop batteries in 2017 (12), and not one of those have gone bad.\n",
      "Terrible product!! Originally bought 2 sets of these batteries(March 2017) thinking Amazon Basics would be a good choice. And I will say that for 5 months they did work well. Unfortunately, some of these started to sometimes fail in that they would no longer charge but I still thought 'okay, things happen' and contacted Amazon and got 8 replacements sent out in December 2017. We put those into use removing the 'bad' ones and we limped along for a few months. Within a few months we started seeing sporadic failures again to where I started to doubt the charger.I started doing research on the charger and rechargeable batteries in general and came across an article(sorry don't have the link) talking about the cells coming from China and those coming from Japan and of course how the ones from Japan are under stricter regulations about quality. At this point, I purchased a set of Panasonic Eneloop  batteries in April 2018 and still have all 16 in use with no issues charging as of this writing in June 2019!For anyone curious we are using these to power wireless mic transmitters in our church. We use 10(random) of the 16 on Sunday mornings for approximately 4hrs and then they go back on the charger and then we use 8(random) of the 16 on Thursday nights for rehearsal and they go back on the charger.\n",

I just wish I would have bought the charger to charge the other AA ones I purchased at the same time.It's the way to go for sure!!!Especially if you're using them in your children's toys.\n",

      "These are really pretty good. I was skeptical that these would be like the cheap Radio Shack batteries I was once sucked into buying. They didn't last at all but these are working out really well and they seem to hold their charge well when not being used.I use them in several devices around the house and I have more than twice as many as I need in the devices. So I charge the extras up and have them ready for when they are needed. Then I just swap an already charged set for the old set and charge the old ones. The charged cells can sit around for a month or more but do not seem to loose any significant charge while waiting. Very happy with these.\n",

      "AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries (8-Pack) 1 battery out of the 8 pack doesn't work. Not a good thing when you need a total of 8 batteries. The other 7 work great so far compared to the cheap ones that originally came with my outdoor solar lights. If all 8 had worked I would have given these batteries 5 stars, but the inconvenience of having to purchase another brand of rechargeable batteries  dropped it to a 3.\n",

The first time using the pre-charged batteries they seemed great, but then once they came to the end of that charge they seemed to last less and less each charge. I would say in the past 8 months they have only been \"re-charged\" a max of 10 times, where I also have energizer batteries. May seem like you're getting a deal but you're not, DON'T BUY!! Not worth it where you will just have to replace in a few months.\n",

A couple of years ago I bought a charger and set of rechargeable batteries and started using them  Then I started running out and having to use standard batteries. Then I ordered these so I don't have to wait for a set to charge.  Why?  Good alkalines last a long time but when they're dead that's it. Discard and buy more.  These batteries get changed out so I don't have to buy more batteries, I just recharge them.  So far, based on the cost of good alkalines, I've saved the cost of the charger and the batteries that I ordered with it. In another six chargings I'll have saved the cost of these batteries.  The math is unassailable and I get to keep the savings.  What's so bad about that?NOTE: Things like smoke alarms and other safety items should still get Alkalines since they are designed to use alkalines.  Otherwise, use rechargables: no waste, no \"Dead\" batteries when you need them, and best, no cost for replacement.  What's not to like?\n",

      "Good but not great. First of all these batteries do not arrive fully charged. It took me a full 2 hours in my re-charger to get them to 100% capacity. But once they were fully charged, they worked amazingly. I use these batteries primarily to boost the bandwidth on my computer. But alas, it only does the job for about 2 weeks before I needed to replace them to get my bandwidth back up to speed. I can see why re-chargeable batteries are recommended. The price of these batteries are very good and I hope to get a few years of use from them. Only time will tell.\n",

      "BUYER BEWARE, HAZARDOUS BATTERIES So because Amazon banned the sale of 18650, 3.7v batteries I had to resort to buying AAA batteries for my flashlights. Ever since I bought my first flashlight on here I've dealt with 18650 batteries (and trust me, I've bought many flashlights on here) but this is a first on me dealing with rechargable AAA batteries. I thought I would buy from Amazon basics because Amazon is reliable right? WRONG!I unboxed these and within 10 seconds of me putting them in the battery holder, the light itself didn't turn on so I started troubleshooting and as soon as I touched the batteries to bring them out, I burned my finger and what followed was a smell of burst batteries. I recognize the smell because a year ago I had a portable power bank that had burst and filled my room with a terrible chemical smell. Anyways, I also noticed some smoke coming from the batteries and soon realized what had happened. The batteries got so hot that they melted the plastic part of the battery holder. Needless to say I'm very disappointed because I thought these were going to be good rechargable batteries and wow, I got burned. Literally. What really gets on my nerves is that Amazon doesn't have a button anywhere which allows me to contact the seller or anything. So here I am, writing this review in hopes that they see this and contact meBUYER BEWARE OF THESE HAZARDOUS BATTERIES\n",

      "Used some for over a year now as a photographer. No issues Someone here said the Amazon AA High-caps were basically the Eneloop batteries repackaged/rebranded. Not really sure about that but I've used mine for well over a year in my camera flashes and they've been very reliable. The older ones don't hold as much of a charge and but that's understandable, as long as I full charge a set of 4 batteries I can get through a 100~ 150 full powered shots even after a year. I've brought more to phase out older ones.\n",

      "Not that good on battery life sorry. I use these in a thermostat and they are very short-lived batteries. One battery will be full charged the second is dead all the time. So I just let it go as long as I can still see the display.\n",
      "Not Good Batteries - I wouldn't buy them again I dont usually write reviews anymore because I am always suspicious of bad reviews, however I have had several brands of rechargeable AA batteries and these batteries from Amazon did not stand the test of time. Some were dead within days, others lasted only a few weeks, and now after 6 months there are two left out of a pack of 12. That should give you and idea. I use them primarily for battery powered candles. There are other brands out there so read the reviews and you will find them, but like anything it is a learning curve.\n",

      "Long Lasting batteries My normal, but older Eneloops only lasted like a week or week and a half in my Xbox controller. These last me 3-4 weeks. I would recommend these over the Xbox play and charge kit because you can just quickly swap out the batteries, charge the used ones, and not have to deal with charging cable. They also last longer, are cheaper, and are simple to replace.\n",
      "Best rechargeable battery for the price These batteries are great.  I use them in a flashlight and I’ve probably put them through about 15 recharge cycles.  Great battery for the price\n",

      "Love these! If you're on the fence about rechargable batteries take the plunge! I've had the name brand and the Amazon brand and these work just as great as the name brand ones. We've had the same ones for years, and hold a charge well, plus work in all our stuff. Wii removes, computer mouse, headphones. Love them!\n",

      "Horrible battery life! Horrible battery life! These things drain much quicker than the 6 year old Energizer rechargeable I still use. I know they have high capacity versions, maybe those are more up to par but I would stay away from these and go with another brand.\n",
      "So far so good These are a good value and compatible with my existing charger. I haven't had them long enough to determine their long-term longevity though.\n",
      "Great replacement batteries for solar lights. Bought to replace the batteries in my solar path way lights. Works perfectly, saved me money.\n",
      "Better than they first appeared For the first day, three of the eight batteries were dead and would not charge, regardless of the charger or position within a multi-battery charger. But on the second day, they charged! All three of them. Not sure what the story is here, but they appear to be as fully charged as the others. In general, experience of these has been very good.\n",

      "Camera For my flash cycle time better!!\n",
      "Inexpensive for what you get out of them. These batteries are very useful for my Xbox One controller. Had these 4 batteries since 2016 and they are still work well.\n",
      "powerful and long-lasting Very powerful and long-lasting batteries! My camera flash recharges very quickly with these.\n",
      "Bad Batch- wont hold a charge I purchased these rechargeable batteries from amazon for my external camera flash, as I had a trip out of the the country and needed flash for nighttime photography. I charged the batteries according to the guide and when I loaded them into my flash it says low battery and shuts off. I have never used the batteries before this and they were fully charged It seems like i got a bad batch , I tried returning them to amazon but they are saying its past the return window. I would love for an Amazon rep to replace the batteries because I never got to use them.\n",
      "Amazon search is AWFUL I am giving this a 1 star because these are not Lithium Ion 18650 batteries. I typed a 5 digit number in the search bar: 18650. And these showed up in the the first few results! WHY? I did not use the word batteries. Or rechargeable. So much crap I am not looking for always shows up in the search results.\n",
      "Great money saver in the long run. Use them on my Switch controller mostly, pretty good better than alkaline batteries and rechargeable.\n",
      "What a rip-off These batteries are 1.2 volts.  Standard AA and AAA batteries have always been 1.5 volts.  If you are in series with two or three batteries then you are starting off at low voltage.  Electronics that require minimum voltages to run will not work or not work very quickly as the voltage goes down.  It seems that many of the brands' batteries are lower voltage.\n",
      "Worth the money Good batteries I would buy again\n",
      "Work as described It is great to have rechargeable batteries. I no longer have to worry about how I am going to discard batteries.\n",
      "The batteries would not work at all. I bought sixteen batteries because the reviews looked good.  When they arrived nearly half did not work. I thought they just needed sunshine to recharge them. After three days of sunshine they still do not work. Total waste of money.  The only reason I gave one star was because there was no option for zero stars.\n",
      "Work as advertised Ive been using them with another brand of battery charger from CVS pharmacy (the product advertised against this) but theyve been working great so far. Ive been using them with my xbox 360 controllers and they last pretty long. Im not sure how much a charge lasts because I usually always just put them back on the charger after a day of use jsut to be safe\n",

      "Bigger around Bigger around then other batterys of the AA size so wont fit in some flashlight there not alot bigger but enough they wont fit\n",
      "These batteries die more than Game of Thrones characters. These batteries last a week or two in a computer mouse in between charges. Very disappointed.\n",
      "definitely recommend these! My kids were burning thru tons of batteries with the xbox - I'm a tree hugger and it was killing me.  These work very well and we never run out.\n",
      "Well made rechargable batteries These are good rechargable batteries. Seem to hold a charge for a good time. I've used them quite a bit, and would purchase them again.\n",
      "Volume deal! Great price fantastic value for the number of batteries you get. Local pricing was way higher!\n",

      "They charge Xbox controllers! Bought this for Xbox one controller. I used to use the battery packs that you could buy from Microsoft or 3rd party. These seem like a much better alternative I purchased the Amazon wall charger as well\n",
      "Great product, good price Great product, good price\n",
      "I bought more of them! I use them at school for wireless microphones which normally eat through batteries in hours. These last for the whole event and longer.\n",
      "Product worked as expected. Product worked as expected.\n",
      "They work fine but capacity is less than expected. Eneloop or energizer rechargeables are still considerably better.\n",
      "Good buy They work perfectly as replacement batteries for our outdoor solar lights.\n",
      "Nope. I won't buy these again. They just don't last very long. And after about 7-8 recharges, they don't last at all.\n",
      "Batteries dont recharge All four batteries came with a little bit of charge which was good. Once the batteries were fully depleted I put them in the charger (also Amazon brand). When I first put them in the indicator light was red, as it should be since the charge was depleted. Once the indicator light turned green I assumed it was fully charge but it was not. It had no power to it at all. I put it back on to the charger and the light indicator was red. I have not had one successful charge. I've tried it in different t outlets to see if that may have been the issue but it was not. I am so disappointedUpdate: changed the outlet that was charging the batteries and now they have been charging. We will see how long they last.\n",
      "Solid batteries Great longevity and price.\n",

      "As described Have to recharge often\n",
      "2 MIA/Extremely Slow to Charge Two batteries were missing from my package of eight; one of the plastic-wrapped packs of four had been neatly slit open and two had been taken. Also, it takes over 3 days for these batteries to signal \"charged-to-capacity\" on my Energizer Charger.\n",
      "price great product\n",
      "Nope I have a Princeton Tec EOS headlamp I use for fishing and hunting. With the Eneloop batteries I can see 100 yards on high setting for a couple hours. Also when I recharge eneloops I can store them for weeks and they have a full charge when I use them. With these Amazon Basics I can see about 100 yards for about 20 minutes then drain out. I can fully charge these Amazon Basics and store them for 1 week and when I go to use them they don't hold a charge worth a dang.\n",
      "pretty good as of the moment they last longer than eveready panasonic batteries etc that you could find in dollar stores. good buy\n",
      "Works great for the price These work great for the money\n",
      "Great replacement for my solar lights I am extremely happy with these batteries.  I was concerned about using them in my solar lights because the original batteries were 950mAH.  These are great and makes my lights work all night.  I would definitely recommend this batteries.\n",

      "Great price Wonderful\n",
      "4 dead after 1-year - watch the mR value. Still a good value. I bought an 8-pack of AA's in May of 2018.  My Zanflare charger consistently showed over 2500mAHrs.  I used 4 of them in my camera charging every month or so.  They worked great in my camera - longest lasting rechargeable I ever had.  The other 4 were used in a radio which I used daily.  I charged the batteries every other day, so maybe 150 charges.You can see the difference between the two sets in my photo.  The camera set shows that the mR (battery internal resistance) value after 1-year as 65mOhm, which the value when the batteries are new.  The set that I used in the radio (and charged frequently) shows a value of 148-644 mOhms all the recharges.  That set had trouble powering the radio with those high mR value - sometimes it could not turn on.  The batteries have a 1-year warranty and amazon honored the warranty by replacing all 8 batteries.I also have a set of AAA's which I use in my remote controls and have had no issues with them at all.I am still giving these batteries 4 stars because 1) the capacity was great, 2) they were still a good value compared to alkalines even if I would have had to replace them 3) Amazon honored their warranty, so I have 8 new batteries.Bottom line.  I will continue to buy these batteries.  I recommend you use a charger that displays the mR value so you can monitor the battery health.  If you have issues, return them for replacement before the 1-year expires.\n",

      "Disappointed. I bought these Amazon Basics to replace Duracell rechargeable batteries which lasted ten years. Their only use was for Xbox controllers. Within a couple of months, the controller would randomly lose connectivity to the Xbox even though the batteries were just fully charged.I have since controlled for using a headset vs. not, tried these batteries in four different controllers, and connected the controllers to two different Xbox's...all resulting in the same issue. I've tested normal batteries in those same controllers and had no problems.\n",
      "Good price - not as effective as our Duracells. We have horses with limited electricity in the barn so we use headlamps for tending to them at night. After charging the batteries the output is comparable to the Duracells we've been using. A few 20 minute uses and they seem to lose about 50% of their power and our lamps operate like they've been set to LOW.  They do seem to hold a charge for good length of time however.\n",
      "Great Purchase! I use these for my XBox One controller and for the wifes Roku Premiere remote. They last a long time and have a pair always waiting for replacement. Cheaper than in store and work just as well if not better. Time will tell how they hold up but currently work great!\n",
      "Description of pre charged batteries is false. Description says that these are \"pre charged\"  but once I installed these in my device only 1 bar on the battery status glowed and the device indicated that it will take 7 more hours to charge! Pretty deceptive .\n",
      "Good price for rechargeable Batteries Good price\n",

      "Thanks Good product\n",
      "Great batteries, keeps charge for long periods! We use these all the time in our home in fan/tv/ac unit remotes, battery operated candles, wireless mouse, etc. These batteries last for a long time between charges. We are blown away how long these batteries keep things going. Would buy again without a second thought!\n",
      "Good vaule Worth the price cant go wrong with Amazon\n",
      "Did not hold charge We bought to use for our daughters toys/leap pad and these do not hold a charge at all. We charged all of them and kept in a tub to have them ready and once we put them into her leap pad the low battery came up immediately... very disappointing..\n",

      "As good or better than traditional brands These batteries have performed just as well as common brand batteries of the same type and purpose. The cost is far more acceptable than the price of others. These have been primarily used in gaming controllers, with a few being used in toys. All have performed well and continue to recharge at full capacity.\n",

      "As good as Eneloops at a much better price I use these and some Eneloop Pro batteries in my underwater strobes, and purchased these to add a few more sets. They last as long as the Eneloop Pro batteries, use the same chargers, and hold a charge about the same. All in all I recommend these batteries.My one complaint is with Amazon's \"Frustration Free\" packaging. It looks great in the photos, the batteries in a small plain box that is easily recycled. But the batteries I received were all shrink wrapped in non-recyclable plastic inside the box. Not quite what I would consider to be Green packaging.\n",

I am a light user so I am not subjecting the batteries to the recharging process over and over.\n",

Soon as I got them I put them on my altar SV2 rocket charger and all 8 were fully chargedI put 4 in my plight wave headlamp and the other 4 into my other flashlights . Went for a night hike and used 3 lights total of 5 hours. The flashlights are LD05. Running both lights at mostly hi and turbo and medium. The batteries lasted the trip. Even when it finally stepped down and wouldn’t go to high I’d turn off the light or use it on low awhile then I could use turbo for a minute again for aaa batteries I’m satisfied. Seems close to my Eneloop pro aaa. I’ll be buying the AA version next to test.\n",

Threw them out because I was afraid it was a safety hazzard when put into the Amazon charger. Plus, the batteries got boiling hot when charging them. Very disappointed!!\n",

I can charge these to full power (nitecore D4) and they will be completely drained in 3 hours of just sitting on the counter top out of the charger. I didn't expect anything special from them, but I didn't think they would be completely useless either. I will be avoiding all Amazon basics products from here on out.\n"

The only thing that seems to have a short battery life is the mini twinkle lights that you get from Pier One.  Everything else works great.  I mainly use them in battery-operated candles and they seem to last for months.  The candles operate on a timer every night for 4 hours. The batteries quickly recharge.  These have great lasting power in almost all things I've used them in.\n",

Past experiences I found rechargeable batters did not work very well and had a low battery life.  These batteries worked great for me that I bought many more from Amazon.  I have recharged them many times without quality reducing.  I have saved money on not having to replace batteries.\n",
      "Worked great for a couple months or so, then stopped holding a charge Used these for my Xbox One controller for about two months, on and off. They started out great, lasting about two weeks before needing to be recharged. Then all of a sudden they started needing to be recharged daily, and now they wont even turn my controller on. I didn't start using the controller a crazy amount or anything like that either. Normal batteries work fine, so these just decided to stop holding a charge. Probably more worth it to just buy a pack of AA batteries for the price, wouldn't really recommend. May work fine for things that dont take much battery, such as a remote for a TV.\n",
      "Working very well for me. Meets the claimed capacities. Amazon basics items are usually of decent form and function.  These batteries are no exception.  Theres not a lot I can say about batteries.  These work well and meet the stated Mah capacities according to my tester.  That's really all I want out of a rechargeable battery.\n",

Sorry Amazon, I wanted these to work but they didn't.\n",

Its a good thing they are fairly cheap and rechargeable.  I put them on the charger overnight and the next day checked their status and they were only 3/4s charged.

      "Good with one glaring problem Overall these batteries seem like they are high quality. Most of my rechargeables are Eneloop batteries, these were purchased because they are a bit less expensive and I wanted to see how they worked. Others seem to have have good success based on the reviews. These were purchased initially for some led candles my wife purchased. The main problem I found with these batteries is that the positive terminal doesn't protrude far enough and depending on the device may not actually touch the terminal. This may also be a fault with the device's design but I have not experienced this with the Eneloop batteries and holding the batteries side by side there is a barely discernable difference. It is slight and I was able to remediate it by trimming the outer wrap from the battery but I'm not sure that is a good solution. As long as they work in your device they should perform well.\n",
      "Was not expecting a good battery Well these batteries appear to be quite good.  Put one in a phone that worked for over an hour when new and when it went down to 15 minutes replaced and now you can talk way over an hour and there is still have the bars left.  Very Impressive.  It will take time for word to get out but it will.....\n",

They saved me money overall and I will be purchasing another set for him.\n",

      "Extremly satisfied!! This was my first attempt at utilizing rechargeable batteries. I noticed right away a huge improvement how long these batteries last! Using standard batteries( you know, the kind you can buy in bulk at COSTCO) in my LED light I have in my shower. I had to replace these batteries every 2 to 3 weeks. I got tired and decided to try the Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries. I think I even noticed right away that the LED lights were brighter! These batteries lasted 7 weeks! I hear that I am going to loose some of this initial performance with subsequent charges. So far so Good!!\n",
      "Nice rechargeable batteries 1.2v and 800mAh. Reasonably priced and rechargeable.These batteries came indeed pre-charged so ready to be used. It is a nice plus.I have been using them for a while and I am not seeing anything to complain about.5 stars.\n",
      "Does not charge Does not hold the charge for more than a day or 2.\n",
      "Great quality batteries This is for the AAA 8 pack - batteries came pre-charged but the initial charge was low and they ran out of juice quickly. A normal charge was put on them, and they ran really well thru a charge/discharge cycle and run just as long as my enloops. I was told these are often the rebranded version of them anyway - I dont know for sure but they have the same battery life and quality so far.\n",

      "Only warrantied for a year - even if they fry and almost explode; buy a better brand! I purchased these 2017-09 and one of my batteries looked like it overheated and damn near melted, and it's 2019-03. Maybe I used them too much, maybe they are just not quality batteries, but the other 7 of my 8 pack are going strong.I called Amazon to let them know that my battery damn near exploded and they said there was nothing they could do about it because the 1 year warranty passed. Even after I talked to a supervisor, same thing. I just wanted a replacement battery, ya know, because Amazon should stand by their product...but they don't/won't.I think rechargeable batteries should last longer than 1.5 years. Amazon disagrees. So, I'm buying better batteries.\n",

I like to use the battery charged candles all year and thought this my solution.  Once the batteries require charging, they either don't charge at all ...

NiMH batteries back then were hit or miss sometimes you got a good batch sometimes they were bad out of the box.  Got to the point where I thought all rechargeables were simply junk.I have recently come back to rechargeable batteries for my every day carry Fenix E12 flashlight.These batteries appear to last forever,  they take and hold charge extremely well.  As the title states, i am truly a believer in rechargeable batteries thanks to these amazing Amazon Basics High Capacity batteries.They are also very reasonably priced in my opinion.\n",

Thus far I have had no issues with recharging them on a base I already own and they seem to be fairly durable. I use these in  in various electronics and toys and I found them to be cost effective as certain toys were quick battery drainers and I used to be out purchasing more until I made the switch to rechargeable.  The biggest cost outlay will be for the batteries and a charger but in the long run you definitely save money and reduce your carbon footprint too.\n",

      "Other companies make far better batteries With a capacity of only 850 mAh, I consider these batteries too inadequate for what they cost.  EBL and a few other companies make AAA Ni-MH with capacities of 1100 mAh (a 22% increase) with that cost only a little more than these.As with all rechargeable batteries, make sure you are using a good charger, one that you can adjust how quickly the batteries charge as well as give you a readout of the voltage of the battery as well as the actual number of mAh used to fully recharge the battery.  The Opus BT-C2400 has cords for both AC and DC charging but my favorite is the Opus BT-C2000 as it has adapters to allow charging of C & D size batteries in addition to AAA/AA.\n",

      "Duracell, Who? I got these because I was tired of replacing batteries in my Xbox controller. These usually last a solid couple of weeks before needing a charge. And, since it comes with multiple batteries, I can just switch them out and slap the others on the charger. They usually charge in a couple hours and work well!\n",

      "Powerful long lasting batteries These high capacity batteries are the real deal! I use these in a set of heated gloves. These eat up aa batteries so I decided to try rechargeable high capacity batteries. I am not disappointed. I use the gloves on my way to work in the morning for 30 minutes each day. After 5 days or 2 1/2 hours,  they are still working. Anything heated draws a lot of power but  Amazon's basics are up to the task. I charge them on the weekend for 6 hours and they're ready for another week. Best rechargeable batteries I've ever owned.\n",

      "Best Rechargeable Batteries I’ve Owned. First off, I’m reviewing the AmazonBasics High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries.I’ve owned  9v, AA, and AAA AmazonBasics High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries for about a year and a half and in that time I’ve had absolutely no issues whatsoever. I use a EBL–999 charger which charges all three types of batteries I’ve purchased from Amazon. I’ve used these batteries with several flashlights and various other electronic devices without any problems. I’m a musician and I also depend on the 9v’s for several effects pedals on my board when performing live music. It’s tough to explain what can happen at a live gig when your signal cuts out. Yeah, it’s obviously a disaster when something goes wrong that should never happen in this day and age, but leave it to live muaic to expose every weak link in an artist’s or band’s setup. In a word, it’s “chaos”.I am very happy to report that I’ve had zero issues with these batteries and they’ve paid for themselves a dozen times over – at a minimum.I highly recommend these AmazonBasics High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries to anyone looking to save money on batteries.My only regret is the coin I spent on batteries before I purchased these...what a grand waste of money it is to buy non–rechargeable batteries, whether you use them as often as I do or not. Any way you look at it, this is one purchase you’ll never regret.I cannot speak to the negative reviews here as I have yet to  experience anything of the sort.This is a fantastic product all around and I highly recommend it.\n",
      "Works well Powers the wireless mouse that i carry to office everyday. Been 2 years now. No complaints\n",
      "Didn't work. Poor service. Four batteries. Three work. Costs as much to return as the battery. Poor service from Amazon.\n",
      "Love these batteries I use them for led lights. Work well. Long life. Easy to recharge. We will see about life span.\n",
      "Don’t hold a charge We bought these to use in a cat toy that my cat is obsessed with. We were flying through batteries!! The first couple uses they held up well, but now they don’t hold a charge longer than a few minutes. Pretty disappointed!\n",
      "Great They seem to have good battery life and work great\n",
      "Good First cycle capacity test. Seems legit.\n",
      "Seem pretty good These are ok, they aren't as expensive as name brand and seem to work ok.\n",
      "Doesnt hold as much charge as expected Don’t last as long as expected.  Used a fully charged on my kevo door and only lasted 2 months while regular batteries last over 10 months.\n",
      "Perfect Works as designed.\n",
      "Good Quality Reliable\n",
      "Useless Only got a few charges from these batteries, now completely dead.\n",
      "These are great I have used these and have charged them a lot\n",
      "I’m happy ! Good price and good durability\n",
      "Surpassed expectations I'm actually quite surprised in the quality and durability of this product. One of the best rechargeable batteries I've owned because it seems to have a longer lasting charge than the others. I'll definitely be buying more of these and recommend them to family and friends.\n",
      "so far so good! I purchased these for my automated shades in the bathroom, one sides batteries keep dying and I was tired of buying new batteries all the time, (it takes 8 batteries.)  So we've got these in now and when it dies I will just recharge and then put back in!  They are going strong!\n",
      "Excellent for high battery draining devices I use them for my Harmony Remote Control and for my DSLR. Two devices that drain a lot of batteries. This last a lot and charge super fast with the Amazon travel charger.\n",
      "Works well! These came packaged well and work as expected.  Fully charged and ready to go!\n",
      "Not the best Didn't hold a charge very long. Disappointed. Seems more like a 500mA battery\n",
      "Gamer Approved for Xbox One , Wireless Controllers Gamer Approved for Xbox wireless controllers. I am a daily Xbox One player. I Use the Amazon Basics instead of main brand rechargeable. It may because they are new, but they seem to last better than other Brands AA's. I recharge them in the old AA charger from another brand and it works fine. Great value for price, holds a good charge.\n",
      "Working but Kept on charging even after 12 hours, still need to test The battery looks durable and is working.However when i tried to charge it, it kept on charging even after 12 hours..Have to continuously observe how this one goes...\n",
      "Better than Enloops I use these for high drain camera speedlights as a professional photographer.They maintain a charge well, have a very consistent voltage curve up until the last couple flashes (fast, consistent recycle times), and in general just outperform my white Enloop batteries by about %5 while costing about %60 less.The + protrusion is a little short though for a few electronics. Only problem I've had with it is my computer mouse so not a big deal.\n",
      "NOT as good as eneloop, but rechargeables cheap enough to dispose of if necessary. OK, I read reviews and answered questions that stated that these were just as good as eneloop batteries. They are NOT. I don't have fancy meters or anything, but I do have practical application experience. I work nights. I use a Zebralight SC52 flashlight all the time. I use this light At LEAST 5-6 times a night for taking the dog out, going to the car, and even indoors when looking into dark cabinets and such. I get three weeks to a month between swapping Eneloops. I bought these thinking that is was a better deal, but I'm swapping batteries with these weekly.They work well enough, but they just don't have the longevity of the better brand. I use these on cheap flashlights with no current regulators because they are cheap enough that I don't care if they burn up. For that reason, I have purchased a second batch. They are rechargables which are cheap enough to be disposed of if necessary.\n",
      "Best rechargeable for the money I believe they are the best for the money rechargeable battery on the market. I purchased aa’s and aaa’s so far and I have watched several youtube videos which seem to back this up.\n",
      "They last a long time! Great battery, great price, fast shipping!!\n",
      "Less longevity compared to other brands They don't last as long as other brands.\n",

      "Buy these. Exactly what I needed.\n",
      "If the replacements don’t work any better, I’m getting my money back. They were supposed to be charged, ready to use. They did not. I charged them to see if they’d hold a charge. Of the eight, two were still low after a charge. If the replacements don’t work any better, I’m getting my money back.\n",
      "Seems to be a good quality product at a decent price I use these for rechargeable headlamps when working on my car as well as Radios. They seem to have good longevity, hold charges nicely, I've only had him for a few months I can't speak of longevity but so far so good\n",
      "BUY THE WHITE WRAPPED BATTERIES, NOT THESE GRAY ONES! I have other Amazon Basics batteries and these are the worst. Of the 3 types I’ve bought, the battery life on almost every single one of these has been drained and, when I try to recharge them, it shows an “error” message now. The batteries I ordered in 2016 are still going strong, but these that I ordered in 2017 are ruined. It’s a huge waste of money.If you want good quality Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries, BUY THE WHITE WRAPPED BATTERIES, NOT THESE GRAY ONES!\n",
      "Battery not arrive in the package In the order that I make of three different items the battery is the only item that not arrive in the package.\n",
      "Excellent quality & fast shipping!!! Excellent quality & fast shipping!!!\n",
      "Let down Batteries do not hold charge. I invested pretty heavily in AA and AAA rechargeable batteries from Amazon. After approximately a year- i find nearly every one of the batteries are not recharging, or are losing charge extremely fast. I'm having to replace my remote batteries every month, as opposed to every 4 months. Lots of similar anecdotal examples... Don't get me wrong- for the year i've used them- they saved me money...but i won't be reinvesting in these again.\n",
      "replaced worn batteries These replaced worn out rechargeable batteries and they work fine.  Good value for the price.\n",
      "I'm Recommended Thank you, nice to deal with you.\n",
      "Much better than Duracell’s and Energizers Very affordable, charge lasts longer the lead brands\n",
      "Great batteries and cheap Two of the batteries keep loosing charge quickly, trying to figure out which one it is\n",
      "Meh, they're ok. Look at eneloop black Decent for the price, but I don't know that these batteries stand up to their rated amp hour capacity. I only get one to two work days out of my headlamp with these batteries where I would get about a week from alkaline. These DO NOT come fully charged, and I have a few that hold less of a charge than others, so quality control is lacking. I had high hopes, these are reviewed well and showed well in testing online. But I might tend toward spending the money for eneloop next time.\n",
      "Work well The seem to work fine.\n",
      "Reliable Very reliable batteries. I’ve owned a few for about a year now and still holding good charge.\n",
      "Only 1/3 life At fully charged battery only lasts 1/3, compared to eneloop. I use it's on my LED candles lights. I don't know if some of its are defected r not, but would not it again. I don't like to return things, so I use it on mine keyboard and mouse, it work.\n",
      "Great value Work great for portable scanner or energy hungry applications.\n",
      "Good Value I hate disposable batteries.These are great.\n",
      "Don't hold a charge Don't bother.  They only recharged twice before they wouldn't hold a charge anymore.\n",
      "I’d like to return them but I don’t know where I was only able to charge two of the eight batteries up to 1.5 bowls otherwise the other ones were up to 1.45 V so I could charge him too I think there’s a piece of junk\n",
      "Do Not Last I bought these for my five Panasonic phones. They just do not last.  I’m sorry I bought.\n",
      "Still haven't had to charge it yet They take way longer than my other batteries to charge, and they're also way heavier. Still haven't charged yet, over a week of playing xbox one.\n",
      "Good stuff recommend it Good stuff recommend it\n",
      "Great pricing and great product Very happy with my purchase.  Batteries work great!\n",
      "Great product These batteries last forever.\n",
      "do not last I originally thought these were good batteries. But after 2 charges, they stopped charging. They came with the amazon charger and every time I try and charge them it flashes red indicating a bad battery. I tried throwing some really old energizer rechargeables in the charger and they worked fine. I strongly do not recommend these batteries. These are actually a replacement that I got after the first batch did the same exact thing.\n",
      "It's nice looking perfect\n",
      "No problems. Using these in a Sangean portable radio.  we recharge them in the radio every couple weeks.  No problems.\n",
      "Garbage. Go with a better brand These things are garbage. I purchased a digital charger that shows charge state. They showed up with 35% charge. I tried to charge them. Even though the charger says 100% charge, they clearly are not. I have a separate led battery checker and it shows them barely charged. The batteries fried the first electronic I put them in. Thank god it wasn't too expensive.\n",
      "Good Quality, Made in Japan Exactly as described, Made in Japan, came pre-charged.\n",
      "Rechargable? Hardly. We've had these for exactly one month, and ever since maybe the second cycle they started dying faster and faster. Now they don't even hold a charge. It's infuriating.\n",
      "Wont be disappointed I can not say enough about these batteries! A few years back we ordered a set because they were not expensive and therefore we wouldn't be out much if they were crap. To my slight surprise,  these babies have not only lasted, but have kept their charge rate over the years. We now have over 60 Amazon batteries!Only batteries we will ever buy again. Just wish they had more sizes.\n",
      "Come precharged still testing So far so good\n",
      "I received it in two days. Rechargeable batteries for my thermostat.\n",
      "Great value Great value and long lasting\n",
      "Excellent Excellent\n",
      "Not that long lasting I had bought the blue amazon ones prior to these and the blue ones still last longer! These were suppose to be better. Not so.\n",
      "Love these batteries Great quality battery\n",
      "Great Rechargeable Batteries Very good rechargeable NiMH batteries.\n",
      "Good batteries, too bad they are too big... Quality batteries, too bad it's trial and error finding out in which device you can use them because they are a little bigger than regular AAA batteries. I guess we are free to use another brand if we want to avoid frustration....\n",
      "Saving money with every charge! Rotate these through for game controller.  No more spending money on regular batteries!  I should have done this a long time ago.\n",
      "works so far the product has been working consistently as i expected i would say over a month i have saved about 6 batteries that i would have otherwise bought disposable ones\n",
      "Good for the price Didn’t last real long after re-charging, but good for the price\n",
      "Great Battery for the money Good battery so far so good\n",
      "Charge hold time is horrible. Product did not hold charge longer than 2.5 hours.\n",
      "These have been repeatable charged, work well. So happy to have re chargeable. These suit my needs very well. It’s been a few months-no problems.\n",
      "good price performs well enough. good job thank you\n",
      "not enough power received the batteries and placed the batteries in my brand new alarm clock and they didn't have enough power to get the alarm clock working. I thought the alarm clock was defective. I contacted the vendor and they sent me a new alarm clcok and 2 free batteries, the alarm clock worked very well with the free batteries. Unfortunately, any of these batteries do not power my alarm clock, Very disappointed...\n",
      "Short battery life I haven't found the batteries to last long between charges when using a moderately high-usage device.  I fully charged all the batteries before using them for the first time.  I'm not impressed.\n",
      "A MUST have for Xbox one Tired of going through countless batteries on your xbox one controller? Get these! Depending on how much you game, these batteries last 10x (if not more) then your common alkaline type. Very happy I found them!\n",
      "Would buy name-brand next time Do not last as long as regular named batteries like Duracell etc\n",
      "Good Discharge Rate So Far Using onstage in wireless microphones and instrument transmitters. So far, they discharge similar to pro-version AA cells and avoid e-waste.\n",
      "big its a bit bigger then normal batteries\n",
      "Great Great\n",
      "great battery life little slow with the recharge but overall good\n",
      "Shows only 80% after charging for Comcast X1 remote I have two Xfinity X1 remotes and both show only 80% charged after I charged them once I received them in the mail.  My first remote is down to 70% now after ONE DAY of usage.  I normally get 3 months from alkaline batteries, but not with these, I'll get a week.  Will not buy again.\n",
      "Iffy Not too sure about how these are going to work. First used in a flashlight and it heated up to the point where it was hard to hold. Might try them in something else.\n",
      "Gotta have em After Christmas we stocked up and they work great. Love that you can just recharge instead of throwing them away.\n",
      "They work. They may be eneloop These are Amazon's recharables, which we got to replace in our solar garden lights. They are better than the batteries that come with the lights and glow all night midwinter in Montana - that's saying something since in December here it's dark before 5 pm.  I suspect other reviews are correct that they are much higher quality batteries being repackaged. A good buy.\n",
      "Great value Reliably good, but every once in a while, one or more in a multipack is mildly faulty, having less capacity than other batteries.  Would still buy as they are fantastic value compared to the premium brands\n",
      "Well made and give good performance. They arrive 'precharged', but put them in one of my fancy chargers just to top them off. I'd been using Duracell AAA batteries in my MP3 player while working out. When my last Duracell gave out, I put one of these in, and it seems like it will hold up as long as the Duracell .. but its rechargeable. I carry a spare in my pocket, just to be sure I don't run flat during a workout session. Not the highest capacity, but on a value basis, I recommend them.\n",
      "Good quality Worked perfect our cordless phones\n",
      "great product works just as well as any other rechargeable battery but for a cheaper price. cant go wrong with that.\n",
      "AmazonBasics Recharging Batteries This are very good batteries. I use them daily. They have a long lasting charge depending on your use. Great buy.\n",
      "longevity they work great when first charged but charge doesn't last very long\n",
      "Every cycle more batteries go dead and will not charge I bought the AA High Capacity Amazon rechargeable batteries for batter-powered candles that I keep lit as part of my home decor; therefore, I've bought enough batteries that are waiting in the wings to be placed in the candles when the other recharged batteries in the candles lose power. Every time I go to recharge the batteries, there are about 2 out of 8 batteries that WILL NOT RE-CHARGE, and I have to throw them away. It's not the charger. I use two different chargers (two different brands). This is disappointing. I'm trying a different brand.\n",
      "doesn't work with all products doesn't work with all products\n",
      "Not worth the money One, then two, now three maybe four won't charge up all the way. None of them even get warm when they are charged or being charged.\n",
      "Bien Buenas\n",
      "Excellent value great value for these batteries. they maintain a long charge and quick to recharge. no loss to date\n",
      "Made in japan These are made in japan not china. All the Japanese amazon basics batteries i have bought have worked great. the china ones not so much\n",
      "Won't hold charge Batteries worked one time. Charged them as directed,  used in camera and never worked again after recharging.\n",
      "Best value and preformance rechargeables out there! Great batteries. This is the 4th set I have bought . Keep adding smart door locks and more and more kid toys that require batteries. And I always purchase these ! Last a very long time and save me tons\n",
      "Future will tell about durability and battery life Purchased theese for electric Pepper/Salt Grinder, Wireless Mouse ... and they do the job so far.Contrary to the description, they did NOT arrive allready charged.\n",
      "Try a different brand. After a full charge, I was disappointed in the length of power.\n",
      "Good Good\n",
      "Charge doesn't last Either these batteries or the Panasonic charger are bogus.  I bought to use in  battery hogging Browining Trail camera.  When \"fully\" charged the camera says these Amazon NI-MH are at 68%.  New AA non-rechargeable batteries show 100%.  Under normal camera conditions, i.e., 40 videos of 20 seconds, these batteries last 2 nighrs.  An Enegizer non-rechargable lasts 5-6 nights.  Either the Panasonic charger or the Amazon batteries are not as advertised.\n",
      "AmazonBasics AA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries Batteries- Rechargeable Amazon Batteries in an 8 pack!! Whoo-hoo they worked well and since they are rechargeable they let me remember not to buy new ones very often all I have to do is look outside and see if the solar lights are still working.\n",
      "Good batteries Low cost batteries seem to have good capacity.\n",
      "Did Not Last I tried the batteries in my Roku remote and they lasted only one day. I am not sure if they came with full charge.\n",
      "Great replacement for a post top light The original batteries were failing in a post top light. The light is charged by an included solar panel. The lights work through the night and last a couple of days when the sun does not shine\n",
      "If you have devices that eat batteries give these a try. I use these for my mouse, TV remote, decorative lamps and dispensers. I know that I save.\n",
      "Fairly good price with a good battery life. After burning through an entire box of Duracell AA batteries in my Xbox controllers (and other gadgets & remotes) I went back to using rechargeable batteries, these AmazonBasics were highly rated and so far each set I have used has lasted much longer then regular store bought batteries. I have used the Energizer AA rechargeables and those worked well for a year before they all stopped working (price was like $15 for batteries and base, but didn't last super long); I have also used the Eneloop AA batteries (more expensive and again, only lasted about a year before they started dying). I will update this review with more info once I know for sure, but so far so good.\n",
      "Works great Works great...except in cold temperatures.\n",

      "Perfect Very good\n",
      "WORK FINE FOR ME Primarily use these in LED candles that run for 5 hours at a time.  The batteries last a few weeks before needing to be recharged, so I just keep rotating them.\n",
      "Works great Best investment ever I highly recommend\n",
      "Perfect for headlamps Got these for my Dad because he wears a headlamp ALL THE TIME and burns through AAA batteries like crazy. These are the first batteries that have lasted a full day for him. Woot! Definitely recommend.\n",
      "A good durable battery. I usually purchase eneloop rechargeable batteries but these Amazon AAA’s were very competitive on price. I don’t know if they deliver the same runtimes but they performed well for me.\n",

      "Good Battery I've been using rechargeable batteries for a few years now - it's basically all I have in my house at this point.  We go through quite a bit of AAs because my 3 kids love the video games and the controllers go through batteries quite frequently.  I have 2 chargers charging 8 batteries at all times and probably another 12 that are constantly being used.  The batteries are switched out frequently and after more than a year I can't tell a difference in their power or longevity.  Actually, the only batteries I have that I feel are getting weak are the original batteries that came with my charger and have a little pink bunny on the side.  I am extremely happy with these batteries and will continue to purchase these rechargeable cylinders of awesome from now on.\n",
      "Good Start to fall apart after a few months still working though\n",

      "Used for Xbox Works great for the Xbox one controller\n",
      "great value i can't speak for battery life yet as I've only used them for 2 charging cycles, but they seem to parallel conventional batteries.  be sure when storing them next to each other that the poles are facing the same direction to prolong their life\n",

      "Great value. Value for price.\n",

      "Good if you use a lot of AAA I used them mostly for some Christmas decorations that used AAAs and I didn’t want to blast through them. They don’t seem to last as long as a traditional battery but it’s close.\n",
      "Good batteries My kids use them in there video game controllers, seem to last a long time.\n",
      "Don't hold a charge. I bought these to replace old energizer rechargeable batteries.  My old energizer still hold a charge for over twice that long as these brand new batteries.  I'm going back to energizer.\n",
      "Random batteries are dying quickly. I'm using them in LED lights in my kitchen. They don't get used that often. I've only charged them ALL twice total. However, random batteries within the pack are just dying off and not holding charge. It seems to be progressive because now, even more batteries are experiencing these problems. Regular batteries lasted about a year. These will only last a month or so of very little use before needing recharging. I think they're just discharging on their own, which is bad. Quality control seems to be lacking on these.\n",

      "All good intentions ... The charge does not last more than a few days.\n",
      "Why are people just throwing batteries away? This boggles my mind. We create so much waste in this country. Why make more when there is a good solution that actually saves you money, too? These are great and I don't worry about how to get rid of my batteries properly.\n",
      "Pass on these. Not appropriate for disaster planning Pass. Go with a high quality brand name. This are made china pieces of crap. Bought multiple sizes and all last 25% of a standard Duracell. We recycled ours and now looking for better quality. I’m glad I tested them as they were acquired for disaster planning (i.e. power outage, mass storm, etc).  Do they recharge? Yes. Would I put my families reliance on them during a storm or power outage. COLD day in hell.\n",

      "Work well These batteries work well as they should.  Seem to hold a charge a long time.  I'm still on my first charge so I can't speak to how many charges they will do.\n",
      "Good value, good power They get heavy use, and hold up well\n",
      "Won't hold a charge Only holds a charge for a couple of hours in a wireless mouse.  They don't use that much power.\n",
      "Precharged? LOL. They either arrived dead or have a fast shelf discharge rate Not sure which, but I had to charge all of them.  Shelf life remains to be seen.\n",
      "So far so good. *Updated 3 months after purchase. Updated 3 months later: These lasted 3 months on one charge and of the 4 AA's I had in a Staircase light, one battery went bad, short circuited and would not recharge anymore. So now I am down one AA, but probably still saving my money so I took away one star.>Original Review: Easy charging and lasts pretty long - we bought these for stair lights and they are great! They've been in for 3 weeks now on our motion sensor staircase lights and still going strong. We have Cats and they constantly set them off, so I am happy they are rechargeable and that they last long (so far)!\n",
      "No Difference I bought these to use in my camera flash. I had used Envelop before. These are JUST as good as my former rechargeables.\n",
      "Good Overall Have spent the last couple years switching over to all rechargeables. These are as good as the others thus far. Do not seem to hold peak charge as long as I would like. Overall I am happy with them.\n",
      "Quality is WAY down. Do NOT buy. Initially these batteries were nearly identical to the Eneloop batteries. Recently this has changed. New batteries will have minimum life, little to no storage ability and consistent low voltage.These used to last for months in remotes and bluetooth keyboards, etc. The new versions give me 3 weeks at best. Charged batteries that are stored lose their charge at a very high rate as well. I would count on 1 month of storage. Even at full charge the batteries often cannot get to the full 1.2V that the specification says. This has been tested across multiple batches.I loved these, but the quality is just gone now.\n",
      "Gave 2 stars because THEY DO NOT FIT in a normal battery compartment for AA batteries I bought both the AA and AAA battery packs and thought I would give them a try.  They seemed to be a good value BUT I Gave them only 2 stars because THEY DO NOT FIT in a normal battery compartment for AA batteries. They would not fit in 5 different items such as our electric toothbrushes, pedicure sander, etc.  We FINALLY found an item that they would fit in which was our battery operated CANDLES.  The fat candles with timers for xx number of hours on and auto turn off.  The battery compartment in the candles was large enough to accommodate the batteries BUT NONE of the other items would fit the batteries so as some of the other reviewers may have said they are SLIGHTLY Larger if you have a tight fit battery compartment.  It seems that the \"covering\" on the battery extends longer on the bottom and you can't remove or trim it to get them to fit in tight battery compartments.  So I will NOT be purchasing any more of these.  Soooo disappointed : (  Can't speak to the life of the battery as I have not had them long enough to have input on that.  Would not recommend due to the \"fit\" issue.\n",

      "Very good value. These last a long time and hold their charge well, especially for the price.\n",
      "Decent rechargeable batteries, but capacity drains over time I use these in my Xbox One controllers.  At first they were great and they are definitely higher capacity than other Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries that I've used for the same purpose, but I've definitely noticed a significant decline in how long they stay charged after only a few months of continuous use.  I'm still using them (rotating 2 at a time between the controller and keeping a spare pair ready to go when the first one runs out) but I just have to switch them out more frequently compared to when I first got them.\n",
      "Good for about a year They worked well for about a year.  Using them in Xbox controllers and charging every few days.  They started to hold less charge after about a year so we ordered more.  Really to be expected so pretty satisfied with these.\n",
      "satisfied fast and a good product. arrived on time. perfect item exactly as described. easy to use.\n",

      "No Charge Batteries These batteries arrived in 2 packs of four. The first set I had to recharge out of the box. The second set won’t hold a charge even when recharged. I took it to the battery store and they said they have no way of testing whether they are charged. I was hoping to be environmentally conscious about the use of batteries but I had to purchase regular batteries and will not purchase these again.\n",
      "Pretty good & reliable I bought these and they’re pretty good. So good that I bought the 8 pack after I bought the 4 pack so I always have charged batteries to use when others are used or need charging.\n",
      "Good batteries Recommended to slowcharge first\n",
      "Seems like great value Got these to replace batteries in our handsets.  They fit perfectly and last as long as we remember the originals did when those were new.  So far we've had them for 2 months so can't really comment on durability.  As long as they last even decently well they're a GREAT value.\n",
      "As expected As expected\n",
      "NOT SURE THE PROBLEM I charged these and well they were good for 1 charge- work ok for my wireless keypad and mouse, but on my keyless door entry- first time charge, or recharged.... neither set worked. Had to go to the dollar general for backups so I wouldn't be locked out of my house.  Disappointed to say the least\n",

I tried charging multiple times, using different chargers and it just won't hold a charge. When I buy batteries, I expect that they will all work. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 mostly because they are a good value.\n",

      "AmazonBasics AA rechargeable batteries. The AmazonBasics AA rechargeable batteries are a great product.  I am a professional photographer and use them in all my flashes.  They have a great capacity.  I would say 90% of the capacity of non-rechargeable Duracell batteries.  I have recharged them over 100 times and I don't see any signs of them losing capacity.\n",

      "I've tested them, and so far, they are as advertised! First, read the top-rated review from NLee the Engineer, and then go look at his reviews for comparable batteries for some background.I've owned and used 4th-generation standard Eneloop batteries for several years, but it's only been in the past year that I got more serious about looking into different brands and testing for Ni-MH rechargeable batteries.  First, if you're only knowledge of rechargeable batteries is the NiCad versions from the 90's, modern rechargeables are MUCH better than that.  In fact, while they start off at a slightly lower charge than 1.5V alkalines, alkalines quickly burn off that charge and continue to do so, to the point where 1.25V Ni-MH batteries actually output more voltage after about 30 minutes of use, and often remain usable for longer.Sanyo/Panasonic's Eneloop brand was a pioneer of the Ni-MH battery in the late 2000's, and some of those early versions still perform quite well by current standards.  A typical capacity for a \"standard\" Eneloop is around 1900-2000 mAh.  But there are increasingly \"high-capacity\" Ni-MH batteries that claim even higher capacities - perhaps 2300 (EBL), 2400 (Amazon High-Capacity), 2600 (Mr. Batt), or even 2800 mAh (EBL, again).Based on testing results and circumstantial evidence collected by consumers, it appears likely that many (but not all) of the original AmazonBasics rechargeable were simply re-branded models of early-version Eneloops.  This \"high-capacity\" version, then appears to be re-brand (or at least a functional equivalent) of the Eneloop XX model, which was later named the \"Eneloop Pro\".I tested capacity with an OPUS BT-C2000 Charger/Analyzer.  You do this by charging the battery fully, then discharging it fully, while the BT-C2000 measures the amount of power discharged until it is \"empty\".  The results for the Amazon High-Capacity brand were as good (or better than advertised).  For the 8 AA batteries I tested, the capacity ranged from 2357 to 2404 mAH - a remarkably narrow window reflecting good quality control.  For the 4 AAA batteries I tested, the range was 826 to 856 mAh - impressive given that the packaging indicates only a \"minimum of 800 mAh\".I think unless you are looking at using them in digital cameras or other very high-drain devices, the high-capacity rechargeables probably are not a necessity, and investing in a good stable of standard Ni-MH batteries is a better investment.  But for a much better price than the Eneloop Pro's, these AmazonBasics High-Capacity batteries seem to be the real deal.NOTE: I will update my post over time if I notice any significant changes in their performance.  Note that I did not do any testing for \"self-discharge\" rate, another metric for rechargeables relating to how quickly they lose power \"on the shelf\".\n",

      "These batteries don't hold a charge! I purchased both AA and AAA sizes of these batteries to use in flameless candles with timers. These batteries are horrible!! They lasted for 15 hours, 3 days of use, and needed to be recharged. Four of them were in the charger all day and over night and we're still not recharged. I have been using the black Amazon Basics AA and AAA batteries for about 6 months and they are okay but don't hold a charge as well as the Duracel and Energizers I have. Rechargeable batteries are not cheap. I don't mind paying for them if they last, it's definately worth it. But these are rip off!! I would return them but no longer have the packaging they came in. I'm really disappointed and disgusted! An addendum: I neglected to mention that I charged the batteries before I used them for the first time.Edit 1/8/2019: My problem has been resolved. Amazon quickly responded to my issue. I received a full refund as well as a replacement of batteries. Thanks!!\n",
      "Junk, don't buy Charged up the batteries on arrival, went to use them 2 months later. DEAD. Not worth the money, buy Eneloops.\n",
      "Were great at first, then died, then re-charged We bought these 2-years ago, used in a remote-controlled race car set.  They lasted a long time, recharged fine, then we put the race cars away for a while, the batteries drained, then I was left with 6 batteries that would not recharge.  The cars were left on, so apparently, if you run these down to zero and let them sit, they are dead.  However, I left them on my La Crosse charger for a while and they started charging!  Back to racing..Note - Warranty is only 1-year, Amazon's support center sends you to a dead end for over 1-year.\n",
      "The basic is good enough No need to look some where else these batteries do the job well\n",
      "Disappointed I am finding that the battery life of these is very short, even after a full charge.  I bought these for my Christmas decorations, to try to use fewer disposable batteries, but whereas Duracells typically last me the whole season, these fade in energy after about a week, and then go out.  Quite disappointed.\n",

      "A Great Saving on batteries I got those because my flameless LED candles are consuming batteries like drinking water. I had to look for rechargeable ones to save some money.  Like one of the reviews said that they drained very fast for the first time. But after recharged it for the 2nd time, they hold well. I definitely have saved some money by replacing all regular batteries with those.\n",
      "Batteries could have a longer charge life Works okay\n",
      "Stopped working Being that we have to buy so many batteries, I bought this hoping to use less and use rechargeable batteries. But it will not turn on anymore which means it won’t charge and we have to buy more batteries!! Hopefully they can send me a new one and exchange this one .\n",

      "Poor Performance in wireless mouse I have a wireless mouse that used cheap non-rechargeable batteries about every 4 months.  I figured I'd save money in the long run with rechargables.  Poor decision.  These last about 2 weeks and need recharging.  Never charge to full capacity and I'm using a digital smart-recharger.  I'm going to throw them away because they are junk.  $10 wasted.\n",
      "Stopped charging aftetr a year Going back to Enloop, these are not made to last. The point of rechargeable batteries is they need to work well in the long run to save over disposable batteries.\n",

Using regular alkaline batteries I get about 10 nights of light (60 hours) before they are too dim to see.  With these,  the lights were bright only the first night (6 hours).  The 2nd night they were dim, and by the 3rd there was no juice left.  I would take them out in the morning, charge all day until putting back in for lights to run from 5 to 11 p.m.  Even the first night out of the package they were bright only for about 1/2 hour then quickly dim even though they are supposed to arrive fully charged.\n",

Come wrapped in packs of 4, the battery life is pretty amazing for what I use them for at least, Xbox One Controller for the kids I got them 2 weeks ago and the remote has not died yet. Pretty good batteries amazon, they could spice up the battery wrap though and make it cooler but that’s neither here nor there also they are 240 mAh if anyone was curious I’ve gotten like 64bof these total aa and aaa’s\n",
      "Good price nice product So far so good. Let see how long is the battery life.\n",
      "Buyer beware I have not purchased these but after reading some reviews these sound like nothing more than rebranded EBL batteries, which I HAVE purchased. (The dead giveaway are the complaints of the battery diameter being slightly larger than standard, thus making them hard to fit into certain devices. This is one of the very issues with EBL.) The EBL batteries have a horrible shelf life and lose a ton of capacity if not used/recharged frequently. That said, their initial capacity is generous, about 30% more than many others.\n",
      "Great to have. No issues so far.\n",
      "DOA I have purchased these before and they worked fine. Just ordered 2 packs.... when they arrived they were dead - strange considering they were supposed to be pre-charged.... put them into a battery charger and these do not hold charge at all. Both 4 packs are DOA! Going back.... seems that others have exact same issue and Amazon should do better QA.\n",
      "Slightly larger than others in circumference These batteries have been working pretty much as well as others I have bought, as far as I can tell, but they are slightly larger around than others.I have found that with one item that uses them it's hard to get them in and out, and it scarred one of them a bit. So, if what you have is smaller, so that the fit of the batteries is snug, like in a flashlight, I would not recommend these for that reason alone. I thought I would never get the battery out!\n",
      "Charge life I have not used these batteries enough time to b able to give an accurate review but so far so good.I am using them in my wireless Panasonic phones and they seem to keep the charge for a few days of use having the phones off the charger.\n",
      "16 batteries and all bad possibly... Purchased 16 batteries and every one arrived 12/22/18 half charged. I decided to charge 2 out of each pack on a new high end charger/tester.

      "Buyer beware. I have several versions of Amazon rechargeable batteries.  I have always loved Amazon products and I was a big fan when I first bought the batteries. I mainly use these in all of my LED candles that I have all over my house on timers.  Unfortunately, they just don’t last very long before they die and need to be recharged. Even worse, they are now no longer taking a charge at all.  I can’t tell you how many I have had to throw away. Sad and upsetting.  I can’t say that I would recommend buying them and as much money as I have spent buying them...I would not purchase them again!\n",

      "Not recommended Plastic cover on ouside of battery comes off with time. Charge begins to dwindle to nothing very quickly. I use these for fairy lights for the office and the charge doesnt even last to keep the lights bright for an hour after a night of charging... and these fairy lights take 3 AA batteries. Would not recommend.\n",

      "Do not recommend Worst purchase I have made, I had high hopes for this product, since it is supposedly made in Japan, marked as High Capacity. After half an hour in my headlamp, batteries died. Charged longer than eneloop, than used them again to see the same result. Cheap batteries from Bjs Wholesales last a lot longer, and they are throw away alkalines. I regret paying so much and getting worthless items\n",
      "Good but not great charge I would have given these a 3 because of their charged-life, but the price is good and better than throwing disposables out or having to recycle them. I would say these last about 1/3 of the life of a Duracell in an XBox controller, so the return on investment is probably a year for us. Sticking one of these in a device that lasts a few years just doesn't ever seem like it would be worth doing so...\n",
      "Do not hold a charge and completely dead after 2 uses These died quickly and did not hold a charge at all after 2nd recharge.\n",

My son has a light he loves to leave on (3 year olds...) and we forget to turn off as well. It tends to burn through batteries so we got these. These last way longer than the previous ones we used and charge quicker than I was expected. Highly recommend.\n",
      "So far so good, they hold charge decently Could last a bit longer, but they are good for what they are.\n",
      "So far the batteries work as advertised good price\n",
      "Not so good. I charged it through 3 different charges, it coming as same results, put into my door lock on a full charged, it reads 97% most n it drain fast, vs regular non chargeable on the same lock it stays 100% for over a month. Disappointed\n",
      "Good Good\n",
      "Way cheaper that battery packs Motorola radios\n",
      "Good buy. Arrived fast and as described.\n",
      "Be careful, these  batteries are larger than regular AA batteries These batteries will work in most devices, but they are fatter than regular AA batteries.  I have some Maglite flashlights where the batteries will not fit.  Regular AA batteries or other brands of rechargeables slide right into these flashlights, but the Amazon ones won't even go into the tube.  I would be afraid to use these in a device where the batteries go in with some tightness because I might not be able to get them out again. Devices where the batteries just go into a slot would probably be fine.\n",
      "Pretty good batteries.. I use these in my outdoor solar lights. Don't notice much of a difference between these and EBL 2800 mAh side-by-side though.\n",
      "Bought these to use in a Panasonic household phone I bought a Panasonic battery phone about a year ago and it started acting up.  I decided to take a chance and replaced the batteries with these.  It worked and the phone is now working fine.  I have not had it long enough to speak about battery life or durability.\n",
      "five star nice\n",
      "Junk I ordered these batteries and the correct charger that was indicated on amazon. They charged pretty quickly. My kids put them in their wii remotes and played for a few weeks until they were dead. Now the batteries won’t charge in the charger anymore. Junk.\n",
      "Just as good as Energizer and other know brands These are the only rechargeable batteries I use now.\n",
      "Not worth it 2 of the packs did not work at all!!!\n",
      "They started out great, but capacity has diminished over time, faster than Eneloop batteries I found that in the initial year of use, these performed pretty well in terms of discharge and recharge rates.  But into 2 years of ownership, I've found their capacity has dropped.  One cell died.  Comparing to the performance and reliability of another rechargeable AA battery brand, I'm not satisfied with these batteries and won't buy them again.\n",
      "Batteries not pre-charged Batteries did not come pre-charged, in fact all 8 were fully drained and needed a full charge.\n",
      "Not Rebranded Eneloops- Don’t Buy These Batteries are not durable enough for me. I’ve had them a couple of years and charged them 10 to 15 times. Now they are completely gone. Will not charge on any of my chargers. I have multiple high end chargers so that is not the issue. These cannot be Eneloops rebranded. I still have Eneloops from 2009 that have been cycled 100s of times and still charge to capacity. Bottom line don’t buy. I bought some of the regular capacity Amazon rechargeable batteries which used to be White now they are Black. I have not had any issue with them yet. So I would say they are probably ok.\n",
      "Terrible. Battery power doesnt last long Quality is terrible. The batteries die quicky.  Can charge for almost two days but when put into device it registers as only half full charge. I think they are more of a hassle than what you pay for them\n",
      "Lasted 3 years, eneloops going on 10. Not much more to say than that. These saw mild use in gaming controllers, 10hrs/week max. I would charge them once a week and now they can't even hold a charge for an hour.I will not buy again.\n",
      "Nice Batteries!! These batteries have worked great for me in the past, and the price is good.\n",
      "work good for me I use these for remotes and other things around the house. they work great for me\n",
      "On time and work great Very happy with order\n",
      "Good rechargeable batteries I needed rechargeable batteries for my candles. And this one satisfies my expectations.\n",
      "Essentially a single use battery Poor quality! I recently bought these batteries for electric holiday candles. I successfully charged each battery before it’s first use, but after only one use only 2 of the 8 batteries would charge again. I’ve never had this problem before with rechargeable batteries and don’t recommend wasting your money on these.\n",
      "A must if you have kids Over the past year I have been buying these monthly to power all my kids toys and flashlights and wow iv saved alot on batteries this year\n",
      "Started leaking Used these for a RC car. One of the batteries started leaking battery acid all over after the first use. The rest have been ok and battery life is good.\n",
      "as stated as stated\n",
      "Like Like\n",
      "Great value & quality! Love these.  Great quality!\n",
      "they die so fast i am re-writing this review because it is far worse than i thought originallyi got these to save some cash on batteries for my VR headset controllers... unfortunately the controllers tell me that these batteries are on the brink of death after a full charge. the batteries will only last around 2 hours tops before quitting.i also found that after a couple days part of one of the batteries started peeling away.the last straw for me was- after months of using these i decided to try some energizers in my controllers and low and behold: it registered a full charge and i was able to play for more than 2 hours. i honestly cant even see these being useful in something as low power as a TV remote.\n",
      "Batteries I was a little iffy about getting them since I’ve been using energizer rechargeable for many years on gaming controllers but I figured only one way to find out and for the price it was definitely worth a shot and I’m quite impressed I’d say my controller with a gaming headset hooked as well it will probably get 8 hours being on before I have to grab another set which is good considering I swap the batteries once a week maybe and the energizers maybe every 5 days\n",
      "great value work as well or better than some of the national brands\n",
      "Excellent Works as expected.\n",
      "Bettery long life Bettery long life\n",
      "Nothing. We put these in an LED light and nothing happened.  We checked the connection, checked the alignment - nothing.  We thought maybe they weren't as pre-charged as they indicated so we put them in the charger.  After 10 hours it turned green.  We put the freshly charged batteries in the light and...\"  Nothing.  They have as much power as a set of breakfast sausages.\n",
      "Would not work for Medical Electric Stimulator... Voltage too low maybe? Surprisingly, these Rechargeable Batteries charge to only 1.4 volts and would not work on my Medical Electric Stimulator.  I had used several sets of Rechargeable Batteries with the Stimulator since I got the unit several years ago and never had any trouble.  With these Batteries, the unit will not even come on at all.  I can only assume that the other brand Batteries had a slightly higher voltage.  Nothing else makes sense to me.\n",
      "Holds charge nicely and fits all electronics I’ve tried it on. Works great\n",
      "Great Batteries with Great Battery Life I use the basic charger for these which works great and I love these batteries.They last much longer than other comparable products I’ve tried and definitely longer than charge packs or alkaline batteries.Two I have got scuffed or dinged somehow but barely noticeable and they all function great. A full charge typically lasts me hours of intensive gaming or many hours for most other devices.They can feel like they take a bit to charge but if you make sure to keep four charging while you’re using the rest then you should be in good shape.\n",
      "all batteries ship had 1/3 life...in other words ....DEAD!!! all batteries ship had 1/3 life...in other words ....DEAD!!! CANCEL SUBSCRIPTION!!!\n",
      "Durable and Long-lasting I recommend keeping a list of where all the batteries are placed. I have lost a few of these due to forgetting what device they are in.\n",
      "Security Camera Batteries These batteries work fine.  The battery life depends on how often the camera goes off, but they seem to be fine.\n",
      "Fixed Fixed a device that needed them badly, now works perfectly!\n",
      "Batteries advertised as charged.  Totally dead when I received them. Totally dead when I received the batteries.\n",
      "Great Got the new silver ones. The older black label version stopped holding a charge after 3 years.Getting really good life prior to my first charge, so far.I feel as if they fit better than the black label, which were noticeably thicker than regular AA.\n",
      "Good batteries but quality control lacking Out of 8 batteries in the pack i ordered there were 3 that I needed to trim the plastic body casing before I could use them. The casing was  molded over the positive and negative terminals.\n",
      "Great battery Solid performance\n",
      "Great batteries These batteries are awesome!\n"
