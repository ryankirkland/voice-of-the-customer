# Voice of the Customer

## Overview

As an Amazon Seller, or really anyone who sells product, it's important to always be on the lookout for opportunities to fill a niche or an unment consumer demand. In that vein, a seller's number one priority should aways be the customer. In this project, I set out to develop a repeatable process for ingesting, analyzing, and applying consumer feedback to the product discovery process.
